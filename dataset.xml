[[File:Edwardsig.svg|thumb|right|'''Signature of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]]'''&lt;br /&gt;The 'R' and 'I' after his name indicate 'king' and 'emperor' in [[Latin]] ('Rex' and 'Imperator').]]
{{Ranks of Nobility}}
A '''king-emperor''', the female equivalent being '''queen-empress''', is a sovereign ruler who is simultaneously a [[king]] of one territory and [[emperor]] of another. This title usually results from a merger of a royal and imperial crown, but recognises that the two territories are different politically or culturally and in status (emperor being a higher rank than king). It also denotes a king's imperial status through the acquisition of an [[empire]] or vice versa.

The dual title signifies a sovereign's dual role, but may also be created to improve a ruler's prestige. Both cases, however, show that the merging of rule was not simply a case of annexation where one state is swallowed by another, but rather of unification and almost equal status, though in the case of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]] the suggestion that an emperor is higher in rank than a king was avoided by creating the title "king-emperor" ("queen-empress") instead of "emperor-king" ("empress-queen").

== In the British Empire ==
{{See|Emperor of India}}
[[Image:George VI Manchester City Hall 20051020.jpg|thumb|right|A plaque on the [[Manchester Central Library]] records George VI's titles before giving up being Emperor of India.]]
[[File:INDIAGeorge V King Emperor.jpg|thumb|left| Coins of the [[British Raj]] featured the title "King Emperor", such as this [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] coin.]]

The [[British Crown]] had officially taken over the governing of [[British India]] from the [[East India Company]] in 1858, in the aftermath of what the British called 'the [[Indian Mutiny]]'. Henceforth, the new [[British Raj]] was ruled directly from [[Whitehall]] via the [[India Office]]. Following the [[Delhi Durbar]] in 1877, [[Queen Victoria]] was given Imperial status by the British Government, and she assumed the title [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]]. She was thus the Queen-Empress, and her successors, until [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], were known as King-Emperors. This title was the shortened form of [[Style of the British Sovereign#Styles of British sovereigns|the full title]], and in widespread popular use.

The reigning King-Emperors or Queen-Empress used the initials ''R I'' (''[[Rex (title)|Rex]] [[Imperator]]'' or ''Regina Imperatrix'') or the abbreviation ''Ind. Imp.'' (''Indiae Imperator/Imperatrix'') after their name (while the one reigning Queen-Empress, Victoria, used the initials ''R I'', the three consorts of the married King-Emperors simply used ''R'').

[[Coins of the pound sterling|British coins]], and those of the [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[dominion]]s, routinely included some variation of the titles ''Rex Ind. Imp.'', although in India itself the coins said "Empress", and later "King Emperor."  When, in August 1947, India became independent, all dies had to be changed to remove the latter two abbreviations, in some cases taking up to a year.  In [[Great Britain]], coins of George VI carried the title up to 1948.

== In Austria-Hungary ==

Another use of this dual title was when, in 1867, the multi-national [[Austrian Empire]], which was [[Ethnic German|German]]-ruled and facing growing [[nationalism]], undertook a reform that gave nominal and factual rights to [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[nobility]]. This reform revived the Austrian-annexed [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and therefore created the [[personal union|dual-monarchic union]] state of [[Austria-Hungary]] and the dual title of "emperor-king" (in [[German language|German]] ''Kaiser und König'').

The [[Habsburg]] dynasty therefore ruled as [[Emperors of Austria]] over the western and northern half of the Empire ([[Cisleithania]]), and as [[Kings of Hungary]] over the Kingdom of Hungary and much of [[Transleithania]]. Hungary enjoyed some degree of self-government and representation in joint affairs (principally foreign relations and defence). The federation bore the full name of "The Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council and the [[Lands of the Holy Crown of St. Stephen|Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen]]".

== In the Italian colonial empire ==

In 1936, with the [[Italian conquest of Ethiopia]], [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy#Emperor of Ethiopia|Victor Emmanuel III]] was proclaimed [[Emperor of Ethiopia]]. Thus he became King-Emperor (in Italian ''Re Imperatore''), i.e., [[King of Italy]] and [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], because conquered Ethiopia was then an Empire.  In the following years foreign  countries recognized the Italian rule in Ethiopia (UK in 1937).

The King-Emperor was represented by the [[Viceroy of Italian East Africa|Viceroy]], who was also appointed as Governor-General of [[Italian East Africa]] (AOI - Africa Orientale Italiana). The capital city of the Viceroy and [[Governor-General]] was [[Addis Ababa]].

== Titles ==
* The Serbian emperor [[Stefan Dušan]] (r. 1346–55), earlier king (1331–45), is attested with the title "Emperor of Greece and King of All Serb Lands and the Maritime" in a document dating to between 1347–56 (see also [[Emperor of the Serbs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miklosich|first=Franz|authorlink=Franz Miklosich|title=Monumenta serbica spectantia historiam Serbiae, Bosnae, Ragusii ed: Fr|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=57JJAAAAMAAJ|year=1858|publisher=apud Guilelmum Braumüller|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dušan has been described as a "king-emperor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Evans|title=Great Britain and the Creation of Yugoslavia: Negotiating Balkan Nationality and Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DkBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81|date=30 July 2008|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-307-0|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The German Empire was also ruled by an Emperor-King, as the German [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] [[List of German monarchs|Emperor]] was also [[List of rulers of Prussia|King]] of [[Prussia]].
* The [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s were also Kings of Italy, Germany and Burgundy for most of the time that title existed.
* [[Napoléon I of France|Emperor Napoléon I of the French]] was also [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|King of Italy]]. His title was shortened in "Emperor-King" (''Empereur-Roi'' or ''l'Empereur et Roi'') rather than "King-Emperor".
* [[John VI of Portugal]] was made titular [[Emperor of Brazil]] alongside being [[King of Portugal]] and was titled as King-Emperor until his death. After John VI's death, his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] briefly acceded him as King of Portugal while reigning as Emperor of Brazil.

[[File:Crowd awaiting Crown Prince Tokyo Dec1916.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Throngs before the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] in Japan awaiting the appearance of Crown Prince [[Hirohito]] for the recent proclamation of his official recognition as the [[heir apparent]] to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne|Japanese Imperial Throne]] – ''New York Times,'' 1916.]] 
{{Ranks of Nobility}}
A '''crown prince''' is the male [[heir apparent]] to the [[throne]] in a royal or imperial [[monarchy]]. The female form of the title is '''crown princess''', which may refer either to an heir apparent or, especially in earlier times, to the wife of the person styled crown prince.

''Crown prince'' as a descriptive term has been used throughout history for the prince who is first-in-line to a throne and is expected to succeed (i.e. the heir apparent), barring any unforeseen future event preventing this. In certain monarchies, a more specific [[substantive title]] may be accorded and become associated with the position of ''heir apparent'' (e.g. [[Prince of Wales]] in the [[United Kingdom]]). In these monarchies, the term crown prince may be used less often than the substantive title (or never).

Until the late twentieth century, no modern monarchy adopted a system whereby females would be guaranteed to succeed to the throne (i.e. [[absolute primogeniture]]). A crown princess would therefore be more likely to refer to the [[spouse]] of a crown prince. She would be styled crown princess, not in her [[substantive title|own right]] but by [[courtesy title|courtesy]].

==Description==
The term crown prince is not used in European monarchies wherein the hereditary sovereign holds a title below that of king/queen or emperor/empress (such as [[grand duke]] or [[prince]]), although it is sometimes used as a synonym for heir apparent.

In Europe, where [[primogeniture]] governed succession to all monarchies except those of the [[Pope|Papacy]] and [[Andorra]], the eldest son or (more recently) eldest child of the current monarch fills the role of crown prince or princess, depending upon whether females of the [[dynasty]] enjoy personal [[line of hereditary succession|succession rights]]. Male-precedence has been abolished in [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Also, 15 other Commonwealth realms&lt;/ref&gt; The eldest living child of a monarch is sometimes not the heir apparent or crown prince, because that position can be held by a descendant of a deceased older child who, by "right of representation", inherits the same place in the line of succession that would be held by the ancestor if he or she were still living (for example, [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl Gustaf, Duke of Jämtland]] was the crown prince of Sweden from 1950 to 1973, as the senior grandson by male primogeniture of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]], although the former [[Count Sigvard Bernadotte of Wisborg|Prince Sigvard, Duke of Uppland]] was Gustaf VI Adolf's eldest living son, and [[Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland]] his eldest living [[dynasty|dynastic]] son during those years).

In some monarchies, those of the [[Middle East]] for example, in which primogeniture is not the decisive factor in dynastic succession, a person may not possess the title or status of crown prince by right of birth, but may obtain (and lose) it as a result of an official designation made on some other legal or traditional basis, such as former crown prince [[Prince Hassan bin Talal|Hassan bin Talal]] of [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan|Jordan]].

Compare [[heir apparent]] and [[heir presumptive]]. In Scandinavian kingdoms, the heir presumptive to the crown may hold a different title than the [[heir apparent]]: hereditary prince (German: ''Erbprinz'', French: ''prince héréditaire''). It is also the title borne by the heir apparent of [[Liechtenstein]], as well as the heir apparent or presumptive of [[Monaco]]. In [[Luxembourg]], the heir apparent bears the title of hereditary grand duke (German: ''erbgroßherzog'', Luxembourgish: ''ierfgroussherzog''); along with hereditary prince, it was also the title borne by the heirs apparent to the thrones of the grand duchies, sovereign [[duke|duchies]] and [[prince|principalities]], and of [[mediatized]] princely families in the [[German Empire|German]] [[abolished monarchies|monarchies abolished]] in 1918.

==Christian/Western traditional titles==
Many monarchies use or did use [[Substantive title|substantive titles]] for their heirs apparent, often of historical origin:

*[[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] ([[Ancient Regime|Kingdom of France]])
*[[Duke of Brabant]] ([[Belgium]])
*[[Duke of Braganza]] ([[Kingdom of Portugal]])
*[[Duke of Cornwall]] ([[Kingdom of England]]), currently one of the titles of the Prince of Wales
*[[Duke of Rothesay]] ([[Kingdom of Scotland]]), currently used by the Prince of Wales in place of his Welsh title when in Scotland
*[[Grand Prince of Tuscany|Grand Prince]] ([[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]])
*[[Moravian Margraviate|Margrave of Moravia]] ([[Kingdom of Bohemia]])
*[[Prince of Asturias]] ([[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] &amp; [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]), also used by heir presumptives
*[[Prince of Girona]] ([[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] &amp; Spain)
*[[Prince Imperial of Brazil|Prince Imperial]] ([[Empire of Brazil]], [[Second French Empire]], and [[First Mexican Empire|Empire of Mexico]])
*[[Prince of Orange]] (Netherlands), whether or not the equivalent title is held by the spouse of the titleholder is decided by the Dutch parliament (e.g., [[Queen Máxima of the Netherlands]] was never titled Princess of Orange by marriage for this reason)
*[[Prince of Piedmont]] ([[Kingdom of Sardinia]], and then [[Kingdom of Italy]], when it was alternated with ''Prince of Naples'') once conferred by King [[ Joseph Bonaparte]]                                          
*[[Prince Royal (disambiguation)|Prince Royal]] ([[Kingdom of France|France]] in [[French Revolution|1789–1791]] and the [[July Monarchy]], and Portugal since 1815)
*[[Prince of Turnovo]] ([[Kingdom of Bulgaria]])
*[[Prince of Viana]] ([[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] &amp; Spain)
*Rex iunior ([[Kingdom of Hungary]]), lit. ''junior king'' as he was crowned during the life of the incumbent king
*[[Tsesarevich]] ([[Imperial Russia|Russia]])

Some monarchies have used (although not always ''[[de jure]]'') a territorial title for heirs apparent which, though often perceived as a crown princely title, is not automatically hereditary. It generally requires a specific conferral by the sovereign, which may be withheld.

Current and past titles in this category include:
*[[Caesar (title)#Minor dynastic title|Caesar]] or Kaisar ([[Roman Empire|Roman]] and early [[Byzantine Empire]]s) in honor of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], distinguished from the senior [[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]
*[[Symbasileus]] (late [[Byzantine Empire]]), lit. ''co-emperor'' but still distinguished from the senior who was addressed as [[Autocrator]]
*[[Aetheling]] ([[Anglo-Saxon England]]) and [[edling]] ([[Welsh kingdoms]]), lit. ''of the royal family''
*[[Duke of Estonia]] and Lolland (Denmark; during, at least, reigns of [[Christopher II of Denmark|Christopher II]] and [[Valdemar IV]])
*[[Prince of Norway]] ([[Denmark-Norway]]); in 15th–19th centuries
*[[Duke of Valentinois]], used by several heirs to the [[Principality of Monaco|Monégasque]] throne
*[[Prince of Wales]] (England, Great Britain, United Kingdom)
*[[King of the Romans]] ([[Holy Roman Empire]]) – an elective, rather than an inherited title, for the designated successor—usually the son, but sometimes the brother—of the Emperor
*[[King of the Romans|King of Rome]] ([[First French Empire]])
*[[Duke of Sparta]] ([[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]]); used briefly, ''within'' Greece, only by [[Constantine I of Greece|Prince Constantine]], during the reign of his father King [[George I of Greece|George I]]
*[[Marquess of Baux]], used by several heirs to the [[Principality of Monaco|Monégasque]] throne
*[[Prince of Brazil]] (title of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] heir from 1645 to 1815)
*Duke of Scania (Sweden during the time when [[Magnus IV of Sweden]] also was King of [[Terra Scania]])
*Prince of Ani ([[Kingdom of West Armenia]])
*Prince of [[Alba Iulia]] ([[Kingdom of Romania]])
*Grand Voivode of Grahovo ([[Kingdom of Montenegro]])
*Prince of Venice (see [[Prince Eugène de Beauharnais]]); for the heir presumptive to [[Napoleon I]] in his Kingdom of Italy
*[[Duke of Calabria]] ([[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]); prior to the accession of  [[Robert, King of Naples|King Robert]] the title of the Neapolitan heir was [[List of Princes of Salerno|Prince of Salerno]]

==Other specific traditions==
[[Egypt]], ''[[Prince of the Sa'id]]'', meaning ''Prince of Upper Egypt''

[[Persia (Iran)]], [[Pahlavi dynasty]] and [[Qajar dynasty]], the full style was ''Vala Hazrat-i-Humayun [[Vali Ahd]], [[Shahzad (disambiguation)|Shahzad]]a'' (given name)'', (in Persian: والاحضرت همایون ولایتعهد) i.e. His August Imperial Highness the Heir Apparent, Prince ...;
*the above component '''vali ahd''' (or Velayat Ahd) meaning 'successor by virtue of a covenant' (or various forms and etymological derivations) was adopted by many [[oriental]] monarchies, even some non-Muslim, e.g. '''Walet''' as alternative title for the [[Nepal]]i (Hindu) royal heir apparent; first used Crown Prince [[Trailokya]] in the middle of the nineteenth century, taken from the Mughal title 'Vali Ahd'

[[Hindu]] tradition (Indian subcontinent):
*[[Yuvaraja]] was part of the full title in many princely states of India, e.g.
**in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], the heir apparent was styled ''Maharaj Kumar Shri Yuvaraj'' (personal name) ''Singhji Bahadur''
*Tika
*[[Nepal]], where the King was styled [[Maharajadhiraja]]:
**the heir apparent was styled: ''[[Sri]] Sri Sri Sri Sri'' '''Yuvarajadhiraj''' ('Young King of Kings', i.e. Crown Prince) (personal name) ''Bir Bikram Shah Deva'';
**the eldest son of the heir apparent was styled: ''Sri Sri Sri Sri Sri '''Nava Yuvaraj''''' ('Young Crown Prince') (personal name) ''Bir Bikram Shah Deva''

East Asian traditions:
*The cognates of Chinese ''Huang [[Taizi]]'' (皇太子, "Great Imperial Son") – if a son of the reigning emperor,  and ''Huang Taisun'' (皇太孫, Great Imperial Grandson) – if a grandson of the emperor:

{| class="wikitable"

!&lt;small&gt;''if the heir apparent is a:&lt;/small&gt; !! son !! grandson
|-
| Chinese || Huang [[Taizi]] || Huang Taisun
|-
| Japanese || [[Kōtaishi]] || Kōtaison
|-
| Korean || Hwangtaeja (황태자) || Hwangtaeson (황태손)
|-
| Vietnamese || Hoàng Thái Tử || Hoàng Thái Tôn
|}

*During the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in [[Korea]], the crown prince was referred as Dong-gung(동궁, 東宮, 'East Palace') due to the location of his residence from the main palace; or wangseja (王世子 왕세자). He was not necessarily the first-born son, wonja (元子 원자).

Southeast Asian traditions: 
*[[Siam Makutrajakuman]] (สยามมกุฎราชกุมาร) in [[Thailand]] since 1886.
*[[Krom Phrarajawangboworn Sathanmongkol]] or Phra Maha [[Uparaja]] or commonly called Wang Na (or [[Front Palace]]) in [[Thailand]] prior to 1886.

'''King''', or '''king regnant''', is the title given to a male [[monarch]] in a variety of contexts. The female equivalent is [[queen regnant]],&lt;ref&gt;There have been rare exceptions, most notably [[Jadwiga of Poland]] and [[Mary, Queen of Hungary]], who were crowned as King of Poland and King of Hungary respectively during the 1380s.&lt;/ref&gt; while the title of queen on its own usually refers to the [[queen consort|consort]] of a king. 

*In the context of prehistory, antiquity and contemporary indigenous peoples, the title may refer to [[tribal kingship]]. Germanic kingship is cognate with [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] traditions of tribal rulership (c.f. Indic ''[[rājan]]'', Gothic ''[[reiks]]'', and Old Irish ''[[rí]]'', etc.).
*In the context of classical antiquity, king may translate in Latin as ''[[rex (king)|rex]]'' and in Greek as ''[[archon]]'' or ''[[basileus]]''.
*In classical European [[feudalism]], the title of ''king'' as the ruler of a ''kingdom'' is understood to be the highest rank in the feudal order, potentially subject, at least nominally, only to an [[emperor]] (harking back to the [[List of Roman client kings|client kings]] of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]]).&lt;ref&gt;The notion of a king being below an emperor in the feudal order, just as a [[duke]] is the rank below a king, is more theoretical than historical. The only kingdom title held within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], with the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy/Arles]] being nominal realms. The titles of [[King of the Germans]] and [[King of the Romans]] were non-landed titles held by the Emperor-elect (sometimes during the lifetime of the previous Emperor, sometimes not), although there were anti-Kings at various points; Arles and Italy were either held directly by the Emperor or not at all.

The [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empires]] technically contained various kingdoms ([[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816–49)|Illyria]], [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Lombardy–Venetia]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia and Lodomeria]], as well as the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Slavonia|Slavonia]] which were themselves subordinate titles to the Hungarian Kingdom and which were merged as [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]] in 1868), but the emperor and the respective kings were the same person. The [[Russian Empire]] did not include any kingdoms. The short-lived [[First French Empire]] (1804–1814/5) included a number of [[client state|client]] kingdoms under [[Napoleon I]], such as the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], the [[Kingdom of Etruria]], the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]], the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] and the [[Kingdom of Holland]]. The [[German Empire]] (1871-1918) included the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], Bavaria, Württemberg and Saxony, with the Prussian king also holding the Imperial title.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a modern context, the title may refer to the ruler of one of a number of modern monarchies (either absolute or constitutional). The title of ''king'' is used alongside other titles for monarchs: in the West, [[emperor]], [[grand prince]], [[prince]], [[archduke]], [[duke]] or [[grand duke]], and in the Islamic world, [[malik]], [[sultan]], [[emir]] or [[Hakim (title)|hakim]], etc.&lt;ref name="pine"&gt;{{cite book | title=Titles: How the King became His Majesty | publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble | authorlink=L.G. Pine | last=Pine | first=L.G. | year=1992 | location=New York | page=[https://archive.org/details/titleshowkingbec0000pine/page/86 86] | isbn=978-1-56619-085-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/titleshowkingbec0000pine/page/86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''king'' may also refer to a [[king consort]], a title that is sometimes given to the husband of a [[Queen regnant|ruling queen]], but the title of [[prince consort]] is sometimes granted instead.

==Etymology==
{{see|Rex (title)|Knyaz}}
{{Wiktionary|cyning}}
The English term {{wikt-lang|en|king}} is derived from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''cyning'', which in turn is derived from the [[Common Germanic]] *''kuningaz''. The Common Germanic term was borrowed into Estonian and Finnish at an early time, surviving in these languages as {{wikt-lang|fi|kuningas}}.
The English term "King" translates, and is considered equivalent to, Latin ''[[Rex (title)|rēx]]'' and its equivalents in the various [[European languages]]. The Germanic term is notably different from the word for "King" in other Indo-European languages (''*rēks'' "ruler"; [[Latin]] ''[[King of Rome|rēx]]'', [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''[[Raja|rājan]]'' and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[rí]]g'', but see Gothic ''[[reiks]]'' and, e.g., modern German ''Reich'' and modern Dutch ''rijk''). It is a derivation from the term ''*kunjom'' "kin" ([[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|cynn}}) by the ''-inga-'' suffix. The literal meaning is that of a "scion of the [noble] kin", or perhaps "son or descendant of one of noble birth" ([[OED]]).

==History==
The English word is of Germanic origin, and historically refers to [[Germanic kingship]], in the pre-Christian period a type of [[tribal kingship]]. The [[monarchies of Europe]] in the Christian [[Middle Ages]] derived their claim from [[Christianisation]] and the  [[divine right of kings]], partly influenced by the notion of [[Germanic king|sacral kingship]] inherited from  [[Germanic antiquity]].

The [[Early Middle Ages]] begin with a fragmentation of the former [[Western Roman Empire]] into [[barbarian kingdoms]]. In Western Europe, the kingdom of the [[Franks]] developed into the [[Carolingian Empire]] by the 8th century, and the [[Heptarchy|kingdoms]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England]] were unified into the [[kingdom of England]] by the 10th century.

With the breakup of the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century, the system of [[feudalism]] places kings at the head of a pyramid of relationships between liege lords and vassals, dependent on the regional rule of [[baron]]s, and the intermediate positions of [[counts]] (or [[earl]]s) and [[duke]]s. The core of European feudal [[manorialism]] in the [[High Middle Ages]] were the territories of the former [[Carolingian Empire]], i.e. the [[kingdom of France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (centered on the nominal kingdoms of [[kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;

In the course of the European Middle Ages, the [[Monarchies in Europe|European kingdoms]] underwent a general trend of centralisation of power, so that by the [[Late Middle Ages]] there were a number of large and powerful kingdoms in Europe, which would develop into the [[great power]]s of Europe in the [[Early Modern period]].
*In the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the remnants  of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], the petty kingdoms of [[kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] and [[Kingdom of Pamplona|Pamplona]], expanded into the [[kingdom of Portugal]], the [[Crown of Castile]] and the [[Crown of Aragon]] with the ongoing [[Reconquista]].
*In [[southern Europe]], the [[kingdom of Sicily]] was established following the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]]. The [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] was claimed as a separate title held by the [[Crown of Aragon]]  in 1324. In the Balkans, the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom of Serbia]] was established in 1217.
*In eastern-[[central Europe]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was established [[Europe in AD 1000|in AD 1000]] following the Christianisation of the [[Magyars]]. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] were established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1025 and 1198, respectively. In Eastern Europe, the [[Kievan Rus']] consolidated into the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], which did not technically claim the status of kingdom until the early modern [[Tsardom of Russia]].
*In [[northern Europe]], the tribal kingdoms of the [[Viking Age]] by the 11th century expanded into the [[North Sea Empire]] under [[Cnut the Great]],  king of Denmark, England and Norway. The [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] resulted in "consolidated" kingdoms of [[Consolidation of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Norwegian expansion during the Middle Ages|Norway]], and by the end of the medieval period the pan-Scandinavian [[Kalmar Union]].

{{Monarchism}}
Currently ({{as of|2016|lc=y}}),&lt;!--but note death of [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] in October 2016--&gt; fifteen kings are recognized as the heads of state of [[sovereign state]]s (i.e. English ''king'' is used as official translation of the respective native titles held by the monarchs).

Most of these are heads of state of [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]]; kings ruling over [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] are the [[King of Saudi Arabia]], the [[King of Bahrain]] and the [[King of Eswatini]].&lt;ref&gt; The distinction of the title of "king" from "sultan" or "emir" in oriental monarchies is largely stylistics; the  [[Sultanate of Oman]], the [[State of Qatar]], the [[State of Kuwait]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] are also categorised as absolute monarchies.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NY money train Oct 09.JPG|thumb|A money train car at the [[New York Transit Museum]]. The car was used by the [[New York City Subway]] until 2006.]]
[[File: NYCS Work Train Interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of the same car]]

A '''money train''' is one or more [[railcar]]s used to collect [[Fare control|fare collection]] revenue from stations on a [[Rapid transit|subway]] system and return it to a central location for processing. This train is typically used to carry [[money bag]]s guarded by [[transit police]] to deter robberies.

On the [[New York City Subway]], a “money train” was first mentioned in 1905, a year after the system opened.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Vandam |title=Cash and Carry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/nyregion/thecity/31mone.html?ex=157680000&amp;en=7f9eb6f4d0f34db4&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 31, 2006 |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their trains were converted from subway cars that have been removed from service. This has since been discontinued, with the last service running in January 2006.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; Two of the cars went to the [[New York Transit Museum]] in Brooklyn.

The use of a train was necessary because of difficulties in getting to and from stations using over-street transport, and because, since the subway reaches every station, the rail system itself can be used to collect money from [[ticket machine]]s. The 1995 American [[crime]] thriller film ''[[Money Train]]'' depicts a robbery of such a train.

Singapore's [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] system introduced a four-car money train when the system was commissioned in 1987. Used to transfer cash trolleys from stations to a counting facility at Bishan Depot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fare Payment Evolution: Interview|url=http://movingstories.smrt.com.sg/www/interview---tan-pang-chew.html|website=Moving Stories|publisher=SMRT|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806192643/http://movingstories.smrt.com.sg/www/interview---tan-pang-chew.html|archive-date=6 August 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; the increased use of stored value tickets resulted in the train being decommissioned in 2007.

==Pay car==
{{main|Pay car}}
In Australia, the reverse procedure occurred with the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] fleet of '''pay buses'''. A small self powered railcar, they were used to deliver [[pay slip|pay packets]] containing cash to employees at remote railway stations, as well as maintenance gangs working on the tracks. This operation remained in service until the 1980s when it was supplanted by electronic payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhprojects/cashontrack/rail2paybus.htm |title=Ca$h On Track, The Story of the Rail Pay Bus |work=NSW Rail Heritage |publisher=www.nswrailheritage.com.au |accessdate=January 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208230004/http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhprojects/cashontrack/rail2paybus.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unit trains enable railways to compete more effectively with road and internal waterway transport systems. Time and money is saved by avoiding the complexities and delays that would otherwise be involved with assembling and disassembling trains at [[rail yard]]s near the origin and destination. Unit trains are particularly efficient and economical for high-volume [[commodity|commodities]]. Since they often carry only one commodity, cars are of all the same type; often the cars are identical.

== Use ==
Unit trains are typically used for the transportation of bulk goods. These can be solid substances such as:
* [[Track ballast]] or [[gravel]]
* [[Iron ore]] from mines to [[sea ports|ports]] or [[steel mills]]
* [[Coal]] from [[coal mines|mines]] to [[power stations]]
* [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] from [[coking plant]]s to [[steel mill]]s
* [[Steel]]

Bulk liquids are transported in unit trains made up of [[tank car]]s, such as:
* [[Crude oil]] from oil fields to refineries (can be [{{convert|60000|oilbbl|m3}}] of oil in a unit train of 100 tank cars)&lt;ref name="union_pacific_oil_train"&gt;{{Cite web

A '''drag freight''' is a long, slow, high-tonnage [[Rail transport|railroad]] train, often carrying commodities such as [[coal]] or [[ore]]. Compared to "fast freight" trains, drag freight trains have a very low power-to-weight ratio, making them somewhat unpredictable on steep grades or hilly routes. This causes many dispatchers to be extremely conservative with how they handle drag freights, especially when they share lines with higher priority fast freights and passenger trains.

== Power ==

Before and during WWI and into the 1920s, large locomotives such as the 2-8-2 Mikado were typically used for drag freight operations.

After the railroads dieselized, heavy duty diesel locomotives (typically six-axle units, to improve [[adhesion]]) were used for the drag freights.  [[Multiple unit]] operations allowed one person to control multiple locomotives. As many as 4-11 locomotives may be used for a heavy haul drag freight. Attempts were made to develop ultra large locomotives for this purpose, for example the Union Pacific [[DDA40X]] and [[gas-turbine]] locomotives.

When AC traction motors and [[thyristor]] [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]]s became available, locomotives such as [[EMD SD70MAC]] and the [[GE AC4400CW]] replaced the older [[EMD SD40]] on a three-for-two basis.

==United Kingdom==
In the UK, such trains were called mineral trains and the locomotives that hauled them were called mineral locomotives. An example of a mineral locomotive was the [[LNWR 17in Coal Engine]].

The trains were [[Railway coupling|loose-coupled]], had no [[Brake (railway)|continuous brakes]], and were speed-limited to {{convert|25|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lack of brake power was a potential hazard and, when approaching a downhill gradient, it was necessary to stop the train and "pin down" the handbrakes on some of the wagons before proceeding.

Today, [[British Rail Class 60|Class 60]] and [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66]] locomotives owned by the [[DB Cargo UK]] and [[Freightliner Group#United Kingdom|Freightliner Heavy Haul]] are used for drag freights. Also, [[British Rail Class 59|Class 59]] locomotives owned by National Power, Foster Yeoman, and other large bulk shippers were used on the heavy freights in the 1990s. Because of coupling limits, only single units were used.

[[Image:LincolnTrain.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Abraham Lincoln]]'s funeral train.]]
A '''funeral train''' carries a [[coffin]] or coffins (caskets) to a place of interment. Funeral trains today are often reserved for leaders, national heroes, or government officials, as part of a [[state funeral]], but in the past were sometimes the chief means of transporting coffins and mourners to [[cemetery|graveyards]]. Many modern era funeral trains are hauled by operationally restored [[steam locomotive]]s, due to the more romantic image of the steam train against more modern [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] or [[electric locomotive]]s, however non-steam powered funeral trains have grown in popularity in recent years, with notable examples being the 1968 funeral of [[Robert F. Kennedy]], hauled by two [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] [[PRR GG1|GG1]] electrics, or the funeral train of [[George H.W. Bush]] in 2018, with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] sponsoring the event, and his train was led by [[Union Pacific 4141]], an [[EMD SD70 series|EMD SD70ACe]] diesel locomotive that had been previously painted in a "George Bush 41" scheme in the style of [[Air Force One]], and dedicated to Bush with him and [[Barbara Bush|Barbara]] touring the locomotive unit at its unveiling ceremony in 2005.

==History==
[[File:Brookwood Coffin Ticket.jpg|thumb|Third class coffin ticket, issued between April–September 1925.{{sfn|Clarke|2006|p=162}}|alt=Railway ticket labelled "Southern Railways London Necropolis Coffin Ticket, Waterloo to Brookwood, Third Class]]
The first funeral train was run by [[London Necropolis Company|The London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company]] on 7 November 1854. Trains ran once a day from [[London Necropolis railway station]] to [[Brookwood Cemetery]]. The train carried not only the bodies of the dead, but the parties of mourners who had come to attend the [[funeral]] services. Different classes were available for both the living and the dead; a more expensive [[first class travel|first class]] ticket would provide a more ornate coffin and greater care of the body during transit. The [[London Necropolis Railway]] was run on the tracks of the [[London and South Western Railway]], who feared that regular passengers would shun locomotives which had previously hauled funeral trains, and therefore purchased an entirely new fleet exclusively for the Necropolis line. The public were initially reserved about the project; one bishop expressed fears that "It may sometimes happen that persons of opposite characters might be carried in the same conveyance. For instance, the body of some profligate spendthrift might be placed in a conveyance with the body of some respectable member of the church, which would shock the feelings of his friends".&lt;ref name="Fortean"&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/179_deathline.shtml The Deathline] - ''[[Fortean Times]]'' (Registration required). URL accessed 11 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Others felt that the railway industry, which was less than 20 years old and still very much a new technology, was too hectic and loud, ill-befitting the sombre mourning associated with [[Christian burial|Christian funeral]] services.

The line ran daily &amp;ndash; including Sundays &amp;ndash; for almost 50 years until 1900, when the Sunday service was stopped and trains began to run on an "as needed basis". The railway remained in operation through the [[World War I|First World War]] and [[World War II|Second World War]] until 16 April 1941, when the London Necropolis station was bombed in the [[London Blitz]]. The station was never rebuilt and the line fell into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbcs.org.uk/railway.htm The Cemetery Railway] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011060751/http://www.tbcs.org.uk/railway.htm |date=11 October 2006 }}. URL accessed 11 November&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[West Norwood railway station]] opened two years later it was sited near to the gates of [[West Norwood Cemetery|South London Metropolitan Cemetery]], founded twenty years earlier; pall-bearers would unload the coffin from its "Funeral special" and simply carry it from the side entrance to the main gates. While this practice is long discontinued, the side gates still remain.

Following the [[Transport Act 1947|1947 nationalisation of Britain's railways]], the use of the railway to transport coffins went into steep decline. New operating procedures required that coffins be carried in a separate carriage from other cargo; as regular services to Brookwood station used [[electric multiple unit]] trains which did not have goods vans, coffins for Brookwood had to be shipped to [[Woking]] and then carried by road for the last part of the journey, or a special train had to be chartered. The last railway funeral to be carried by British Rail anywhere was that of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] in September 1979,&lt;ref name=bnr1&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=John M. |title=The Brookwood Necropolis Railway |id=Locomotion Papers no. 143 |year=2006 |edition=4th |publisher=The Oakwood Press |page=178 |isbn=978-0-85361-655-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 28 March 1988 British Rail formally ceased to carry coffins altogether.&lt;ref name=bnr2&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brookwood Necropolis Railway|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Mountbatten, the only railway funeral to be held in the United Kingdom has been that of former [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers]] General Secretary [[Jimmy Knapp]], carried from London to [[Kilmarnock]] for burial in August 2001.&lt;ref name=bnr3&gt;{{cite book|title=The London Necropolis Railway|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
[[Image:Haslem's Creek Cemetery Station c1865.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cemetery Station No. 1 railway station]], [[Rookwood Cemetery]] [[Australia]]]]
In [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], there was a similar service whereby the [[Rookwood Cemetery railway line]] served the [[Rookwood Cemetery]] complex. From 1867 until 1948 trains would depart [[Regent Street railway station|Mortuary Station]] in Sydney City and travel the 15&amp;nbsp;km to Rookwood Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityrail.info/aboutus/station_tour/location_2.jsp  CityRail, Welcome to Central Station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924235113/http://www.cityrail.info/aboutus/station_tour/location_2.jsp |date=2006-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Melbourne]] funeral services operated to the [[Springvale Botanical Cemetery|Springvale Necropolis]] along the dedicated [[Spring Vale Cemetery railway line|Spring Vale Cemetery railway]],&lt;ref&gt;

==Finland==
In [[Helsinki]], a 2&amp;nbsp;km long side track ran from the [[Malmi, Helsinki|Malmi]] railroad station to the [[Malmi cemetery]], which had its own railroad station. Coffins were transported to the cemetery from Harju morgue in [[Kallio]]. The track was decommissioned in 1954, and has been removed, but the Malmi cemetery station building still exists.

== Germany ==
The Berlin [[Friedhofsbahn]] (Cemetery Line), opened in 1913, ran from [[Berlin-Wannsee station]] to [[Stahnsdorf]]'s Forest Cemetery, about 20 kilometres southwest of Central Berlin. It was serviced by both funeral trains with passenger and hearse carriages, as well as regular S-Bahn (suburban rail) services. Funeral train service ended in 1952 and the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 spelled the end for cross-border S-Bahn services.

==State funerals==

[[File:Clapham Junction Sir Winston Churchill's Funeral Train geograph-2675150-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Winston Churchill's funeral train passing Clapham Junction]]
Although most funeral services now make use of road-going [[hearse]]s rather than trains, funeral trains remain common for the funerals of [[head of state|heads of state]].

'''UK:''' All British monarchs since [[Queen Victoria]] have been carried by funeral trains; King [[Edward VII]] and King [[George VI]] were both taken to the [[Windsor &amp; Eton Central railway station]] for the funeral procession. Most [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Ministers]] do not receive funeral trains. However, as part of his state funeral, [[Winston Churchill]]'s coffin was carried by a special train hauled by the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] [[Battle of Britain class|"Battle of Britain" class]] locomotive ''Winston Churchill'' from [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo]] to {{stnlnk|Handborough}}, the closest station both to [[St Martin's Church, Bladon]], where Churchill was buried, and to [[Blenheim Palace]].

'''Russia: ''' In 1894, the body of [[Tsar Alexander III]], was transported by train from [[Livadia Palace]] in the Crimea, back St. Petersburg, by way of Moscow. On 23 January 1924, the body of [[Vladimir Lenin]] was carried by funeral train to [[Moscow Paveletskaya railway station]]. Later Museum of Lenin Funeral train was established in the rail terminal building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruzgd.ru/U_127.shtml Мемориальный паровоз У-127] {{in lang|ru}}.

[[File:The Lincoln Funeral Train, Philadelphia MET DP254768.jpg|thumb|Abraham Lincoln's funeral train in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1865]]
In the '''USA''' Presidents are also sometimes transported by train; [[Abraham Lincoln]] (April 1865), [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1945), and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1969) were all given funeral trains as part of the procession. More recently, Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] of New Jersey, an advocate of public transit and [[Amtrak]], was transported from New Jersey to Washington on the [[Northeast Corridor]] following his death in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video-embed.nj.com/services/player/bcpid1949044328001?bctid=2437077512001&amp;bckey=AQ~~,AAAAPLMIP6E~,BRrRHTAljlHRdo2SPuH4cYpjTxdIZDlA NJ.com].

Bush]]'s funeral train (December 2018) carried him from [[Westfield, Texas]] to the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] in [[College Station, Texas]], where he was buried. [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] selected [[Union Pacific 4141|4141]] and 9096 to do the honors of transporting President Bush to his final resting place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Bush Funeral|publisher=ABC News|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/schedule-george-hw-bushs-funeral-includes-trip-capitol/story?id=59555460|accessdate=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian''' Prime Minister Sir [[John Alexander Macdonald]] ([[Canadian Pacific Railway]]), [[John George Diefenbaker]] and [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]] ([[Via Rail]]) had their bodies transported by train.

Founder of the '''Republic of Turkey''' [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s coffin was transported to the capital [[Ankara]] by a funeral train from [[İzmit]] where it was brought to on the battlecruiser Yavuz, ex [[SMS Goeben]].

The last times a funeral train was used at a state funeral in '''Denmark''' were on 24 January 1972, when King [[Frederik IX of Denmark]] was taken from [[Christiansborg Palace Chapel]] via [[Copenhagen Central Station]] to [[Roskilde Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bt.dk/nyheder/kongens-doed-og-bisaettelse-i-1972 |title=Kongens død og bisættelse i 1972 |newspaper=[[BT (tabloid)|BT]] |author=''[[Ritzau]]'' |language=Danish |date=8 September 2012 |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 14 November 2000, when his widow [[Queen Ingrid]] was taken along the same route. Queen Ingrid's funeral, including the train transfer with a steam engine, is documented in a lengthy report by Danish television and available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/bonanza/serie/440/begravelse-dronning-ingrid/66116/den-sidste-rejse-dronning-ingrids-begravelse-16 Queen Ingrid's Funeral: The Last Journey], 6 part video report, Danmarks Radio (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dinner train''' is a relatively new type of [[tourist train]] service whose main purpose is to allow people to eat dinner while experiencing a relatively short, leisurely round trip train ride. This contrasts with conventional passenger trains, whose main purpose is to transport passengers to some destination as quickly as possible but which also might serve dinner on long-distance routes.  
[[Image:blissfield township dinner train.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[http://www.murdermysterytrain.com/ The Old Road] dinner train, [[Blissfield, Michigan]]]]

Dinner trains have become popular in recent years,{{when|date=April 2013}} particularly in the [[United States]]. This is in part a result of a nostalgia for passenger trains (which are less common in the U.S. than in many other countries) and in part because it provides a very different experience from driving and from eating at ordinary restaurants.

The first dinner train in the United States was the "Supper Chief" that ran on the [[Sierra Railroad]] in California in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Porterfield2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=James D. Porterfield|title=From the Dining Car: The Recipes and Stories Behind Today's Greatest Rail Dining Experiences|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312242015|url-access=registration|date=1 November 2004|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-24201-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312242015/page/125 125]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dinner train service was renewed in 1999 with the Sierra Railroad Dinner Train.

There are over 80 dinner trains currently{{when|date=April 2013}} operating in North America.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Most such trains operate either seasonally or a few days a week, but some operate daily (or even twice daily on weekends in a few cases).

Almost all dinner trains run on lightly used branch lines or tourist lines,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and virtually all use older passenger cars. Almost all dinner train trips are characterized by 2–4 hour trips that return to where they started since the emphasis is the experience and not traveling to a destination.  Some feature the use of [[steam locomotives]] for at least some of their runs. Speeds are usually between {{convert|10|–|25|mph}}, much slower than ordinary passenger trains, not only due to lower [[Rail tracks|track]] standards but also to the fact that the emphasis is on the journey itself, not the destination.

Dinner trains can be fun not only for the passengers who ride them but also for the train crews and other employees.{{POV statement|date=April 2014}} They can also provide jobs and be a profitable business. Moreover, they can generate substantial benefits for local economies, including boosting tourism and increasing sales at nearby businesses.{{POV statement|date=April 2014}} For example, the [[Spirit of Washington Dinner Train|''Spirit of Washington'']], which operated daily on the [[Woodinville Subdivision]] near Seattle, provided 80 full-time jobs and contributed roughly $10 million annually to the local economy before ceasing operations in late October 2007.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} There was also the [[Michigan Star Clipper Dinner Train]] which was a dinner train that operated for 24 years out of [[Walled Lake, Michigan]], with trips heading from [[West Bloomfield, Michigan|West Bloomfield]] to [[Wixom, Michigan|Wixom]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In addition to just providing dinner while riding on a scenic route, some dinner trains have developed additional functions, such as hosting wedding receptions, reunions, company retreats, [[murder mystery]] events during the dinner.

Some so-called ''dinner trains'' do not actually serve meals aboard the train. Rather, the food is served in a building or outdoors after the train has reached its destination; the passengers then reboard for the return trip. This is particularly true for narrow gauge railways, on which it would be impractical to prepare and serve formal meals. Examples include the {{convert|2|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} gauge [[Puffing Billy Railway]] near [[Melbourne, Australia]] and the 3 ft (914 mm) gauge [[Lahaina Kaanapali Railroad]] in [[Maui, Hawaii]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Wessex Trains 153302 at Bristol Temple Meads 2005-12-07 03.jpg|thumb|Wessex Trains 153302]]
[[File:Vestibule2.jpg|thumb|[[Budd Company|Budd]] [[Amfleet|Amfleet I]] vestibule|alt=]]
A '''vestibuled train''' is a [[passenger train]] whose [[Passenger car (rail)|cars]] have enclosed [[Vestibule (architecture)#Railroad use|vestibules]] at their ends, in contrast to the open platforms on early cars. Typically, a vestibule has doorways on either side to allow passenger entry and egress at stations, a door into the body of the car, and, at the car end, a doorway to allow access to the next car through a flexible [[gangway connection]].

The first vestibuled train was introduced on June 15, 1887, on the inaugural run of the ''Pennsylvania Limited'' of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], forerunner of the famous ''[[Broadway Limited]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Some Classic Trains'', Arthur D. Dubin, Kalmbach Publications, 1964, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

The railway car vestibule as a concept had been tried in various primitive forms during the latter part of the 19th century, but the first viable form was invented by H. H. Sessions and his staff at the [[Pullman Company|Pullman]] Car Works in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;''Some Classic Trains'', Arthur D. Dubin, Kalmbach Publications, 1964, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Sessions' patent was challenged by others and reduced in litigation to the spring mechanism of his vestibule design.  Further litigation by Pullman was successful in modifying the earlier rulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{White-Passenger-1985|volume=2|page=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the development of vestibules, passage between cars when a train was underway was both dangerous&amp;mdash;stepping over a shifting plate between swaying cars with nothing on either side but chain guard rails&amp;mdash;and unpleasant, due to being exposed to the weather, as well as [[soot]], [[ember|red-hot cinders]] and [[fly ash]] raining down from the exhaust of the [[steam locomotive]] hauling the train. As passengers were mostly confined to a single car during the trip, trains had regular meal stops built into their schedules, and sleeping cars were uncommon. The introduction of the vestibuled train in the late nineteenth century led to dining cars, lounge cars, and other specialized cars.&lt;ref name="Douglas, p. 219"&gt;Douglas, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During the 1880s and 1890s, the slogan "Vestibuled Train" was a magic term to railroad publicity departments everywhere. More importantly, this development brought into existence the "train" in the sense we know it today — no longer a series of cars coupled together and pulling together, but a continuous unit for human uses. ... A whole new way of thinking about rail travel developed. You could eat and sleep on trains and [arrive] in a fraction of the previous time.&lt;ref name="Douglas, p. 219"/&gt;}}

Vestibuled cars allowed the development of luxury trains during the golden age of rail travel, trains like the [[Union Pacific]]'s [[Overland Flyer|Overland Limited]] (1890), the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s ''Pennsylvania Limited'' (later renamed the ''Pennsylvania Special'', then the ''Broadway Limited''), and the [[New York Central]]'s [[20th Century Limited]] (1902). The [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern]]'s [[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent]] was introduced in 1891 as the ''Washington and Southwestern Vestibuled Limited,'' and widely known as ''The Vestibule'' because it was the first all-year train south of Washington with vestibuled equipment.

Today, vestibuled trains are standard on nearly all major passenger railroads.

'''Hydrail''' is the generic (not capitalized) adjective term describing all forms of [[rail vehicle]]s, large or small, which use on-board [[hydrogen fuel]] as a source of [[energy]] to power the [[traction motors]], or the [[auxiliary power unit|auxiliaries]], or both. Hydrail [[vehicles]] use the chemical energy of [[hydrogen]] for propulsion, either by burning hydrogen in a [[hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle|hydrogen internal combustion engine]], or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a [[fuel cell]] to run [[electric motors]]. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling [[rail transportation]] is a basic element of the proposed [[hydrogen economy]]. The term is used extensively by research scholars and technicians around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Graham-Rowe | first1 = D. | title = Do the locomotion | doi = 10.1038/4541036a | journal = Nature | volume = 454 | issue = 7208 | pages = 1036–7 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18756218| pmc = | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Minkel | first1 = J.

Hydrail vehicles are usually [[hybrid vehicles]] with renewable [[energy storage]], such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] or [[super capacitor]]s, for [[regenerative braking]], improving efficiency and lowering the amount of hydrogen storage required. Potential hydrail applications include all types of [[rail transport]]: [[commuter rail]];  [[passenger rail]];  [[freight rail]]; [[light rail]]; rail [[rapid transit]]; [[mine railways]]; [[industrial railway]] systems; [[trams]]; and special rail rides at parks and museums.

The term hydrail was first mentioned on August 22, 2003, in an invited presentation at the US Department of Transportation's Volpe Transportations Systems Center in Cambridge, MA. There, Stan Thompson, a former futurist and strategic planner at US telecoms company [[AT&amp;T]] gave a presentation entitled the Mooresville Hydrail Initiative.&lt;ref name = "rai tech 16"&gt;Grey, Eva. [https://www.railway-technology.com/features/featuregerman-state-thrusts-hydrogen-powered-hydrail-into-the-spotlight-4928956/ "German state thrusts hydrogen-powered hydrail into the spotlight."] ''railway-technology.com'', 21 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to authors Stan Thompson and Jim Bowman, the term first appeared in print on 17 February 2004 in the [[International Journal of Hydrogen Energy]] as a search engine target word to enable scholars and technicians around the world  working in the hydrogen rail area to more easily publish and locate all work produced within the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Thompson and Jim Bowman (2004) "The Mooresville Hydrail Initiative", ''[[International Journal of Hydrogen Energy]]'' '''29'''(4): 438, in "News and Views" (a non-peer-reviewed section)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, annual International Hydrail Conferences have been held. Organised by [[Appalachian State University and the Mooresville South Iredell Chamber of Commerce]] in conjunction with universities and other entities, the Conferences have the aim of bringing together scientists, engineers, business leaders, industrial experts, and operators working or using the technology around the world in order to expedite deployment of the technology for environmental, climate, energy security and economic development reasons. Presenters at these conferences have included national and state/provincial agencies from the US, Austria, Canada, China, Denmark, the EU, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United Nations (UNIDO-ICHET).{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In its early years, these conferences were largely dominated by academic fields; however, by 2013, an increasing number of businesses and industrial figures have reportedly been in attendance.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"&gt;[https://www.railengineer.uk/2018/01/05/hydrail-comes-of-age/ "Hydrail comes of age."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110174254/https://www.railengineer.uk/2018/01/05/hydrail-comes-of-age/ |date=2018-01-10 }} ''railengineer.uk'', 5 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010s, both fuel cells and hydrogen generation equipment have been taken up by several transport operators across various countries, such as [[China]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. Many of the same technologies that can be applied to hydrail vehicles can be applied to other forms of transport as well, such as road vehicles.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "rai tech 16"/&gt;

==Technology==
{{see also|hydrogen|fuel cell}}
Hydrogen is a common and easy to find [[Chemical element|element]], being that each molecule of [[water]] has two [[atom]]s of hydrogen for every [[oxygen]] atom present.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; Hydrogen can be separated from water via several means, including [[steam methane reforming|steam reforming]] (normally involving the use of [[fossil fuel]]s) and electrolysis (which requires large amounts of [[electricity]]). Once isolated, hydrogen can serve as a form of fuel.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; It has been proposed that hydrogen for fuelling hydrail vehicles can be produced in individual maintenance depots, requiring only a steady supply of electricity and water; it can then be pumped into pressurised tanks upon the vehicle.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;

The development of lighter and more capable fuel cells has increased the viability of hydrogen-powered vehicles. According to Canadian company Hydrogenics, in 2001, its 25&amp;nbsp;kW fuel cell weighed 290&amp;nbsp;kg and had an efficiency ranging between 38 and 45 per cent; however, by 2017, they were producing more powerful and compact fuel cells weighing 72&amp;nbsp;kg and with an efficiency between 48 and 55 per cent, a roughly fivefold increase in power density.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; According to Rail Engineer, the use of hydrogen propulsion on certain types of trains, such as freight locomotives or high-speed trains, is less attractive and more challenging than on lower-powered applications, such as shunting locomotives and multiple units.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; The publication also observes that pressure to cut emissions within the railway industry is likely to play a role in stimulating demand for the uptake of hydrail.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;

A key technology of a typical hydrogen propulsion system is the [[fuel cell]]. This device converts the [[chemical energy]] contained within the hydrogen in order to generate electricity, as well as water and heat.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; As such, a fuel cell would operate in a manner that is essentially inverse to the electrolysis process used to create the fuel; consuming pure hydrogen to produce electricity rather than consuming electrical energy to produce hydrogen, albeit incurring some level of energy losses in the exchange.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; Reportedly, the efficiency of converting electricity to hydrogen and back again is just beneath 30 per cent, roughly similar to contemporary diesel engines but less than conventional electric traction using [[Overhead line|overhead catenary wires]]. The electricity produced by the onboard fuel cell would be fed into a [[motor]] to propel the train.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; Overhead wire electrification costs are around EUR 2m/km, so electrification is not a cost-efficient solution for routes with low traffic, and battery and hydrail solutions may be alternatives.&lt;ref name="ec2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Final Report of the High-Level Panel of the European Decarbonisation Pathways Initiative |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_innovation/research_by_area/documents/ec_rtd_decarbonisation-report_112018.pdf |publisher=[[European Commission]] |page=57 |date=November 2018 |doi=10.2777/636 |isbn=978-92-79-96827-3 |quote=Hydrogen fuel cell trains are also more expensive than diesel ones (+30 %)  because  their  energy  costs  are  currently  higher  and  they  are  less  efficient than electric trains. However, their GHG emissions are 45 % lower than diesel,  even  if  hydrogen  is  produced  via  steam  methane  reforming.  These  58 emissions can  decrease  to  almost  negligible  levels  when  using  green  and  low-carbon  hydrogen.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Railway industrial publication Railway Engineer has theorised that the expanding prevalence of wind power has led to some countries having surpluses of electrical energy during nighttime hours, and that this trend could offer a means of low-cost and highly available energy with which hydrogen could be conveniently produced via electrolysis.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; In this manner, it is believed that the production of hydrogen using [[Peak demand#Off-peak|off-peak]] electricity available from countries' [[electrical grid]]s shall likely be one of the most economic practices available. As of January 2017, hydrogen produced via electrolysis commonly costs roughly the same as [[natural gas]] and almost double that of diesel fuel; however, unlike either of these fossil-based fuels, hydrogen propulsion produces zero vehicle emissions.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; A 2018 [[European Commission]] report states that if hydrogen is produced by [[steam methane reforming]], hydrail emissions are 45 % lower than diesel trains.&lt;ref name="ec2018"/&gt;

According to Rail Engineer and Alstom, a 10MW wind farm is capable of comfortably producing 2.5 tonnes of hydrogen per day;  enough to power a fleet of 14 iLint trains over a distance of 600&amp;nbsp;km per day.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; Reportedly, as of January 2017, production of hydrogen worldwide has been expanding in quantity and availability, increasing its attractiveness as a fuel. The need to build up a capable distribution network for hydrogen, which in turn requires substantial investments to be made, is likely to play a role in restraining the growth of hydrail at least in the short term.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;

It was observed by Railway Technology that the rail industry has been historically slow to adopt new technologies and relatively conservative in outlook; however, a successful large-scale deployment of this technology by an early adopter may be decisive in overcoming attitudes of reluctance and traditionalism.&lt;ref name = "rai tech 16"/&gt; Additionally, there could be significant benefits to transitioning from diesel to hydrail propulsion. According to the results of a study performed by a consortium of [[Hitachi#Hitachi Rail|Hitachi Rail Europe]], the [[University of Birmingham]], and Fuel Cell Systems Ltd, hydrail vehicles in the form of re-powered diesel multiple units could be capable of generating significant energy consumption reductions; reportedly, their model indicated a saving of up to 52 per cent on the [[Norwich]] to [[Sheringham]] line over conventional traction.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;

===Hydrolley===
A ''hydrolley'' is a term for a [[streetcar]] or tram (trolley) powered by hydrail technology. The term (for ''hydro''gen tro''lley'') was coined at the Fourth International Hydrail Conference, Valencia, Spain, in 2008, as a research-simplifying search engine target word. Onboard hydrogen-derived power eliminates the need for overhead trolley arms and track electrification, greatly reducing construction cost, reducing [[visual pollution]] and eliminating the maintenance expense of track electrification. The term 'hydrolley' is preferred to 'hydrail light rail' or other combinations which might connote external electrification.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In rail transportation, a '''rolling highway''', or '''rolling road''' is a form of [[combined transport]] involving the conveying of [[truck|road trucks]] by rail, referred to as Ro-La trains. The concept is a form of [[Piggyback (transportation)|piggyback transportation]].

The technical challenges to implement rolling highways vary from region to region.  In North America, the [[loading gauge]] is often high enough to accommodate [[Double stack rail cars|double stack containers]], so the height of a truck on a [[flat car]] is no issue.  However, in Europe, except for purpose built lines such as the [[Channel Tunnel]] or the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]], the loading gauge height is much smaller, and it is necessary to transport the trailers with the tires about {{convert|30|cm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} above the rails, so the trailers cannot be simply parked on the surface of a flat car above the [[Train wheel|wagon wheels]] or [[bogie]].  Making the wagon wheels smaller limits the maximum speed, so many designs allow the trailer to be transported with its wheels lower than the rail wagon wheels.  An early approach in France was the ''kangourou''&lt;ref&gt;http://roadmaster-087.skyrock.com/3197907081-SNCF-Kangourou.html Piggyback transport in the 60s video in French&lt;/ref&gt; with modified trailers. This technology did not survive, due to the market resistance to modified trailers. Today two designs for these special wagons are in commercial service, "[[Modalohr]]" and "[[Cargobeamer]]".

During a rolling-highway journey, if the drivers accompany the trailer, they are accommodated in a passenger car with seats or beds. At both ends of the rail link there are purpose-built terminals that allow the train to be easily loaded and unloaded.

== Examples of rolling highways ==
Rolling highways are mostly used for transit routes, e.g. through the [[Alps]] or from western to eastern Europe.

=== Austria ===
In [[Austria]], rolling highways exist from [[Bavaria]] via [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] to [[Italy]] or to [[Eastern Europe]]. Traditionally, Austria is a transit country and therefore the rolling highway is of environmental importance. In 1999 the [[Austrian Federal Railways]] (ÖBB) carried 254,000 trucks, which equals {{convert|8500000|t}} of load (including vehicle's weight) (158,989 trucks in 1993). The rolling highway trains in Austria are operated by Ökombi GmbH, a division of [[Rail Cargo Austria]], the cargo division of ÖBB. There is a direct rolling highway between [[Salzburg]] and the harbour of [[Trieste]], Italy, where the trucks arrive on [[ferry|ferries]] from [[Turkey]]. In those cases, drivers arrive by plane via [[Ljubljana]] airport, to take over the trucks.

=== India ===
[[File:RoroTrainKhed.JPG|thumb|Trucks on the [[Konkan Railway]] Rolling Highway]]
In 1999, the [[Konkan Railway Corporation]] introduced the ''[[Konkan Railway Corporation#RORO|Roll On Roll Off]]'' (RORO) service on the section between [[Kolad]] in [[Maharashtra]] and [[Verna, Goa|Verna]] in [[Goa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ROAD-RAIL SYNERGY SYSTEM  |url=http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page1.asp?relid=949|work=Press release, Press Information Bureau, dated 2004-20-05 |accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was extended up to [[Surathkal]] in [[Karnataka]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=186663|work=Online edition of the Business Standard, dated 2004-06-16|title=New Konkan Rly service begins|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2004/06/12/stories/2004061200931900.htm|work=The Hindu Business Line|title=RORO Service Again on Konkan Railway|date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RORO service, the first of its kind in India, allowed trucks to be transported on [[flatcar]]s.

=== Switzerland ===
In [[Switzerland]], rolling highways across the Alps exist for both the [[Gotthardbahn|Gotthard]] and [[Lötschberg railway line|Lötschberg]] - [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] route. They are operated by RAlpin AG, headquartered in [[Olten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralpin.com/ RAlpin AG]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, 2015, BLS cargo launched a service between Cologne and Milan capable to transport 4m articulated lorry trailers.

In 2018, 51% of the [[Trans-European Rail network|Ten-T network]] has been made adequate to P\C 80 [[loading gauge]], required for [[European Railway Agency|ERA]] [[ERA Technical Specifications for Interoperability|Technical Specifications for Interoperability]] to conveying road trucks by train.
Within 2026, 78% of the Ten-T network is going to be adequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite publication |url=https://www.mercintreno.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Mercintreno-27-settembre-2017-Simeri-Piccioni-Ferrovie-delle-Stato.pptx |last=Simeri |first=Rosanna |last2=Piccioni  |first2=Daria |title=MERCINTRENO 2017 «Una prima analisi degli effetti sul sistema ferroviario merci della presenza del Gottardo a circa un anno dalla sua inaugurazione» |publisher=Direzione Commerciale ed Esercizio Rete [[Trenitalia|RFI]] |p=12 |date=2017-09-27 |language=It}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
Two rolling highways are currently in operation in France, both using French Modalohr technology: the 175&amp;nbsp;km [[Alpine rolling highway|Autoroute Ferroviaire Alpine]], connecting the [[Savoy]] region to Turin through the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel]] owned and operated jointly by [[SNCF]] and [[Trenitalia]], and the 1,050&amp;nbsp;km  [[Lorry-Rail S.A.|Lorry-Rail]] which connects [[Bettembourg]], [[Luxembourg]], to [[Perpignan]] operated by SNCF. Lorry-Rail only carries trailers, while the AFA carries accompanied and unaccompanied trailers. Since June 2012, these two are operated under the brand "VIIA" by [[SNCF Geodis]].

Plans have been announced to add two more routes in France.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
There is a service similar to rolling highways in eastern Canada, however, only the trailers of the trucks can be brought on to the train. 
[[Canadian Pacific Railway]] serves between [[Windsor, Ontario]] and [[Montreal]] (and further east). This corridor is normally truck serviced on the [[Ontario Highway 401]], [[Quebec Autoroute 20]] but this section of the highway becomes heavily congested in several areas, especially around [[Toronto]] and Montreal. With CP's service, one truck will drop off the trailer at the terminal and a different truck will pick up the trailer at the other end. This avoids truckers having to take overnight stops, and it greatly reduces  costs in some situations. This service now accounts for a considerable percentage of CP's traffic in the area.

A '''hospital train''' is a [[railway]] [[train]] with [[railway carriage|carriages]] equipped for the provision of [[healthcare]]. Historically this has ranged from trains equipped to transport wounded soldiers, with basic nursing and first aid facilities on board, to fully equipped mobile medical centres, sometimes including operating theatres and nursing wards.

==History==

===Origins===
[[Image:Crimean Railway 2.jpg|thumb|The railway yard at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]], where the first hospital train operated, during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;br&gt;Photograph by [[Roger Fenton]].]]
The first hospital train was built during the [[Crimean War]] in the 1850s. Poorly operated logistical supply networks and inadequate health provisions for the British army [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|encamped]] around the Russian port of [[Sevastopol]] caused a public outcry in England. To alleviate these problems, the [[Grand Crimean Central Railway]] was initially built by a partnership of English railway contractors led by [[Samuel Morton Peto]]in 1855, to supply ammunition and provisions to Allied soldiers. Within three weeks of the arrival of the fleet carrying materials and men the railway had started to run and in seven weeks {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} of track had been completed.  The railway was a major factor leading to the success of the siege. The line was surveyed by [[Donald Campbell (engineer)|Donald Campbell]].&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{citation | last =Cooke | first =Brian  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Grand Crimean Central Railway | publisher =Cavalier House | year =1990  | location =Knutsford | pages = 16–30|isbn =0-9515889-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the railway's primary function was the supply of armaments and equipment, the train was also used for the transport of the wounded. The first such instance of this occurred on April 2, 1855, when the train was used to carry the sick and injured from the plateau down to the dock at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]].&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt; Towards and during the second winter, the supplies carried by the railway were different. The siege had ended, carriage of ammunition was less important, and the supplies related more to the accommodation and comfort of the troops.  These included huts to replace tents, clothing, food, books and medical supplies. Following the completion of the Sardinian branch, the railway had reached its limit. In all, it measured about {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} plus a few miles of sidings and loops.&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt;

===Expansion===

[[File:HL Damals – SK WKI 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Departure of the hospital train from Lübeck on October 27, 1914]]
Hospital trains were subsequently used during the [[Franco-Austrian War]], the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. They were also used extensively during colonial campaigns, notably in the [[Anglo-Zulu War]].&lt;ref name="McCallum"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5BXB9QtUfFQC|title=Military Medicine: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century|author=Jack Edward McCallum|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these hospital trains remained primarily as troop trains, with the passengers restricted to the wounded and dying. They had little or nothing in terms of onboard medical facilities, although [[nurse]]s traveled with the wounded and the carriages of the trains were painted with [[red cross]]es to indicate their humanitarian role and to prevent enemy attack.

It was during the [[First World War]] that trains began to be used as mobile medical facilities along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and other subsidiary theatres of the War. Ambulance trains were organised by the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] with onboard surgical wards and essential medical supplies. Trains were used to evacuate over 100,000 British casualties from the battlefield at [[Flanders]] in one month of 1914 alone.&lt;ref name="McCallum" /&gt;

These trains were able to connect with [[hospital ship]]s at French [[Channel Ports|channel ports]] in order to repatriate wounded British soldiers back to England. There are numbers of extant journal entries from those who experienced the hospital trains of this era, many being referred to as "Great White Hospital Trains", as the carriages were often painted white or red and white.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/Hospital_Train/Hospital_Train_01.htm here] for one example of an extensive journal entry from the first world war hospital trains in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospital trains were used on a large scale during the [[Second World War]] by all the major combatants and, to a more limited extent, during the [[Korean War]]. By that time, however, mobile motor transport and [[Medical evacuation|aerial evacuation]] supplanted the train as the dominant form of mobile medical provision on the battlefield.

==Currently operating hospital trains==

===Russian Hospital Trains===
Russian local government and state rail services operate five trains since 2010 during specific times of the year, each one carrying medical staff from the regional cities and traveling remote regions, e.g. in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/2017/05/19/russia-trains-medical-care-607346.html|title=In rural Siberia, the hospital comes to you|last=EDT|first=Damien Sharkov On 05/11/17 at 8:27 AM|date=2017-05-11|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sovereign Military Order of Malta===
The [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), which is a sovereign entity (similar to an independent country, though with no sovereign land), has a history of operating hospital trains through its military branch, known as the Military Corps of the Order. The operation of such trains reached its peak in the Second World War, but SMOM continues to operate such trains today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orderofmalta.org/zoomfoto.asp?IDFoto=69&amp;idlingua=5 Ordine di Malta - Sito Ufficiale - Archivio Fotografico&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include trains of carriages to provide shelter to refugees, with basic medical provision, and more technically equipped trains, on which a wide range of medical services may be provided.

===Lifeline Express of India===
The [[Lifeline Express]] is an example of a modern hospital train of a highly technologically advanced type. Operated by the Impact India Foundation since 1991, these trains have had a profound impact on Indian rural healthcare provision.&lt;ref&gt;See the Impact India website [http://www.impactindia.org/lifeline.htm here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501045455/http://www.impactindia.org/lifeline.htm |date=2009-05-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating in India, across the extensive network of the [[Indian Railways]], the Lifeline trains (known colloquially as "magic trains") move from town to town, remaining in a siding or platform at each town's [[railway station]] for perhaps a week or so, and providing advanced medical services (often beyond the capabilities of local medical centres) to those who apply for them, through a simple vetting or [[triage]] process, which ensures services are provided to those most likely to benefit. These trains include nursing wards, and full-scale operating theatres. They have resident medical and nursing staff, but for surgical procedures they rely upon the charitable provision of time and talents by Indian surgeons who spend some of their free time on board the trains for that purpose.

===Chinese eye hospital trains===
{{main|Lifeline Express China}}
The state-owned [[China Railway]] company currently operates four eye hospital trains, the fourth and latest being operated through the [[CSR Corporation Limited|CSR Corporation]], and having entered service in early 2009 for the benefit of residents of the [[Sichuan]] Province. A range of [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] surgeries, including the common [[cataract]] removal operation, can be provided free of charge on board the trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/csr-rolls-out-eye-hospital-train.html | title=CSR rolls out eye hospital train | work=[[Railway Gazette International]]| date=18 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phelophepa Trains in South Africa ===
The Phelophea trains have been founded 1994 and are sponsored by companies and private donors. They operate as mobile hospitals and have thus far reached 23 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trainofhope.org/|title=Train of Hope – American Friends of the Phelophepa Train|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SNCF Hospital Train ===
French railway [[SNCF]] adapted a five-unit [[TGV]] high-speed train in March 2020 for use as a mobile hospital in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The train is used to transport COVID19 patients to hospitals with open beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/life/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-france-train-hospital-tgv-covid-19-patient/608833/|title=To Fight a Fast-Moving Pandemic, Get a Faster Hospital|last=O'Sullivan|first=Feargus|date=March 26, 2020|website=CityLab|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Re 460 SRG SSR idée suisse am Gotthard.jpg|thumb|350px|InterRegio train in the [[Swiss Alps]]]]
The '''InterRegio''' is a [[train]] service seen in some [[Europe]]an countries. Mostly they are trains that run "from region to region", as best described by [[Swiss Federal Railways]].

==Belgium==
In Belgium, InterRegio (IR) trains were slower than the fast IC trains, and usually called at more stations along a route. Their journey was usually not as long as IC trains, but still traveled further than the local (L) trains.

Most IR trains had hourly frequencies, some having only services every two hours (although this is mostly true only for weekend services).

All trains in Belgium shared the same cost structure, so taking an IR train cost the same as an IC or L train for the same route. The only difference lay in the number of station stops they called at.

In December 2014 the InterRegio was withdrawn, InterRegio lines were either converted to [[InterCity]] or local train or cancelled completely.

==Switzerland==
The InterRegio in Switzerland was first introduced in 1997. They replaced some of the former fast trains with their own identity (InterRegio).

InterRegio trains are now very commonplace in Switzerland. The abbreviation is '''IR''' in a 45°-edgy font, white letters on red.

The [[ICN (SBB-CFF-FFS)|ICN]] runs as an InterCity train but sometimes with halt frequencies in the same manner as an IR ([[Geneva]]/[[Lausanne]]-[[St. Gallen]]/[[Basel]] route) and sometimes as IC trains ([[Basel]]-[[Chiasso]]). When ICN services first began on May 28, 2000, the ICN was placed as an InterRegio train.

==Germany==
InterRegio trains were also commonplace in Germany from 1988 to 2003. They travelled and mainly connected regions in Germany. Most of the InterRegio lines have been replaced by [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|InterCity]] lines; a few were replaced by the newly established [[Interregio-Express]] (IRE) type. However, Interregio-Express lines belong technically to the short distance train category, and tend to be shorter. InterRegio trains were very popular as they could be used without supplement - DB scrapped them, hoping customers would trade up to [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|InterCity]] (IC) or [[Intercity Express]] (ICE) trains, a policy that was only partially successful, and then only when the SparPreis brand of tickets were introduced.

==Denmark==
The InterRegio system was also introduced to the Danish railways in the early 1990s and became an alternative to the InterCity services, with no seat reservation required.
However, unlike other countries, InterRegio trains in Denmark only operates on Fridays and Sundays, to support the heavy flow of passengers that travel on those days. These InterRegio services also have fewer stops than the InterCity services, which goes against the original InterRegio concept of long-distance trains with more local stops.
There are no specific rules for the composition for these trains, and both old and new material has been used for InterRegio services.

==Poland==
[[Image:Przewozy Regionalne locomotive E 186 143-4.JPG|right|thumb|250px|An [[PKP class EU43|EU43]] ([[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] [[TRAXX]]) locomotive with a [[Bydgoszcz]]-[[Warsaw]] InterRegio train]]

In Poland, interREGIO trains were introduced by [[Przewozy Regionalne]] (PR) in spring of 2009, the first IR train connecting [[Białystok]] with [[Warsaw]]. The fare is similar as ''TLK''-branded fast trains of [[PKP Intercity]].

In the beginning these trains operated mostly on Fridays and Sundays along the routes: [[Wrocław]]-[[Kraków]], Kraków-[[Przemyśl]], [[Poznań]]-[[Olsztyn]], Poznań-Warsaw and [[Bydgoszcz]]-Warsaw. Since June 2009 there are more interREGIO trains on routes; most of them are available through the whole week, some of them only on weekends. More routes were introduced, some of which are especially made for students, like [[Kielce]]-[[Częstochowa]]-Wrocław.

InterREGIO in Poland mostly uses older [[electric multiple unit]]s (usually [[PKP class ED72|ED72]], [[PKP class EN71|EN71]] and [[PKP class EN57|EN57]]), with newer units on some routes ([[PKP class ED73|ED73]] and [[PKP class ED59|ED59]] between Warsaw and [[Łódź]], [[14WE]] between Kraków and Warsaw). Some IR trains are serviced with single- and/or [[Bilevel rail car|double-decker cars]] and locomotives.

{{As of|2009|1|1}}, all IR trains in Poland are second class-only, even though PR's regulations include a first-class fare for interREGIO trains and in service are first-class coaches, yet declassified.

Since September 1, 2015 IR trains are only on routes [[Łódź]] – [[Warsaw|Warszawa]] and [[Ełk]] – [[Grodno]] (Belarus), due to company's economics and restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zmiany w ofercie Przewozów Regionalnych|url=http://www.przewozyregionalne.pl/node/18425|publisher=Przewozy Regionalne|accessdate=18 September 2015|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest were withdrawn or replaced by [[PKP Intercity|''Twoje Linie Kolejowe'']] express trains.

'''Szczekociny rail crash'''

On 3 March 2012, the [[Szczekociny train collision]] occurred, with 15 deaths and 50 injured

==Hungary==

[[Image:Interregio train in Pörböly.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A Hungarian InterRégio train in [[Gemenc]] between [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] and [[Bátaszék]] ]]

The InterRégió trains were introduced in Hungary on 13 December 2009. InterRégió trains run mainly on regional lines, but their function is national as well. The trains operate along the lines [[Sárbogárd]]–[[Szekszárd]]–[[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] and [[Kecskemét]]–Baja–[[Dombóvár]]. InterRégió trains use air-conditioned [[MÁV 6341]] [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]]-s which were built by the Russian [[Metrovagonmash]].

The '''CTA Holiday Train''' is a [[Chicago 'L']] train which traditionally runs during the winter holidays, from November to December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Next Stop, North Pole. Doors Open on the Left...| url=http://www.lifeinchicago.net/2008/11/next-stop-north-pole-doors-open-on-left.html| accessdate=December 3, 2011| website=Life in Chicago| date=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six cars are traditional passenger cars adorned with seasonal decorations and bright lights.  The interior of these cars are adorned with multi-color lights, red bows, garland, and red and green overhead lighting.  The hand poles are transformed into inedible candy canes.  [[Santa Claus]] rides on an open-air flatcar and waves to the passengers coming aboard from his sleigh.

== History ==
[[File:20011123 21 CTA Santa Claus Train (8048645345).jpg|right|thumb|Train with Santa Claus in 2001]]

[[File:20131129 16 CTA Holiday Train.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of the CTA Holiday Train.]]
The CTA Holiday train began in 1992.  That first year, employees posted a sign on the front of the train that read, "Seasons Greeting from the CTA."  The train delivered food to various charities around the city.  Since then, the decorations have become much more elaborate.  Now, there is a flatcar for Santa and his reindeer; and the interior is covered with lights, paper, streamers and decorative signs.&lt;ref name=Current&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagocurrent.com/articles/30824-CTA-holiday-train-coming-to-a-platform-near-you| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525203023/http://www.chicagocurrent.com/articles/30824-CTA-holiday-train-coming-to-a-platform-near-you| archivedate=May 25, 2011| title=CTA holiday train coming to a platform near you| date=December 1, 2009| website=Chicago Current| first=Ben| last=Meyerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schedule ==
The Holiday Train visits [[List of Chicago 'L' stations|every Chicago 'L' station]] on every line throughout its run during November and December.  The train operates from about 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on select weekdays and makes all scheduled stops at stations along the line.&lt;ref name=CTA_HolidayTrainPage&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.transitchicago.com/holidaytrain/| website=CTA| title=CTA Holiday Train &amp; Bus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charity run ===
Over the period of five days a week, the CTA Holiday Train delivers food baskets to local community organizations at various stops.  Food baskets contain various foods for a complete meal; these include canned ham, potatoes, mixed vegetables, fruits and a dessert.&lt;ref name=CTA_HolidayTrainPage /&gt;

==Reception==
The song "CTA X-mas Train",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTbbBc9sCTs| title=CTA X-Mas Train| website=YouTube| author=superwesman| date=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the Holiday Train, by the Snow Angels was the winner of the [[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Tribune's]] New Holiday Classics Christmas song contest in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Best holiday song heralds CTA Holiday Train; Thanksgiving caption contest| journal=CTA Tattler| date=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It narrowly avoided being shut down by CTA president [[Frank Kruesi]] after the budget cuts of 2004.  A spokesman said, "It didn't seem appropriate to devote resources to this project when 1,250 positions are being eliminated".  He was, however, overruled by CTA board chair Carole Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=CTA derails Santa Train| journal=CTA Tattler| date=December 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the cost to the CTA to run the train is minimal.  Decorations are reused from year to year or donated by CTA employees.  As the trains run regular service, most workers are either on their regular schedules or volunteering their time.&lt;ref name=Current /&gt;

'''National Train Day''' was a holiday started by [[Amtrak]] in 2008 as a method to spread information to the general public about the advantages of railway travel and the history of trains in the United States. It was held each year on the Saturday closest to May 10, the anniversary of the pounding of the [[Golden spike]] in [[Promontory, Utah]], which marked the completion of the [[first transcontinental railroad]] in the U.S. Events were held at major Amtrak stations as well as railroad museums across the country and often have passenger cars and model railroad layouts on display. The largest events took place in [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Washington, D.C.]], [[30th Street Station|Philadelphia]], [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]] and [[LAUPT|Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-05-04-amtrak-trainday_N.htm  |title = Amtrak readies for National Train Day|publisher=USA Today | date=May 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Train Day was discontinued after 2015 due to budget cuts within Amtrak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Steve| last = Glischinski | title = Amtrak: National Train Day is done | work = [[Trains (magazine)|Trains]] | date = March 7, 2016 | url= http://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2016/03/07-national-train-day | accessdate =May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other rail organizations continue to observe the holiday.

==Events==
The major events of National Train Day usually consist of equipment displays in the major stations across the Amtrak system. This includes ''[[Acela Express]]'' and ''[[Keystone Service]]'' sets in the Northeastern cities, and [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner]] cars in [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]], [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles]], [[San Antonio station (Texas)|San Antonio]] and [[Florida]] that are used on long distance trains in those regions. In addition, many private cars are also put on display. Other large cities featured rail equipment and displays from freight railroads, transit agencies, non-profit rail organizations and historical societies as part of National Train Day.  Some smaller events consisted of a model train layout from a local club or other train-related items on display.

Because of a scheduling conflict on the original National Train Day in 2008, Toledo Union Station hosted their NTD event a week before the rest of the country in 2008. This tradition of having the 'first' Train Day has continued every year since at the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Plaza (Toledo)|Martin Luther King, Jr. Plaza]] Amtrak and intermodal station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/National-Train-Day-Toledo/120247864663680|title=National Train Day Toledo|publisher=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides events at active Amtrak stations, railway history museums participate in National Train Day as well. This often includes tours of historic rail cars and excursion train rides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvisit.com/eventdetail.aspx?id=10329|title=National Train Day at Danbury Railway Museum|publisher=www.CTVisit.com}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amtrak locomotive 406.jpg|thumb|Amtrak 406 at Washington Union Station for National Train Day 2011 painted in heritage livery with markings commemorating the start of Amtrak service.]]
The 2011 event celebrated Amtrak's 40th Anniversary celebration, as the company first went into service on May 1, 1971.

The National Association of Railroad Passengers, the largest non-profit rail advocacy organization in America, announced that their members would be celebrating the first National Train Day in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.narprail.org/releases-statements--letters/narp-to-celebrate-national-train-day-calls-on-policymakers-to-support-grow-trains-campaign |title=NARP to Celebrate National Train Day |date=May 7, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other non-profits participated regionally.

In 2013, [[Duluth, Minnesota]], hosted one of the largest events, having steam locomotives [[Milwaukee Road 261]] and [[Soo Line 2719]] operating on the [[North Shore Scenic Railroad]], as well as large museum displays and events.

In 2015, it was announced that the community program called National Train Day would be replaced by a company sponsored event called Amtrak Train Days.  The format changed from multiple events on a single day in many cities to individual events over the course of the spring, summer and fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Amtrak Announces Amtrak Train Days Tour And Exhibit Train Locations |url=http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/344/18/Amtrak-Train-Days-Partners-Locations-ATK-15-021.pdf |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Amtrak |date=April 8, 2015 |access-date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity spokespersons==
Every National Train Day through 2012 featured an official celebrity spokesperson who appears at a single event.
*2008: [[Al Roker]], television weatherman and actor
*2009: [[Randy Jackson]], ''[[American Idol]]'' judge
*2010: [[Taye Diggs]], actor
*2011: [[Gladys Knight]], "[[Midnight Train to Georgia]]" singer
*2012: [[Rosario Dawson]], ''[[Unstoppable (2010 film)|Unstoppable]]'' movie actress

On National Train Day May 8, 2010 in [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York Penn Station]], the cast of ''[[Cake Boss]]'' presented a special cake to Amtrak for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/08/cake_boss_buddy_valastro_goes.html|title='Cake Boss' Buddy Valastro presents train cake at Penn Station|publisher=NJ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrity spokespersons were discontinued after 2012.

The '''heaviest trains''' in the world are freight trains hauling bulk commodities such as coal and iron ore.

The weight of trains generally does not include the weight of the operating locomotives; this is not considered dead weight, so is not included. If for example a train had two locomotives operating and was simply hauling a third off line, this third locomotive would be included in the payload weight.

== Specifications ==

=== Gauge ===

If the track and its alignment are strong, gauge is not so important. Among railways with over {{convert|20,000|t|0|abbr=on}} gross train weight, the [[Sishen–Saldanha railway line]] uses {{Track gauge|1067mm|lk=on}}, while the others use {{Track gauge|1435mm|allk=on}}.

Most Pilbara region railways operate on pre-stressed {{convert|68|kg/m|lb/yd|0|abbr=on}} [[Rail profile|rail]],{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} meaning that each metre of track weighs 68&amp;nbsp;kg or each yard of track weighs 137&amp;nbsp;pounds. This gives the track the strength to carry such heavy loads.

=== Axle load ===
The highest permitted [[axleload|weight per axle]] is:
* 2008 – [[Fortescue Metals Group|Fortescue]] – {{convert|42|t|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmgl.com.au/irm/ShowStaticCategory.aspx?CategoryID=213&amp;HideTopLine=True |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628060821/http://www.fmgl.com.au/IRM/ShowStaticCategory.aspx?CategoryID=213&amp;HideTopLine=True |archivedate=2010-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pandrol.com/index.php?/news/story/pandrol_double_heavy_haul_acceptance_the_longest_and_the_heaviest/&lt;/ref&gt;
Compare:
* 1830 – [[Stephenson's Rocket]] {{convert|2.2|t|2|abbr=on}}
The [[track bed]] and the strength of the [[Track (rail transport)|rail]]s themselves limit the axle load.

=== Line load ===
Line load is the weight per metre or foot of train length. The [[Theodore Cooper#Coopers Loading System|strength of bridges]] is what mainly limits this.
Examples:
* {{convert|12|t/m|LT/ft ST/ft|2}} ([[Iron Ore Line]], Sweden)

=== Curves ===

Curves must not be too sharp; wagons may be pulled off the track and derailed, especially with general freight trains where light and heavy wagons are intermixed, less so if all cars in a train are loaded and unloaded at the same place and equally much. The meaning of "too sharp" depends as much on experience as on a specific formula.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Couplers ===
The [[Railway coupling|couplers]] must be strong enough in heavy trains. [[Janney coupler]]s are used for the heaviest trains. The [[SA3 coupler]]s handle trains of {{convert|6,000|–|8,000|t|sigfig=3}}, as Russian trains limited by loop lengths, etc.;  maximum load of SA3 couplers have not been tested.  The standard [[buffers and chain coupler]]s used in Europe can only handle {{convert|3,000|–|4,000|t|sigfig=3}} train weight, but trials are made to push this limit to {{convert|5400|t|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SNCF and RFF  put Europe’s  longest train  to the test {{!}} SNCF|url = http://www.sncf.com/en/news/marathon-train|website = www.sncf.com|access-date = 2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Neues in Kürze: Frankreich SNCF|last = |first = |date = February 2016|journal = Eisenbahn Amateur|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page =75|issn = 0013-2764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They go from Kostomuksha to [[Oulu]], Finland, as 60-car unit trains measuring approximately {{convert|880|m}} in length. In Finland these trains are hauled by two [[VR Class Sr2|Sr2 class]] electric locomotives at {{25 kV 50 Hz}} while in Russia trains are hauled by double-section [[2TE116|2TE116 class]] diesel engines. Due to the restrictions caused by [[passing loop]] lengths between Oulu and the port of [[Kokkola]] the trains are shortened to 30-40 cars in Oulu and are usually operated with [[VR Class Sr1|Sr1 class]] electric locomotives for the rest of the way. The trains use exclusively Russian rolling stock and are equipped with SA3 couplers.

=== Sierra Leone ===
Sierra Leone had a {{RailGauge|762mm}} narrow gauge railway with 5&amp;nbsp;t axleloads.  Train loads were necessarily very limited, which increased costs counter-productively, as large numbers of small trains were needed to haul tonnages that heavier railways could haul with fewer
trains.  For example, in 1956 fourteen modern 4-8-2+2-8-4 Garratts were purchased from Beyer-Peacock.&lt;ref&gt;[[RailwaysAfrica]] September 2009, p14&lt;/ref&gt;  These locos increased the maximum load over 1:50 grades from 200 [[Long ton|tons]] (203 [[tonne]]s) to 270 tons (274 tonnes).

=== Sweden / Norway ===
* On the [[Iron Ore Line]] which goes between [[Luleå]], Sweden and [[Narvik]], Norway, iron ore trains are hauled by {{convert|360|t|abbr=on}} [[IORE]] locomotives. These {{convert|8660|t|abbr=on}} trains (incl locomotive) are the heaviest in Europe. Special [[SA3 coupler|SA3]] [[Railway coupling|couplers]], and [[15 kV AC railway electrification|15&amp;nbsp;kV {{frac|16|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;Hz]] electrification are used. The iron trains go either [[Kiruna]]-Narvik or [[Gällivare]]-Luleå. Other very heavy trains go in flat areas but these trains go through a mountain range, although the uphill [[Grade (slope)|grades]] are at most 10 [[‰]] (1 [[Percent sign|%]]) in the direction with loaded trains. Other heavy trains in Sweden are no more than {{convert|3500|t|abbr=on}} limited by [[buffers and chain coupler]]s.

[[File:InterCity.svg|thumb|InterCity logo of the [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]], 1971–1991]]

'''InterCity''' (commonly abbreviated '''''IC''''' on timetables and tickets) is the classification applied to certain long-distance [[passenger train]] services in Europe. Such trains (in contrast to regional, local, or commuter trains) generally call at major [[railway station|station]]s only.

An international variant of the InterCity trains are the [[EuroCity]] (EC) trains which consist of high-standard coaches and are run by a variety of operators.

==History ==
The Inter-City Rapid Transit Company was an [[Ohio]] [[interurban]] company, which began operations in 1930 as it had purchased its route from the Northern Ohio Traction &amp; Light Company. It remained in operation till 1940.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.american-rails.com/interurbans.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of ''Inter-City'' was reborn in the United Kingdom: A daily [[The Inter-City|train of that name]] was introduced in 1950, running between the cities of [[London]] and [[Birmingham]]. This usage can claim to be the origin of all later usages worldwide.

In 1966 [[British Rail]] introduced the brand InterCity for all of its express train routes, and in 1986 the term was adopted by the [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity sector of British Rail]]. Following the privatisation of the railways in Great Britain, the term is no longer in official use there although many people still refer to fast long-distance services as InterCity trains. The brand still exists though, and belongs to the [[Department for Transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00001277000 |publisher=Intellectual Property Office |title=Trademark registration UKUK00001277000 - "INTERCITY"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IC Steuerwagen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Deutsche Bahn|DB]] InterCity [[cab car]] in [[Bremen Hauptbahnhof|Bremen Hbf]]]]
In West Germany, the [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] first used the name (then written ''Intercity'') in 1968, denoting special first-class services on the [[F-Zug]] train network.  Many of the [[DB Class VT 11.5|Class VT 11.5]] [[diesel multiple unit]]s formerly used on the [[Trans Europ Express|TEE]] network were converted for early Intercity services.

In Switzerland, the InterCity brand replaced SwissExpress in the 1982 schedule.

In Norway, ''intercity'' (later also written ''InterCity'') trains were introduced in 1975 on the Vestfold Line (the [[Oslo]]-[[Skien]] service), later also on the Østfold Line (Oslo-[[Halden]]). They were (relatively) fast trains on distances up to 2–3 hours. Today, the name is used not on the trains, but on the main lines from Oslo to Skien, [[Lillehammer]], and Halden – and also on the Ringerike Line, which is under construction from Oslo to Hønefoss.

An international variant of InterCity, [[EuroCity]] (EC), was introduced in May 1987. EuroCity trains consist of high-standard, [[air conditioned]] coaches, are run by a variety of operators, and are usually subject to on-board border controls. For example, EuroCity trains running in Germany can be made up by [[rolling stock]] of either the [[Swiss Federal Railways|SBB]] (Switzerland), [[ÖBB]] (Austria), [[SNCF]] (France), and less commonly by stock of the Czech [[ČD]] and Hungarian [[MÁV]] railways.

The [[Austrian Federal Railways]] (ÖBB) have operated IC services since 1991. However, contrary to most other countries, these are often little more than [[regional rail]], as most long-distance, high-standard trains in Austria are likely to be [[EuroCity]] (EC) services, even when not leaving the Austrian borders (named ''ÖBB-EuroCity'' until 2011). Modernised stock of [[Eurofima coach]]es is used under the brand name ''ÖBB-InterCity'' (OIC) mainly on the Austrian [[Western Railway (Austria)|Western]] and [[Southern Railway (Austria)|Southern Railway]]s from [[Vienna]] to [[Salzburg]] and [[Villach]].

The ÖBB also deployed [[electric multiple unit]] trains, from 2006 also three [[ICE T]] (Class 411, named ''ÖBB 4011'') trainsets in cooperation with the [[Deutsche Bahn]], currently running from Vienna to [[Frankfurt]] via [[Linz]] and [[Passau]]. ÖBB [[high-speed rail]] service is provided by [[Railjet]] (RJ) trains.

Since 2011, there is an hourly express train service on the Western Railway operated by [[WESTbahn]], the only long-distance competitor of the ÖBB.

IC-Services:
* Western Railway
** [[Vienna]]–[[Linz]]–[[Salzburg]] (trains are operating from 5 am to 10 pm, hourly)
* Southern Railway
** Vienna–[[Bruck an der Mur]]–[[Klagenfurt]]–[[Villach]] (every 2 hours with several trains running as EC)
** Vienna–Bruck an der Mur–[[Graz]] (every 2 hours with several trains running as EC, 4 trains heading to [[Maribor]], [[Ljubljana]] and [[Zagreb]])
** Vienna–[[Wiener Neustadt]]–[[Mattersburg]]–[[Sopron]]–[[Csorna]]
** Graz–Klagenfurt (service is operating as ''Intercitybus'' till the [[Koralm Railway]] is opened)

** [[Salzburg]]–[[Wörgl]]–[[Innsbruck]]
* [[Arlberg railway]]
** Innsbruck–[[Bregenz]] (service is running for [[Stuttgart]] and [[Dortmund]]).
The InterCity service from Vienna to Salzburg is going to be expanded for an hourly service to [[Landeck]] via Innsbruck by December 2008. Also, the service from Vienna to Graz is going to operate hourly by December 2008.

=== Belgium ===
[[File:SNCB Loc 1831 R01 (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|InterCity Genk – Brussels – Brugge – Blankenberge]]
InterCity trains link all major cities of Belgium. Some of them serve also destinations outside the country. The IC between [[Liège]] and [[Brussels]] travels at 200&amp;nbsp;km/h on the [[HSL 2]]. However, because of the density of the train network with many connecting lines and the many small- and medium-sized cities in Belgium, most IC services also call at smaller stations or continue as local trains on branch lines.

=== Croatia ===

[[File:Nagibni 1.jpg|thumbnail|ICN Tilting Train on the Zagreb – Split route]]
InterCity trains in Croatia mainly serve domestic routes from [[Zagreb]] (capital) to [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and from Zagreb to [[Osijek]] except one international train connecting Zagreb and [[Vinkovci]]. Speeds are up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h between [[Slavonski Brod]] and [[Vinkovci]]. The coaches used are similar to the ones used in Germany by DB.

=== Czech Republic ===

In the [[Czech Republic]], the IC or Express trains service the following routes:

*[[Bohumín]]–[[Břeclav]],
*[[Bohumín]]–[[Prague]],
*[[Třinec]]–[[Prague]],
*[[Cheb]]–[[Prague]] (served by [[Supercity Pendolino|Pendolino tilting trainsets]]),
*[[Havířov]]–[[Prague]].

Most of the IC are served by trains of state-owned operator [[České dráhy]] with speeds up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h but they have been converted into category Express in 2012 timetable. The other is served by trains of private operator [[RegioJet]] with speed up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h. No surcharge is applied to IC trains but RegioJet runs reservation compulsory trains. Third private passenger operator [[LEO Express]] introduced express InterCity train service between Prague and Ostrava in November 2012, with speeds up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/passenger/single-view/view/leo-express-carries-first-passengers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The state-owned operator [[České dráhy]] also serves line [[Prague]]–[[Ostrava]] (with some connections extended to [[Bohumín]] and [[Františkovy Lázně]]) with [[Pendolino]] trainsets under designation "''[[Supercity Pendolino|SuperCity]]''", which conforms to IC standard. A compulsory reservation is applied on these trains.

=== Denmark ===
The Intercity network of the [[Danish State Railways]] consists of IC trains and their faster version, ''Lyntog'' (Lightning Train), which is identical but with fewer stops. Each train type operates hourly between the eastern terminus at Copenhagen and westwards to [[Odense]]–[[Århus]]–[[Ålborg]], and less frequently to alternative destinations in [[Jutland]]. These are run by [[IC3]] diesel materiel since most of the network is not electrified. There are also electrical IC trains run by [[IR4]]s in an hourly schedule from Copenhagen westwards to [[Odense]] and alternately [[Esbjerg]]/[[Sønderborg]]. This means during most of the day there are three trains an hour between Copenhagen and Odense. Quite unusual in the world, some trains will consist of both electrically and diesel-powered units coupled together. Being the only option for long-distance and some short-distance travel, there is no surcharge for IC and Lyntog. They have a maximum speed of 180&amp;nbsp;km/h. Additionally, there are a few IR trains during Friday and Sunday peak hours between Copenhagen and Århus. These are locomotive-run and have [[bilevel car]]s. The IC3 trains are planned to be replaced by new [[IC4]] trains, originally in 2001. They first ran with passengers in 2008, but haven't nearly replaced the [[IC3]] yet. It is now planned to give the [[IC3]] stock a 10-year life extension, and to eventually scrap [[IC4]] trains, due to the plague of poor reliability. [[IR4]] stock (Electric version of [[IC3]]) will release [[IC3]] stock from the Esbjerg Line, allowing some IC3 trains to replace [[IC4]] trains.

In Finland, [[VR Group|VR]] has operated InterCity trains between major Finnish cities since August 1988.&lt;ref name="tm-13-1988"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Mannermaisuutta kiskoille | first = Raimo | last = Hämäläinen | journal = Tekniikan Maailma | publisher = [[Otava (publisher)|Yhtyneet Kuvalehdet]] | issue = 13 | year = 1988 | language = Finnish | pages = 42–43 | issn = 0355-4287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vr-ic"&gt;{{cite web | title = InterCity | url = http://www.vr.fi/en/index/palvelut/tietoja_junista/intercity.html | publisher = VR Group | accessdate = 22 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first routes were Helsinki–Vaasa and Helsinki–Imatra,&lt;ref name="tm-13-1988"/&gt; which later expanded to all major cities and include for instance Helsinki–Tampere–Oulu–Rovaniemi, Helsinki–Turku, Helsinki–Iisalmi and Helsinki–Joensuu. InterCity trains have become the standard as the Finnish long-distance rail travel mainstay, and their predecessors, [[VR blue carriages|blue-carriaged]] express trains, are being withdrawn off the schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sss.fi/uutiset/222466.html | title = VR:n siniset junavaunut poistuvat uusien vihreiden vaunujen tieltä | work = Salon Seudun Sanomat | language = Finnish | date = {{date|2011-05-18}} | accessdate = {{date|2011-08-16}} | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120330174728/http://www.sss.fi/uutiset/222466.html | archive-date = 30 March 2012 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The train tickets include an additional surcharge compared to ordinary express trains: 17 to 27% depending on journey length.

VR operates both ordinary InterCity trains (IC) and entirely double-decker trains (IC²).&lt;ref name="vr-ic2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/en/intercity-train|title=InterCity|publisher=VR Group|accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ordinary IC train usually consists of 3 to 4 double-decker cars and 3 to 5 ordinary IC cars. In addition the train has a restaurant car.&lt;ref name="vr-ic"/&gt; IC² trains consist only of double-decker cars and have no separate restaurant car with a sales trolley moving about in the train.&lt;ref name="vr-ic2"/&gt; However, due to high demand, VR ordered double-decker restaurant cars from Transtech in early 2011. The first carriages should be operational in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2011032413426076_uu.shtml | title = VR tilaa kaksikerroksisia ravintolavaunuja | work = [[Suomen Tietotoimisto|STT]] | publisher = [[Iltalehti]] | language = Finnish | date = {{date|2011-03-24}} | accessdate = {{date|2011-08-16}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; All IC-trains are smoke-free.&lt;ref name="vr-ic2"/&gt;

The trains run at a maximum speed of 140–160&amp;nbsp;km/h for single-decker trains&lt;ref name="vr-ic"/&gt; and up to {{convert|200|km/h}} for double-deckers,&lt;ref name="vr-ic2"/&gt; which was VR's aim in 1988.&lt;ref name="tm-13-1988"/&gt; Only the ''[[VR Class Sm3|Pendolino]]'' and ''[[Allegro (train)|Allegro]]'' trains are faster than InterCity trains in Finland.

=== France ===

In 2006, the [[SNCF]] rebranded Corail, Téoz and Lunéa services as '[[Intercités]]', a brand for all of their 'classic' services day and night.

=== Germany ===
{{main|Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)}}

In Germany, the InterCity network was launched in 1971 to accompany and eventually replace the [[Trans Europ Express]] trains. At first, IC services were first-class only, often using TEE stock and the then-new [[DB Class 103|Class 103]] locomotives. Trains ran bi-hourly. DB paid a royalty fee to [[British Rail|BR]] for many years for the use of the [[brand name]].

In 1978, it was decided to expand the IC network to services with both first and second class, and so the new scheme, called '''''IC &lt;nowiki&gt;'79&lt;/nowiki&gt;''''' was launched in 1979 with the motto ''"Jede Stunde, jede Klasse"'' ("every hour, every class") to emphasize its new structure. Large numbers of air-conditioned open coach cars, the ''Bpmz 291'', were built for InterCity services, which at first were using the TEE colour scheme.
In 1985, with many of the TEE trains gone and the introduction of the [[InterRegio]], the network was expanded again, now covering virtually any major city of then-[[West Germany]]. It faced further changes after the [[German reunification]] and the introduction of the [[InterCityExpress]] in the early 1990s.

Today, after the abolition of the InterRegio in 2002, most long-distance connections in Germany are either IC or ICE trains; they most commonly offer at least bi-hourly service. Maximum speed for an IC is 200&amp;nbsp;km/h.

=== Greece ===
In [[Greece]], InterCity trains operated by privately owned [[TrainOSE]] run in the following routes:

* [[Athens]]–[[Leianokladi railway station|Lamia]]–[[Larissa]]–[[Thessaloniki]] (where they will be replaced by the [[FS Class ETR 485|silver arrow]] high-speed trains by 2019), six pairs of trains per day at 160&amp;nbsp;km/h
* [[Athens]]–[[Leianokladi railway station|Lamia]]–[[Palaiofarsalos railway station|Palaiofarsalos]]–[[Karditsa]]–[[Trikala]]–[[Kalambaka]], one pair of trains per day at 160&amp;nbsp;km/h
* [[Thessaloniki]]–[[Serres]]–[[Drama, Greece|Drama]]–[[Xanthi]]-[[Alexandroupoli]], one pair of trains per day at 160&amp;nbsp;km/h

===Hungary===
Intercity train services in Hungary:
* [[Budapest Déli pályaudvar|Budapest Déli pu]]–[[Pécs]] (every 2–3 hours)
* [[Budapest Déli pályaudvar|Budapest Déli pu]]–[[Kaposvár]]–[[Nagykanizsa]] (Somogy IC)
* [[Budapest Déli pályaudvar|Budapest Déli pu.]]-[[Szekszárd]]-[[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] (Gemenc IC)
* [[Budapest Keleti pályaudvar|Budapest Keleti pu]]– [[Miskolc]]–[[Tiszai pályaudvar|Tiszai]]–[[Debrecen]]–[[Budapest Nyugati pályaudvar|Budapest Nyugati pu]] (Circle-IC, every 2 hours)

* [[Budapest Keleti pályaudvar|Budapest Keleti pu]]–[[Győr]]–[[Sopron]] and [[Szombathely]] (every hour)
* [[Budapest Keleti pályaudvar|Budapest Keleti pu]]–[[Békéscsaba]]–[[Timișoara]] /[[Târgu Mureș]]/[[Simeria]]/[[Brașov]]/[[Bucharest North Railway Station|București-Nord]]( (every 2h))
* [[Budapest Keleti pályaudvar|Budapest Keleti pu]]-[[Békéscsaba]]-[[Lőkösháza]] (Every 2–4 hours)
* [[Budapest Nyugati pályaudvar|Budapest Nyugati pu]]–[[Nyíregyháza]] (every 2 hours)
* [[Budapest Nyugati pályaudvar|Budapest Nyugati pu]]–[[Szeged]] (every hour)

The Hungarian intercity trains are operated by MAV-START, the Hungarian railway company.

=== Ireland ===
{{main|InterCity (Iarnród Éireann)}}

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Iarnród Éireann]] introduced the brand name InterCity in 1984, replacing the previous name of ''Mainline'', which had been introduced in 1976. Initially applied to services operated by [[British Rail Mark 3]] trains, it was later extended to include all services not part of the [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] network. Today the brand encompasses services between [[Dublin]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Galway]], [[Limerick]], [[Tralee]], [[Waterford]], [[Sligo]], [[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]], [[Rosslare Europort railway station|Rosslare Europort]], [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]], and [[Ennis]], as well as some regional services. A new InterCity logo was introduced in 2006, though the vast majority of rolling stock bore the original script logo and orange-tan livery until the final Mark 3 set was withdrawn in 2009. Since Ireland completed its replacement of the old Mark 2 and Mark 3 stock in 2012, it has one of the most modern InterCity fleets in the world.

[[Northern Ireland Railways]] and [[Iarnród Éireann]] both formerly operated trains on the [[Dublin]]–[[Belfast]] line under the InterCity brand, however this was replaced with the revived [[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]] brand name upon the introduction of the [[De Dietrich Ferroviaire]] rolling stock in 1997. This, coupled with the subsequent withdrawal of most coaching stock bearing the logo and the rebrand to the Translink name, means that the InterCity brand has largely disappeared from Northern Ireland Railways.

=== Italy ===
[[File:UIC-Z1 semiPilota.jpg|thumb|Trenitalia Intercity]]
In [[Italian Railways|Italy]], InterCity trains constitute a capillary network that links the main cities across the peninsula. There are over 80-day (Intercity) and night (Intercity Notte) services. The major north–south connections are Turin-Lecce (night trains only), Milan-Bari, Bolzano/Bozen-Bari, Venice-Bari, Milan-Rome and Trieste-Naples. In the south, Intercity connections consist of Rome-Palermo, Rome-Bari, Rome-Naples and Rome-Reggio di Calabria. In the north, Intercity connections consist of Turin-Genoa, Milan-Genoa, Milan-Livorno and Venice-Florence.

The fleet consists of first and second class coaches with open-seat or six-seat compartments. Night trains include sleeper coaches of three types: bunk beds for four travellers, two-bed "double" sleeper and one-bed "single" sleeper. There are, however, no showering facilities on any Intercity Notte trains. The newer coaches, called InterCity Plus, have renovated interiors with sockets for PC or mobile phones added to each compartment. However, Excelsior cabins only shown on the Rome To Sicily night train claim to have their own toilet and shower in the cabin, information from Trenitalia web pages:

The Excelsior coaches, available on some night trains offer services comparable to those of a high-level hotel, every vehicle available cabins :
• Single: a cabin with a bed, 
• Double rooms : one twin cabin,
• Doubles: a large suite with double bed with all the amenities.
Each cabin Excelsior E4 instead offers 4 beds for travel from 1 to 4 persons :
Single: a cabin with a bed, 
Doubles : one twin cabin,
Triple : a three-bed cabin
Quadruple : a four-bed cabin
All cabins are equipped with shower and wash basin with private toilet. High cab there is a reception with bar service.
Excelsior single and double cabins are available from all sales channels, while the triple and quadruple only at the ticket and authorized travel agencies.
When travelling in these coaches you must have a personal identification document.

=== Netherlands ===
[[File:Intercitynet NL 2015.png|thumb|left|upright|Dutch Intercity network]]

Intercity trains are very common in the Netherlands, but may differ from each other. While some intercity trains only call at larger stations, some other may also call at smaller stations or at all intermediate stations along a short stretch of its route. Hence, some stations may be served by one intercity train while another may pass it. For example, the Intercity trains between [[Arnhem Centraal railway station|Arnhem Central station]] and [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Utrecht Central station]] alternately serve [[Driebergen-Zeist railway station|Driebergen-Zeist]] or [[Veenendaal-De Klomp railway station|Veenendaal-De Klomp]] (and both when the frequency is lowered from 4tph to 2tph in the evening).  Often, intercity trains run as local trains along the very end of its route. For example, the [[Nijmegen railway station|Nijmegen]] to [[Den Helder railway station|Den Helder]] intercity runs as regular intercity until Alkmaar, serving larger stations only, but running as local train between Alkmaar and Den Helder, serving all intermediate stations.

The average distance between station is smaller than most IC trains in most other countries, but frequencies are higher. All lines are served at least with 2tph, but many busy stretches are served have 4tph. From Utrecht Central there are even two different services to Amsterdam, one that serves the [[Amsterdam Centraal station|central station]] and two others and another that serves the [[Amsterdam Zuid station|south station]] and the [[Schiphol Airport railway station|airport]]. From December 2017 the frequency between Amsterdam, Utrecht and Eindhoven will be further increased to 6tph.

Rolling stock used mostly for intercity services in the Netherlands is [[NS VIRM|VIRM]]. [[NS DD-AR#Modernisation|DD-AR]] trains have been converted to be used as ''New Intercity Double deckers'' and have been introduced to parts of the intercity network. Also, older [[NS Intercity Materieel|ICM]] (formerly known as Koploper) EMUs are frequently seen on intercity routes. [[Trains in the Netherlands#Coaches|ICRm coaches]], pulled by a [[Bombardier TRAXX|TRAXX]] locomotive, can be seen on international stretches and the [[Intercity Direct]].

=== Poland ===
[[File:Pkpintercity.png|frameless|right|InterCity Symbol in Poland]]

In Poland IC trains operated by [[PKP Intercity]] S.A. up to 2009 served the following routes:

* Warsaw–Katowice/Kraków with speed up to 200&amp;nbsp;km/h.
* Warsaw–Katowice–Bielsko-Biała with speed up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Warsaw–Katowice–Gliwice with speed up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Warsaw–Poznań–Wrocław with speed up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Warsaw–Katowice–Opole–Wrocław with speed up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Warsaw–Poznań–Szczecin with speed up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Warsaw–Gdańsk–Gdynia with speed up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Warsaw–Dęblin–Lublin (until 2002) with speed up to 140&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Gdynia–Warsaw–Kraków with speed up to 200&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Gdynia–Warsaw–Gliwice with speed up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Szczecin–Berlin–Amsterdam Zuid WTC–Schiphol (jointly operated by PKP Intercity and [[Deutsche Bahn]])

Apart from a single railway line (line nr 4, a.k.a. Centralna Magistrala Kolejowa–Central Railway Route), average speeds are much lower.

These trains mostly use the locomotive named [[Eurosprinter]] (EU44), [[EP09]], sometimes [[EP08]].

In 2009 IC category was renamed to '''Express InterCity''' ('''EIC''' for short). Since December 2014 IC trains are regular express trains with common pricing offers as TLK trains, also operated by PKP Intercity, mainly utilizing [[Pesa Dart]] (ED161) and [[Stadler FLIRT|Stadler FLIRT&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]] (ED160) [[electric multiple unit]]s. In rare cases trains are served with refurbished cars pulled by [[PKP class EU07|EU07, EP07]] and EP08 locomotives.

=== Portugal ===
In [[Portugal]], InterCidades trains operated by state-owned [[Comboios de Portugal]] (CP) run in the following routes:

* [[Lisbon]]–[[Coimbra]]–[[Porto]]–[[Guimarães]]/[[Braga]] (where they complement the [[Alfa Pendular]] high-speed trains on a one-per-hour schedule), corail coaches at 200&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Lisbon–Coimbra–[[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]], three trains a day with corail coaches at 200&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Lisbon–[[Entroncamento]]–[[Castelo Branco, Portugal|Castelo Branco]]–[[Covilhã]], three trains a day with 5600's engines with Corail coaches, rated for 200&amp;nbsp;km/h, are used. 
* Lisbon–[[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], three (with a fourth train on Friday (Lisbon – Faro), Sunday (Faro – Lisbon) becoming daily both ways in the Summer) at 200&amp;nbsp;km/h. These are complemented by two daily Alfa Pendular runs each way, between Porto, Lisbon and Faro, with a top speed of at 220&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Lisbon-[[Évora]] four trains (three in weekends) with 5600's engines at 200&amp;nbsp;km/h. The connecting [[Beja, Portugal|Beja]] DMU railcar shuttle is also branded IC despite stopping at all stations and having poorer comfort.
*Lisbon-Viana do Castelo, likewise the Lisbon-Évora route it has 4 trains per week with 5600's engines, it was made available by the electrification of the Minho railway until Viana do Castelo. The train runs with corail coaches and reaches 200&amp;nbsp;km/h in some places of the route.

=== Romania ===
Currently InterCity lines link the capital [[Bucharest]] to [[Brașov]], [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], [[Oradea]], [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Târgu Mureș]], [[Galați]] (all once daily), [[Suceava]], [[Iași]] (twice daily), [[Piatra Neamț]] (once daily), [[Bacău]] (4x daily), [[Ploiești]] (6x daily), [[Craiova]] (twice daily) and [[Timișoara]] (once daily). There are also international trains branded as InterCity between the Hungarian capital, [[Budapest]] and some [[Transylvania]]n cities such as [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Târgu Mureș]], [[Brașov]], and others. These trains usually have specific names ([[Harghita]], [[Ady Endre]], etc.).

In the case of IC service running partially or totally on electrified lines as well as international IC-s locomotive-hauled trains are used. For some trains running exclusively on unelectrified lines (mainly in northern [[Transilvania]]) [[Siemens Desiro]] DMU-s are preferred. These trainsets look similar to standard Desiro DMU-s used for regional trains but have a different interior design with more comfortable seating.

All IC trains use 1st and 2nd class coaches with air conditioning, having automatic doors and a higher level of comfort than InterRegio trains. In order to compete with regional airlines, [[CFR Călători]] introduced special '''Business class''' coaches on the IC trains running between [[Oradea]] and [[Bucharest]] and [[Timișoara]] and [[Bucharest]]. The new class can be divided into two slightly different premium service levels, ''Business Exclusiv'' (1A) and ''Business Standard'' (1B). All of these coaches have wireless internet and wall sockets in order to permit the use of laptops, 4 channel audio system, bar, Exclusiv further providing larger space per customer, special leather seating and LCD screens for each seat.

Maximum speed is 140&amp;nbsp;km/h on Bucharest-Campina, 120&amp;nbsp;km/h on all other lines.

=== Serbia===
Currently InterCity lines link the capital [[Belgrade]] to [[Novi Sad]], [[Subotica]] and [[Prijepolje]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zeleznicesrbije.com/active/sr-latin/home/glavna_navigacija/putnicki_saobracaj/inter_siti_srbija.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723042712/http://www.zeleznicesrbije.com/active/sr-latin/home/glavna_navigacija/putnicki_saobracaj/inter_siti_srbija.html |archive-date=23 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slovakia ===

{{Update|reason=it is missing the [[RegioJet]] vs [[ZSSK]] InterCity wars, the cancellation of the InterCity services by ZSSK etc|date=May 2018}}
In the [[Slovak Republic]], InterCity trains run between the capital [[Bratislava]] and [[Košice]] (some IC trains continued from Bratislava to [[Vienna]]). In the past, the names of some of these trains used to be sold for commercial use (IC [[Šariš]] named by beer producer, IC [[Zelmer]] named by an electronic devices producer, IC [[Slovenka (magazine)|Slovenka]] named by a magazine, IC Mora, IC Gorenje, both named after kitchen appliances producers). In 2012, no IC train had commercial name. All IC trains are named by natural monuments (IC Tatran, IC Kriváň, IC Gerlach, IC Rysy, IC Chopok, IC Ďumbier). All IC trains are subject to [[compulsory reservation]] to make comfort as high as possible. The seat reservation is included in the ticket price. The price varies, depending on the day of travel, and the time of reservation (the sooner you buy a ticket, the lower the price).

In the past, there were also 3 other InterCity services: IC 400/407 Donau (Danube) between Bratislava and Vienna, IC 532/533 [[Rákoczi]] from Košice to [[Budapest]] and IC 536/537 [[Hornád]] from Košice to [[Pécs]]. On this train passengers could travel without a reservation or surcharge, since it is impossible to use them for domestic transport in Slovakia.

All InterCity trains consist of new comfortable [[passenger car (rail)|car]]s which are fully [[Air conditioning|air conditioned]].

[[First class travel#Railways|First class]] and a [[restaurant car]] are available on all IC trains.

Maximum speed between [[Bratislava]] and [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]] has been increased in the recent years and is now 160&amp;nbsp;km/h. On the rest of the route, maximum speed varies from 80 to 140&amp;nbsp;km/h.
There is a large reconstruction under way between Nové Mesto nad Váhom and Žilina. After the reconstruction is finished, it will be possible to increase maximum speed of this part of the route to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h.

=== Slovenia ===
Intercity trains in Slovenia mainly serve domestic routes, like running from Ljubljana (capital) to Celje, Ptuj, and Maribor. Comfort in Slovenian Intercity trains is not as good as in other countries. Coaches serving main routes are usually old. Some IC trains do not offer first class and restaurant carriage. The type of cars is basically the same as the cars of ÖBB, however, the cars are slightly older with no sign of renovation. Additionally, there are also available older Pendolino electric multiple tilting units ETR 310 (SŽ series 310) labeled as ICS lines connecting Slovenian largest cities, Ljubljana and Maribor and the Mediterranean region of Slovenia, Koper.

===Spain===
[[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]] operates intercity trains in Spain. It was a long-distance train with high frequency. This denomination was created firstly in 1980. It started operating the [[Electric multiple unit|electric train (EMU)]] Renfe 444 series, making the [[Madrid]] [[Valencia|-Valencia]] vía [[Albacete]] line. It was capable of doing 140&amp;nbsp;km/h (87&amp;nbsp;mph).

In 1986 it expanded to [[Barcelona]] and Zaragoza, it was capable of doing 160&amp;nbsp;km/h (99&amp;nbsp;mph). In 1987 Renfe received new 448 series electric trains, those also being capable of doing 160&amp;nbsp;km/h. In the main lines this service was combined with fast trains or Talgos. In the less used lines it was a once a day train, as daily fast train. The last line was [[Irún]] [[Madrid|-Madrid]], operated by a 448 series. This service closed in 2008.

In 2012 they opened new lines with the same denomination, making medium and long-distance routes.

The main differences between this line and the other ones is that it has more stops, trains stop in some lines every 15 minutes or less.&lt;ref&gt;(In Spanish)http://www.farodevigo.es/gran-vigo/2012/06/15/renfe-estrena-tren-vigo-madrid-diez-horas-paradas-15-minutos/657145.html&lt;/ref&gt;
This service can be divided in 3 categories: &lt;br/&gt;
-New lines using old Medium distance tracks, but with more stops. &lt;br/&gt; -Long-distance routes with intercity [[fares]]. &lt;br/&gt; -Old MD (Medium distance) lines, some of them are two older MD lines together.&lt;ref&gt;Most of this article was a translation from the Spanish version https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercity_(Renfe)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
[[File:InterCity at Falköping train station Sweden.jpg|thumb|An InterCity train in [[Falköping]], [[Sweden]]]]
[[File:Flemingsberg station 2018.jpg|thumb|An InterCity train in [[Flemingsberg]], [[Stockholm]]]]
During the 1980s, InterCity denoted trains of the highest standard in Sweden, serving as a fast and comfortable connection between major Swedish cities. Trains used to be set up of the most modern cars, always including a restaurant car. During the 1990s the [[SJ AB|Swedish State Railways]] introduced the new [[X 2000]] units which replaced the InterCity trains in this role. Since then, the InterCity trains serve an auxiliary role, calling at smaller stations and providing a cheaper alternative for the costly X 2000. They are set up of modernised cars pulled by [[SJ Rc|Rc6 locomotives]] with a maximum speed of 160&amp;nbsp;km/h. They serve the following lines:
*[[Stockholm]] – [[Arlanda]] – [[Uppsala]] – [[Sala, Sweden|Sala]] – [[Avesta]] – [[Hedemora]] – [[Säter]] – [[Borlänge]] – [[Falun]]. Some trains continue from Borlänge via [[Gagnef]] – [[Leksand]] – [[Rättvik]] towards [[Mora, Sweden|Mora]];
*[[Stockholm]] – [[Arlanda]] – [[Uppsala]] – [[Gävle]] – [[Ljusdal]] – [[Ånge]] – [[Bräcke]] – [[Östersund]] – [[Åre]] – [[Duved, Sweden|Duved]];
*[[Stockholm]] – [[Arlanda]] – [[Uppsala]] – [[Gävle]] – [[Söderhamn]] – [[Hudiksvall]] – [[Sundsvall]];
*[[Stockholm]] – [[Södertälje]] – [[Hallsberg]] – [[Skövde]] – [[Herrljunga]] – [[Gothenburg]];
*[[Stockholm]] – [[Södertälje]] – [[Norrköping]] – [[Linköping]] – [[Nässjö]] – [[Hässleholm]] – [[Lund]] – [[Malmö]];
*[[Gothenburg]] – [[Varberg]] – [[Falkenberg]] – [[Halmstad]] – [[Hässleholm]] – [[Lund]] – [[Malmö]];
*[[Luleå]] – [[Boden, Sweden|Boden]] – [[Gällivare]] – [[Kiruna]] – [[Narvik]].
Apart from the SJ, there are other train operators in Sweden who also run trains of a similar type. Only SJ, however, uses the name "InterCity".

=== Switzerland ===

[[File:SBB IC Bt Oberbuchsiten - Oensingen.jpg|thumb|200px|An InterCity train that consists of refurbished standard type IV carriages with the [[control car]] leading the train]]
Swiss InterCity services started in 1982, replacing the [[Swiss Express]] on the line Geneva-St. Gallen. There is no surcharge for InterCity services in Switzerland and the rolling stock consists of three types of formations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mct.sbb.ch/mct/en/reisemarkt/services/im-zug/zuege/zuege-fernverkehr.htm|title=SBB: Trains – Long-distance traffic|accessdate=24 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815101446/http://mct.sbb.ch/mct/en/reisemarkt/services/im-zug/zuege/zuege-fernverkehr.htm|archive-date=15 August 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Standard type IV carriages ({{lang-de|EW IV}}, Einheitswagen IV) and driving trailers of type IC, the same as on [[InterRegio]] services. A normal train composition consists of a [[Re 460]] locomotive, 8 to 12 carriages and a driving trailer. Seating capacity is up to 900, depending on the train composition. Most carriages have a small compartment for storing bicycles and/or skis at one end of the carriage; this end is marked by a bicycle drawn on the outside of the closest doors. The type IV carriages are the least wheelchair friendly as they require climbing the stairs to enter. Overall, 533 carriages and driving trailers are in operation.
* Double-decker [[IC 2000]] carriages for lines with heavy commuter load. These trains are also powered by a [[Re 460]] locomotive, can be composed of up to 9 carriages with one driving trailer and offer close to 1,000 seats. At present, about 320 carriages are in use.
* A [[tilting train]] category called [[SBB-CFF-FFS RABDe 500|ICN]] for lines with many curves. These trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s and hence require no locomotive. One such multiple unit consists of 7 carriages and has a [[seating capacity]] of 480 passengers: 125 in first class, 332 in second class, and 23 in the dining car (which is part of second class). The fleet of ICN trains comprise 44 units.
If needed, two ICN trains can be combined to double the passenger capacity. In addition, several type IV carriages can be attached to an IC 2000 train set on the other side of the locomotive, especially if a group reservation requires extra carriages.

All carriages are air conditioned. Each train formation has first and second class carriages and, in most cases, a restaurant/bistro carriage. The availability of power sockets is constantly improved, sometimes even in second class. The maximal speed of all train types is 200&amp;nbsp;km/h, except for about half of type IV carriages that have not yet been upgraded and have a maximum speed of 160&amp;nbsp;km/h.

InterCity trains serve most of Swiss cities and provide direct connections from Zurich and Geneva airports. The InterCity routes within Switzerland according to 2009–2010 schedule include:
* Lugano – Bellinzona – Arth-Goldau – Luzern -  Zug – Zürich HB;
* Interlaken Ost – Interlaken West – ( Därligen – Leissigen – Faulensee ) – Spiez – Thun – ( Münsingen ) – Bern – Olten – ( Liestal ) – Basel SBB;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|InterCity (British Rail)}}

The term "Inter-City" was first used by state railway company [[British Rail]] in 1966, to [[British Rail brand names|brand]] all its longer-distance, higher-speed services (the hyphen was dropped shortly afterwards, changing the name to "InterCity"). The brand was closely associated with a new design of carriage, the [[British Rail Mark 2|Mark 2]] which revolutionised levels of comfort on the system. The system was hugely successful and became one of the world's few profitable public railway services.

Today, Britain's railways having been privatised, InterCity trains in the UK are operated by many different train companies including [[Abellio Greater Anglia]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[CrossCountry]], [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]], [[London North Eastern Railway]], [[East Midlands Railway]], [[Hull Trains]] and [[Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central]]. Most of these companies operate their services from one of the many London termini, with [[CrossCountry]] being the exception, running from [[Cornwall]] to [[Scotland]]. If travelling via London it is often necessary to change stations: a journey from [[Norwich]] to [[Cardiff]] would require a transfer from [[Liverpool Street station|London Liverpool Street]] to [[London Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] station via the [[London Underground]].

Currently, InterCity trains in United Kingdom use [[InterCity 125]] (Class 43 power car + 8/9 Mark 3 coaches, also named as HST), [[InterCity 225]] (Class 91 + 9 Mark 4 coaches), [[British Rail Class 90|Class 90]] + 8/9 Mark 3 coaches + [[Driving Van Trailer]], [[Bombardier Voyager family|Voyager family]] classes [[British Rail Class 220|220]], [[British Rail Class 221|221]] &amp; [[British Rail Class 222|222]] (4–7 coach DEMUs), [[British Rail Class 180|class 180]] (5 coach DMUs) and [[British Rail Class 390|class 390]] (9 or 11 coach EMUs) on the Intercity lines.

The British Government have named their project to replace the [[InterCity 125]] as the [[Intercity Express Programme]].

[[File:SNIM ore train Nouadhibou.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mauritania Railway]] iron ore train at the station in [[Nouadhibou]].]]

The length of a [[train]], including the '''longest trains''', may be measured in number of [[Railroad car|wagons]] (for bulk loads such as [[coal]] and [[iron ore]]) or in [[metres]] for general freight. Train lengths and loads on electrified railways, especially lower voltage [[3000 V DC]] and [[1500 V DC]], are limited by traction power considerations. Drawgear and [[Railway coupling|couplings]] can be a limiting factor, tied in with curves, gradients and crossing loop lengths.

Conventional freight trains in the US can average nearly {{convert|2,000|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Popular Mechanics|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/extreme-machines/4345689|title=Is Bigger Better? 'Monster' Trains vs Freight Trains|first=Stephen|last=Joiner|date=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freight trains with a total length of three or four times that average are possible with the advent of [[distributed power]], or additional locomotive units between or behind long chains of freight cars (referred to as a "consist"). Locomotive units enable much longer, heavier loads without the increased risks of derailing that stem from the stress of pulling very long chains of train-cars around curves.

The '''Hungarian Gold Train''' was the German-operated train during [[World War II]] that carried stolen valuables, mostly Hungarian [[Jews]]' property, from [[Hungary]] towards [[Berlin]] in 1945. After [[Seventh United States Army|American forces]] seized the train in Austria, almost none of the valuables were returned to Hungary, their rightful owners, or their surviving family members.&lt;ref name = "PAC"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Mystery of the Hungarian "Gold Train"|url= http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/pcha/goldtrainfinaltoconvert.html|publisher= Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States |author=Art Research Staff|date=October 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CNN"&gt;{{cite news |title= Nazis and the mysterious 'Gold Train |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/books/10/30/gold.train/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] | first= Adam |last=Dunn|date= October 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
With the Soviet Army about {{convert|100|mi|km|order=flip}} away from Hungary, on March 7, 1944, [[Adolf Hitler]] launched [[Operation Margarethe]]—the invasion of Hungary. The [[Arrow Cross Party]] – Hungary's [[fascist]] government, led by [[Ferenc Szálasi]] – collaborated with their German occupiers in forcing the estimated 800,000 Jewish citizens of Hungary to hand over all of their valuables to government officials. This included gems, gold jewelry, wedding rings, and anything else considered to be of high monetary value. The confiscated property was placed into individual bags and boxes which identified the owners, and receipts were issued. The majority of the Jews were shipped to concentration camps, particularly [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]]; most were murdered. The Hungarian authorities re-sorted all the confiscated valuables into content categories. By that time it was all but impossible to identify proper ownership of any of the valuables.&lt;ref name = "PAC"/&gt;

==The "Gold Train"==
[[Image:German WWII Frieght Train.jpg|thumb|250px|Undated photo of a German freight train during World War II.]]In late 1944, the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] was advancing on the Hungarian capital of [[Budapest]].  A government official appointed by the [[Schutzstaffel|''Schutzstaffel'' (SS)]], Árpád Toldi,  concocted a plan to evacuate much of the Jewish loot out of Hungary.  Toldi ordered large amounts of the valuables onto a 46-car [[freight train]] with 213 people on board that was to head for Nazi Germany via Austria:

*24 cars to carry the confiscated and looted items
*15 cars to carry Hungarian and Nazi Germany troops guarding the train, plus their supplies of ammunition, food &amp; drink
*7 cars to carry a designated group of coal miners, who were there to bury the items should need arise

According to various reports about the train, the contents included gold, gold jewelry, gems, diamonds, pearls, watches, about 200 paintings, Persian and Oriental rugs, silverware, chinaware, furniture, fine clothing, linens, porcelains, cameras, stamp-collections and currency (mostly US dollars and [[Swiss francs]]). As the train meandered through Hungary, it stopped at a few locations to collect other looted and confiscated items that had been stored elsewhere, including a stop close to [[Abaúj Castle]]. On reaching a considered safe location close to the Hungarian/Austrian border, Toldi halted the train for 92 days to carefully document what he catalogued as Hungarian Government property. Jewish organizations and the Hungarian government estimated the total value of the train's contents at $350 million in 1945&lt;ref name = "CNN"/&gt; or almost $4 billion in 2007 adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref name = "USDOL"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bureau of Labor Statistics|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/ |publisher= [[United States Department of Labor]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates of the contents' 1945 worth are from $50 million to $120 million &lt;ref name="TheHill"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawmakers Angry Over Slow Track of ‘Gold Train’ Case |url=http://www.house.gov/schakowsky/Article_11_12_03_Gold_Train.html |newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |first=Jonathan E. |last=Kaplan |date=November 12, 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501171404/http://www.house.gov/schakowsky/Article_11_12_03_Gold_Train.html |archivedate=May 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or $570 million to $1.7 billion in 2007 adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref name = "USDOL"/&gt;

In Spring 1945, the train started its journey west again. Toldi and his family left the train with a large amount of gold on 30 March 1945, as the train crossed into Austria - the Russian Army was only {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} behind. Toldi's convoy tried to enter neutral [[Switzerland]] 10 days later, but were refused entry. Toldi then turned to SS officer [[Wilhelm Höttl]], to whom he handed over 10% of his convoy's goods (4 cases of gold) in return for both German passports and Swiss visas for all of his family. Toldi and his family then successfully entered Switzerland, but he was later detained in Austria that year, interogated by Allied authorities, but released and has never been traced again.

After passing from Hungary directly into [[Austria]], the train stopped occasionally to transfer amounts of the gold to trucks. The fate of the gold on those trucks remains unknown. The train eventually came to a halt in the town of [[Werfen]], best known for the medieval [[Hohenwerfen Castle]], on 16 May 1945 post the surrender of Nazi Germany. There it was seized by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops, first by the [[French Army]] and then by the [[United States Army]].

==Fate of valuables==
The official United States asset [[restitution]] policy agreed upon at the 1946 Final Act of Paris Reparation Conference and by the Five-Power Agreement for Non-Repatriable Victims of Germany was to sell ownerless property for the benefit of non-repatriable refugees. These agreements were the basis for the creation of the Preparatory Committee for the [[International Refugee Organization]] (IRO).&lt;ref name = "PAC"/&gt;

The US had a different policy towards works of art. In accordance with long-standing international agreements, the US had a policy of restitution that "looted works of art and cultural material will be restituted to the governments of the countries from which they were taken."&lt;ref name="PAC"/&gt;

The US Army [[Counter Intelligence Corps|Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC)]] sent their officer Morton Himmler, who was stationed in [[Salzburg]], to take charge of what they referred to as the '''Werfen Train'''. Himmler ordered the people on board to be immediately detained and separated from the train, although the US Army which was short of personnel allowed selected Hungarian troops to assist in unloading the train. Meanwhile, the Central Board of Jews in Hungary - an organization representing Jewish interests in Hungary, and under pressure from the occupying Soviet Army who were seeking war repatriations - and the new government of Hungary, were aware of the American seizure of the train and lobbied extensively, and sometimes passionately, for the return of all the contents of the train to Hungary where they could be sorted out in an effort to return them to their rightful owners or their family members. The US Government continually ignored the Hungarian pleas.&lt;ref name="PAC"/&gt;

The US Army transferred the majority of the assets to a Military Government Warehouse in [[Salzburg]]. The paintings, however, were stored in the [[Salzburg Residenz]]. As ownership of the valuables was impossible to ascertain, the official US position, as stipulated by United States Army Chief of Staff [[George C. Marshall]], was that the belongings were to be given to refugee aid organizations in accordance with international restitution agreements.&lt;ref name="PAC"/&gt;

The majority of the remaining assets from the train was either sold through [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service|Army exchange stores]] in Europe in 1946 or auctioned off in [[New York City]] in 1948, with the proceeds going to the IRO. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' the auction receipts totaled $152,850.61, or approximately $1.3 million in 2007 adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref name = "USDOL"/&gt; Items of clothing allocated for Army exchange store sales that were considered of lesser value were turned over to a Division [[chaplain]] for distribution "to needy DPs" ([[displaced person]]s).&lt;ref name = "PAC"/&gt;

Some of the property from the train ended up in the possession of high-ranking US Army officers who were stationed in Central Europe to oversee post-war and [[Marshall Plan]] reconstruction efforts. By requisition order of Major General [[Harry J. Collins]], Commander of the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] (the famed "Rainbow" Division), many of the items were used to furnish his home. Other items furnished the homes and offices of other US military officers including [[Brigadier General]] [[Henning Linden]] and General [[Edgar Erskine Hume|Edgar E. Hume]]. The property included chinaware, silverware, glassware, rugs, and table and bed linen.&lt;ref name = "PAC"/&gt;

The ultimate fate of approximately 200 paintings seized from the train is unknown. As they were deemed "cultural assets" under official US restitution policy, they should have been returned to their country of origin. That country should have been Hungary, but as of 1953 the paintings were in the possession of the Austrian government;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-mystery-of-the-hungarian-gold-train#en72 Jewish virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt; their current whereabouts is unknown.&lt;ref name = "PAC"/&gt;

==Developments since 1998==
{{Update-section|date=March 2018}}

The United States government kept most of the details of the Hungarian Gold Train secret from the public until 1998, when US President [[Bill Clinton]] created the [[Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States]].  A report prepared by the committee, published in October 1999, detailed the handling of the train's assets by the United States and cited a multitude of "shortcomings" of the US restitution efforts in Austria that eventually led to the property from the Hungarian Gold Train being so readily dispersed by United States officials. It concluded that the application of several policies regarding many assets on the train ensured that they were never returned to their rightful owners.&lt;ref name = "USAToday"&gt;{{cite news |title= U.S. settles 'Gold Train' Holocaust claims |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-12-20-gold-train_x.htm |publisher=Associated Press / [[USA Today]] |date= December 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Hungarian [[Holocaust]] survivors filed a lawsuit in a [[Florida]] district court against the United States government for the government's mishandling of the assets on the Hungarian Gold Train. David Mermelstein was the only survivor present at the mediation. In 2005, the government reached a settlement worth $25.5 million.  The money was allocated for distribution to various Jewish social service agencies for the benefit of Holocaust survivors.&lt;ref name = "AP"&gt;{{cite news |title= Settlement in WWII 'Gold Train' Theft |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28122-2005Mar11?language=printer |publisher= [[Associated Press]] / [[The Washington Post]]|date=March 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "JVL"&gt;{{cite news |title= U.S. settles 'Gold Train' Holocaust claims |url= http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/goldtrain1.html |publisher=Associated Press / [[Jewish Virtual Library]] |date= December 20, 2004 – September 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the items of evidence submitted by attorneys who represented the survivors was a January 1949 letter written by [[Evelyn Tucker]], a fine arts officer serving with the United States' [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) program]] who had been assigned to the Reparation, Deliveries and Restitution (RD&amp;R) Branch of the U.S. Allied Command, Austria (USACA). Sent to U.S. State Department cultural affairs officer [[Ardelia Ripley Hall]], Tucker's letter documented the post-World War II looting by U.S. Army officers of multiple items from former Nazi strongholds, including items from the gold train.&lt;ref&gt;ONeill, Ann.

A '''road train''', '''land train''' or '''long combination vehicle''' is a [[truck]]ing vehicle of a type used in rural and remote areas of [[Australia]] and in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], to move road [[freight]] more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advantia.com.au/rob-di-cristoforo/the-productivity-squeeze-in-australian-road-transport/ |title=The productivity squeeze in Australian road transport |publisher=[[Advantia Transport Consulting]] |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two or more trailers or semi-trailers hauled by a [[tractor unit|prime mover]].&lt;ref name=definitions&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vintageroadhaulage.com.au/faq/what-is-a-road-train/ |title= What is a Road Train? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2018 |website= X |publisher= Vintage Road Haulage, Perth, Western Australia |access-date= 4 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long combination vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.testquestionsandanswers.com/cdl/combination-vehicles-test.html |title=CDL Combination Vehicles Endorsement Practice Test |website=TestQuestionsAndAnswers.com |publisher=National Safety Commission, Inc. |location=US |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are combinations of multiple [[Semi-trailer truck|trailers]] on tractor trucks as compared to standard 5 axle semi trailer-trucks with one trailer.

== History ==
Early road trains consisted of [[traction engine]]s pulling multiple wagons. The first identified road trains operated into [[South Australia]]'s [[Flinders Ranges]] from the [[Port Augusta]] area in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Basil|title=The Ghan: The Story of the Alice Springs Railway|date=1975|publisher=Rigby|isbn=978-0727000163}}&lt;/ref&gt; They displaced bullock teams for the carriage of minerals to port and were, in turn, superseded by railways.

During the [[Crimean War]], a traction engine was used to pull multiple open trucks.&lt;ref name=Beavan-217&gt;{{cite book|last=Beavan|first=Arthur H.|title=Tube, Train, Tram, and Car or Up-to-date Locomotion|year=1903|publisher=G. Routledge &amp; sons|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/tubetraintramcar00beavrich#page/216/mode/2up|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1898 steam traction engine trains with up to four wagons were employed in military manoeuvres in England.&lt;ref name=war-20&gt;{{cite book|title=Mechanical traction in war for road transport, with notes on automobiles generally|year=1900|publisher=S.

In 1900, [[John Fowler &amp; Co.]] provided armoured road trains for use by the [[British Armed Forces]] in the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name=Beavan-217/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated war news|url=https://archive.org/stream/nsillustratedwar03londuoft#page/10/mode/1up|date=29 November 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] stated that he had around 45 steam road trains at his disposal.&lt;ref name=wyatt-43&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyatt|first=Horace Matthew|title=Motor transports in war|year=1914|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|url=https://archive.org/stream/motortransportsi00wyatrich#page/43|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A road train devised by Captain [[Charles Renard]] of the French Engineering Corps was displayed at the 1903 Paris Salon. After his death, [[Daimler Company|Daimler]], which had acquired the rights, attempted to market it in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/4752385/A-good-idea-at-the-time-Renard-Road-Train.html|title=A good idea at the time: Renard Road Train|last=Burgess-Wise|first=David|date=2001-08-17|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fm4nAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=1907%20%22the%20auto%22%20road%20train&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q=1907%20%22the%20auto%22%20road%20train&amp;f=false|title=The Auto: The Motorist's Pictorial|last=Spooner|first=Stanley|date=1907|publisher=Pictorial Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of these vehicles were successfully delivered to [[Queensland]], Australia, before the company ceased production upon the start of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farinarestoration.com/page4/page81/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s/40s, the government of Australia operated an [[AEC Roadtrain]] to transport freight and supplies into the Northern Territory, replacing the [[Afghan (Australia)|Afghan]] [[camel]] trains that had been trekking through the deserts since the late 19th century. This truck pulled two or three {{convert|6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} Dyson four-axle self-tracking trailers. At {{convert|130|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}}, the AEC was grossly underpowered by today's standards, and drivers and offsiders (a partner or assistant) routinely froze in winter and sweltered in summer due to the truck's open cab design and the position of the engine radiator, with its {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} cooling fan, behind the seats.

Australian [[Kurt Johannsen (bush mechanic)|Kurt Johannsen]], a bush mechanic, is recognised as the inventor of the modern road train.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/history/hindsight/features/north/epis_4.htm View From The North - Episode Four: Roads North&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|Double bottoms were in use long before this.|date=December 2016}} After transporting stud bulls {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} to an [[outback]] property, Johannsen was challenged to build a truck to carry 100 head of [[cattle]] instead of the original load of 20. Provided with financing of about 2000 [[Australian pound|pound]]s and inspired by the tracking abilities of the Government roadtrain, Johannsen began construction. Two years later his first road train was running.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Worldwide]], [[Jeremy Clarkson's Motorworld]], Australian episode&lt;/ref&gt;

Johannsen's first road train&lt;!--is it 1 word, 2, or hyphenated...?--&gt; consisted of a [[United States Army]] [[World War II]] surplus [[Diamond T tank transporter|Diamond-T tank carrier]], nicknamed "Bertha", and two home-built self-tracking trailers. Both wheel sets on each trailer could steer, and therefore could negotiate the tight and narrow tracks and creek crossings that existed throughout [[Central Australia]] in the earlier part of the 20th century. Freighter Trailers in Australia viewed this improved invention and went on to build self-tracking trailers for Kurt and other customers, and went on to become innovators in transport machinery for Australia.

This first example of the modern road train, along with the AEC Government Roadtrain, forms part of the huge collection at the [[National Road Transport Hall of Fame]] in [[Alice Springs]], [[Northern Territory]].

== Usage ==
=== Australia ===
[[File:Road_Train2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[BP]] 4-trailer road train in the Australian outback with a [[Volvo Trucks|Volvo]] NH15 prime mover.]]
The term ''road train'' is used in Australia. In contrast with a more common semi-trailer towing one [[trailer (vehicle)#Full trailer|trailer]] or [[semi-trailer]], the [[tractor unit|prime mover]] of a road train hauls two or more trailers or semi-trailers. Australia has the longest and heaviest road-legal road trains in the world, weighing up to 200 tonnes. They transport freight across some of the harshest environments on Earth.&lt;ref name=definitions/&gt;

'''Double''' (two-trailer) road train combinations are allowed on some roads in most states of Australia, including specified approaches to the ports and industrial areas of [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]&lt;ref name="RAVnet"/&gt; and [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/UsingRoads/HeavyVehicles/Pages/HeavyVehiclesHome.aspx |title=Heavy Vehicles |publisher=[[Main Roads Western Australia]] |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A double road train should not be confused with a [[B-double]], which is allowed access to most of the country and in all major cities.&lt;ref name="Hema Maps 2007"&gt;Hema Maps (Firm) &amp; Martin, Ray. &amp; Martin, Will. (2007), Australia truckies atlas [cartographic material] : the complete atlas for the professional driver / Hema Maps ; [cartography, Ray Martin and Will Martin] - {{ISBN|978-1-86500-426-6}} {{ISBN|1-865004-26-X}} - has state by state routes and route restrictions I&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Australia, B-triples up to {{convert|35.0|m}} and two-trailer road trains to {{convert|36.5|m}} were only permitted to travel on a small number of approved routes in the north and west of the state, including access to Adelaide's north-western suburban industrial and export areas such as [[Port Adelaide]], [[Gillman, South Australia|Gillman]] and [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbour]] via [[Salisbury Highway]], [[Port Wakefield Road]] and [[Augusta Highway]] before 2017.&lt;ref name="RAVnet"&gt;{{cite map |url=http://maps.sa.gov.au/ravnet/index.html |title=RAVnet |publisher=[[Government of South Australia]] |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A project named ''Improving Road Transport for the Agriculture Industry'' added {{convert|7200|km}} of key routes permitted to operate vehicles over 30m in 2015–2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/311132/Improving_Road_Transport_for_Primary_Production_Status_Update_-_web.pdf |title=IMPROVING ROAD TRANSPORT FOR PRIMARY PRODUCTION PROJECT Status update |date=February 2018 |publisher=[[Primary Industries and Regions SA]] |accessdate=24 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triple''' (three-trailer) road trains operate in western [[New South Wales]], western [[Queensland]], South Australia, Western Australia and the [[Northern Territory]], with the last three states also allowing AB-quads (B double with two additional trailers coupled behind). [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] is the only capital city in the world where triples and quads are allowed to within {{convert|1|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of the [[central business district]] (CBD).&lt;ref name="Hema Maps 2007"/&gt;

Strict regulations regarding licensing, registration, weights, and experience apply to all operators of road trains throughout Australia.

Road trains are used for transporting all manner of materials: common examples are [[livestock]], [[fuel]], mineral [[ore]]s, and general freight. Their cost-effective transport has played a significant part in the economic development of remote areas; some communities are totally reliant on regular service.

The multiple [[Road train#Dog-trailer .28Pup trailer.29|dog-trailers]] are unhooked, the [[dolly (trailer)|dollies]] removed and then connected individually to multiple trucks at "assembly" yards when the road train gets close to populated areas.

When the flat-top trailers of a road train need to be transported empty, it is common practice to stack them. This is commonly referred to as "doubled-up" or "doubling-up". Sometimes, if many trailers are required to be moved at one time, they will be triple-stacked, or "tripled-up".

Higher Mass Limits (HML) Schemes are now in all jurisdictions in Australia, allowing trucks to carry additional weight beyond general mass limits. Some roads in some states regularly allowing up to 4 trailers at {{convert|53.5|m|ft}} long and 136 Ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nhvr.gov.au/files/201707-0577-common-heavy-freight-vehicles-combinations.pdf |title=Common Heavy Freight Vehicle Configurations - NHVR |publisher= National Heavy Vehicle Regulator |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, trucks on public roads are limited to two trailers (two {{convert|28|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} and a dolly to connect; the limit is {{convert|63|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} end to end). Some states allow three trailers, although triples are usually restricted to less populous states such as Idaho, Oregon, and Montana, plus the [[Ohio Turnpike]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://statepatrol.ohio.gov/doc/truckbook.pdf "Truck Driver's Guide Book"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indiana East-West Toll Road]]. Triples are used for long-distance [[Less than truckload|less-than-truckload]] freight hauling (in which case the trailers are shorter than a typical single-unit trailer) or resource hauling in the interior west (such as [[ore]] or [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]). Triples are sometimes marked with "LONG LOAD" banners both front and rear. "Turnpike doubles"—tractors towing two full-length trailers—are allowed on the [[New York Thruway]] and [[Mass Pike|Massachusetts Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 90]]), [[Florida's Turnpike]], [[Kansas Turnpike]] (Kansas City - Wichita route) as well as the [[Ohio]] and [[Indiana]] toll roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Fact #411 States that Allow Longer Combination Vehicles | date=13 February 2006 | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy - Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Vehicle Technologies Office | url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2006_fcvt_fotw411.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "road train" is not commonly used in the United States; "turnpike train" has been used, generally in a pejorative sense.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&amp;dat=19601027&amp;id=CvQZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RCMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5552,3153037 Gangway! Here comes a turnpike train!]", ''The Times-News'' (Hendersonville, N.C.), 30 Nov. 1960, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the western United States LCVs are allowed on many [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate]] highways. The only LCVs allowed nationwide are [[STAA doubles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/tswstudy/Vol3-Chapter3.pdf |title=Comprehensive Truck Size and Weight (CTS&amp;W) Study |volume=Volume 3 |chapter=Chapter 3: Scenario Descriptions |publisher=Department of Transportation - Federal Highway Administration |location=US |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
[[File:A B-double unloading timber at Pellets Asturias, Tineo, on 7 Nov 2019.jpg|thumb|right]]In [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], and some roads in [[Norway]], trucks with trailers are allowed to be {{convert|25.25|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Effektive og miljørigtige lastbiler på de danske veje|date=24 November 2008|publisher=Transport og Energiministeriet|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214233953/http://www.trm.dk/sw43883.asp?path={D917AC55-C794-45B6-9F72-31A9927A7F59}|language=Danish|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214233953/http://www.trm.dk/sw43883.asp?path=%7BD917AC55-C794-45B6-9F72-31A9927A7F59%7D|archive-date=14 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland {{convert|34.5|m|ft}} is allowed since January 2019, but the longest vehicles are {{convert|31.5|m|ft}} long because of cornering regulations. Elsewhere in the [[European Union]], the limit is {{convert|18.75|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} (Norway {{convert|19.5|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The trucks are of a cab-over-engine design. These have a flat front and a high floor about {{convert|1.2|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} above ground with the engine below. The Scandinavian countries are less densely populated than the other EU countries; and distances, especially in Finland and Sweden, are long. Until the late 1960s, vehicle length was unlimited, giving rise to long vehicles to handle goods cost effectively. As traffic increased, lengths became more of a concern and they were limited, albeit at a more generous level than in the rest of Europe. In the [[United Kingdom]] in 2009, a two-year desk study of [[Longer Heavier Vehicle]]s (LHVs) including options up to 11-axle, {{convert|34|m|ft|1|adj=on}} long, {{convert|82|t|LT ST|adj=on|lk=on}} combinations, ruled out all road train type vehicles for the foreseeable future.

In 2010, Sweden was performing tests on log hauling trucks, weighing up to {{convert|90|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} and measuring {{convert|30|m|ft|1}} and haulers for two 40&amp;nbsp;ft containers, measuring {{convert|32|m|ft|0}} in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.volvotrucks.com/global/Articles/International/2008/10/The-next-environmental-improvement--long-truck-rigs/The-next-environmental-improvement--long-truck-rigs/ The next environmental improvement - Long truck rigs] ''Volvo Trucks Magazine'' 2008-10-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vk.se/Article.jsp?article=384045|title=Miljövänlig jättebil med timmer|date=8 October 2010|work=Västerbottens-Kuriren|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724014202/http://www.vk.se/Article.jsp?article=384045|archive-date=24 July 2011|url-status=dead|agency=TT|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 started a pilot in Finland to test 104 tonne timber lorry which length is {{convert|33|m|ft}} and has 13 axles.

Since 2015 [[Spain]] has permitted B-doubles with a length of up to {{convert|25.25|m|ft}} and weighing up to 60 tonnes to travel on certain routes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cadenadesuministro.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Modificacion-del-Anexo-IX-del-Reglamento-General-de-Vehi%CC%81culos-copia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
For Mexico the road trains exist in a very small form due the highway sizes and streets in the principal cities, and there are only permitted 2 trailers joined with a pup or dolly created for this purpose, recently{{When|date=May 2019}} the regulations tend to be more severe and strict to avoid overloading and frequent accident chance, to adhere to the federal rules of transportation. Truck drivers must obtain a certificate to certify that the driver is capable to manipulate and drive that type of vehicle.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

All the tractor vehicles that make road train type transport in the country (along with the normal security requirements) need to have visual warnings like...{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

* "Precaucion Doble Semirremolque" alert (Warning Double Semi-Trailer) located in the frontal fenders of the tractor and in the rear part of each trailer.
* Some yellow turning lights of warning to be more visible to another drivers on the road
* a Seal for the entire vehicle approving the use as Double Semi Trailer.
* Federal License plates in every trailer, dolly, and Tractor unit

Some major cargo enterprises in the country use this form to cut costs of carrying all type of goods in some regions where another form of transportation are so expensive to improve it due the difficult geography of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Notice of regulation https://www.elmananerodiario.com/los-doble-remolque-no-se-prohiben-tendran-regulacion-mas-estricta/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican road train equivalent form in Australian Standard is the A-Double form, the difference is that the Mexican road trains can be hauled with a long distance tractor truck.

==Trailer arrangements==
===A-double===
[[File:Bulktrans A-double coal tipper set.jpg|thumb|A-double set with both tipping trailers elevated]]

An A-double consists of a prime mover towing a normal lead trailer with a ball hitch (or some other type of coupling) affixed to it at the rear. A fifth wheel dolly is then affixed to the hitch allowing another standard trailer to be attached. Eleven-axle coal tipping sets carrying to [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]], [[Australia]] are described as A-doubles. The set depicted has a tare weight of 35.5 tonne and is capable of carrying 50 tonne of coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muscattrailers.com.au/trailer/a-double-87-5t/ Muscat Trailer website]&lt;/ref&gt; Note the shield at the front of the second trailer to direct tipped coal from the first trailer downwards.

Pros include the ability to use standard semi-trailers and the potential for very large loads. Cons mainly include very tricky reversing due to the multiple articulation points across two different types of coupling.

===B-double===
[[File:Lindsay Transport B-Double.jpg|thumb|A B-double at a truck stop]]
{{main|B-double}}
{{merge from|B-train|date=December 2019 }}
A B-double ([[B-train]]) consists of a prime mover towing a specialised lead trailer that has a [[fifth wheel coupling|fifth-wheel]] mounted on the rear towing another semi-trailer, resulting in two [[articulated vehicle|articulation points]]. Around container ports in Australia there may also have what is known as a super B-double, i.e. a B-double with a quad axle{{Clarify|date=December 2019}} lead trailer capable of holding one 40-foot shipping container or two 20-foot shipping containers, and the rear trailer being capable of the same with either a tri or quad rear axle set. However, because of their length and low accessibility into narrow streets, these vehicles are restricted in where they can go and are generally used for terminal-to-terminal work, i.e. wharf to container holding park or wharf-to-wharf. The rear axle on each trailer can also pivot slightly while turning to prevent scrubbing out the edges of the tyres due to the heavy loads placed on them.

Pros include fairly straightforward reversing since all articulation points are on fifth wheel couplings, and that the load is spread quite well due to the large number of axles. Cons mainly include the need for specialized trailers and the limited size of said trailers.

===B-triple===
Same as a B-double but with an additional lead trailer behind the prime mover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntc.gov.au/filemedia/bulletins/btriples.pdf COAG backs B-triple network] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729001850/http://www.ntc.gov.au/filemedia/bulletins/btriples.pdf |date=2008-07-29 }}, ntc.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; These are run in most states of Australia where double road trains are allowed. Australia's [[National Transport Commission]] proposed a national framework for B-triple operations that includes basic vehicle specifications and operating conditions that the commission anticipates will replace the current state-by-state approach, which largely discourages the use of B-triples for interstate operation.&lt;ref name=trr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bereni|first=Matthieu|author2=Rob Di Cristoforo|title=Connecting Australia with Modular B-Triples|journal=Transportation Research Record|volume=2288|year=2012|issue=2288|pages=57–65|doi=10.3141/2288-07|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AB triple===
An AB triple consists of a standard trailer with a B-Double behind it using a converter dolly, with a trailer order of Standard, Dolly, B-Train, Standard. The final trailer may be either a B-Train with no trailer attached to it or a standard trailer.

===BAB quad===
A BAB quad consists of two B-double units linked with a converter dolly, with trailer order of Prime Mover, B-Train, Dolly, B-Train.

===C-train===
A C-train is a semi-trailer attached to a [[fifth wheel coupling|fifth-wheel]] on a C-dolly. Unlike in an A-Train, the C-dolly is connected to the tractor or another trailer in front of it with two [[drawbar (haulage)|drawbars]], thus eliminating the drawbar connection as an articulation point. One of the [[axle]]s on a C-dolly is self-steerable to prevent tire scrubbing. C-dollies are not permitted in Australia, due to the lack of articulation.

===Dog-trailer (dog trailer)===

A dog-trailer (also called a pup) is any trailer that is hooked to a converter dolly, with a single A-frame drawbar that fits into the [[Ringfeder]] or [[pintle]] hook on the rear of the trailer in front, giving the whole unit three to five articulation points and very little roll stiffness.

===Interstate road transport registration in Australia===
In 1991, at a special [[Council of Australian Governments|Premiers' Conference]], Australian heads of government signed an inter-governmental agreement to establish a national heavy vehicle registration, regulation and charging scheme, otherwise known as FIRS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/1997-98/98bd192.htm Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1998 (Bills Digest 192 1997-98)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This registration scheme is known as the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme. The requirements of the scheme were as follows:

If the vehicle was purchased to be used for interstate trade, no stamp duty was payable on the purchase price of the vehicle.

The vehicle had to be subjected to an annual inspection for roadworthy standards, which had to be passed before registration could be renewed.

With the registration identification; the first letter of the 6 digit identified the home state: W, Western Australia; S, South Australia; V, Victoria; N, New South Wales; Q, Queensland; T, Tasmania; A, Australian Capital Territory and C, Northern Territory.

Due to the 'eastern' and 'western' mass limits in Australia, two different categories of registration were enacted. The second digit of the registration plate showed what mass limit was allowed for that vehicle. If a vehicle had a 'V' as the second letter, its mass limits were in line with the eastern states mass limits, which were:

* Steer axle, 1 axle, 2 tyres: {{convert|5.40|t|LT ST|abbr=on|lk=on}}
* Steer axle, 2 axles, 2 tyres per axle: Non load sharing suspension {{convert|9.00|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
** Load sharing suspension {{convert|10.00|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
* Single axle, dual tyres: {{convert|8.50|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
* Tandem axle, dual tyres: {{convert|15.00|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
* Tri-axle, dual tyres or 'super single' tyres: {{convert|18.00|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
* Gross combination mass on a 6-axle vehicle not to exceed {{convert|38|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}

If a vehicle had an ''X'' as the second letter, its mass limits were in line with the western states mass limits, which were:
* Steer axle, 1 axle, 2 tyres: {{convert|6.00|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
* Steer axle, 2 axles, 2 tyres per axle
** Non load sharing suspension {{convert|10.00|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}: Load sharing suspension {{convert|11.00|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
* Single axle, dual tyres: {{convert|9.00|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
* Tandem axle, dual tyres: {{convert|16.50|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
* Tri-axle, dual tyres or "super single" tyres: {{convert|20.00|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
* Gross combination mass on a 6-axle vehicle not to exceed {{convert|42.50|t|LT ST|abbr=on|lk=on}}

The second digit of the registration being a ''T'' designates a trailer.

One of the main criteria of the registration was that intrastate operation was not permitted. The load had to come from one state and be delivered to another state or territory. Many grain carriers were reported and prosecuted for cartage from the paddock to the silos. If, though, they went to a port silo, they were given the benefit of the doubt, as that grain was more than likely going overseas.

===Signage===
{{multiple image
| align =
|direction = vertical
|width = 220
|footer = Long Vehicle sign located on the rear bumper
|image1 = B double yass truck stop.JPG
|caption1 = [[B-Train|B double]]
|image2 = Long vehicle warning sign on b double.JPG
| caption2 =
}}
Australian road trains have horizontal signs front and back with {{convert|180|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} high black uppercase letters on a reflective yellow background reading "ROAD TRAIN". The sign(s) must have a black border and be at least {{convert|1.02|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|220|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} high and be placed between {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1.8|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} above the ground on the fore or rearmost surface of the unit.

In the case of B-triples in Western Australia, they are signed front and rear with "ROAD TRAIN" until they cross the WA/SA border where they are then signed with "LONG VEHICLE" in the front and rear.

Converter dollies must have a sign affixed horizontally to the rearmost point, complying to the same conditions, reading "LONG VEHICLE". This is required for when a dolly is towed behind a trailer.

===Combination lengths===
;B-double: {{convert|26|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} max. Western Australia, {{convert|27.5|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} max.
;B-triple: up to {{convert|36.5|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} max.
;NTC modular B-triple: {{convert|35.0|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} max. (uses 2× conventional B-double lead trailers)
;Pocket road train: {{convert|27.5|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} max. (Western Australia only) This configuration is classed as a "Long Vehicle".
;Double road train or AB road train: {{convert|36.5|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} max.
;Triple and ABB or BAB-quad road trains: {{convert|53.5|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} max.

===Operating weights===
Operational weights are based on axle group masses, as follows:
;Single axle (steer tyre): {{convert|6.0|t|LT ST|abbr=on|lk=on}}
;Single axle (steer axle with 'super single' tyres): {{convert|6.7|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
;Single axle (dual tyres): {{convert|9.0|t|LT ST|abbr=on|lk=on}}
;Tandem axle grouping: {{convert|16.5|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}
;Tri-axle grouping: {{convert|20.0|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}

Therefore, 
*A B-double (single axle steering, tandem drive, and two tri-axle groups) would have an operational weight of {{convert|62.5|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}. 

*A double road train (single axle steering, tandem drive, tri-axle, tandem, tri-axle) would have an operational weight of {{convert|79|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}. 

*A triple is {{convert|115.5|t|LT ST|2|abbr=on}}. 

*Quads weigh in at {{convert|135.5|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}. 

*Concessional weight limits, which increase allowable weight to accredited operators&lt;ref name="concession"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.nhvr.gov.au/road-access/mass-dimension-and-loading/concessional-mass-limits
|title=Concessional Mass Limits
|website=National Heavy Vehicle Regulator (nhvr.gov.au)
|accessdate=1 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; can see (for example) a quad weighing up to {{convert|149|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}.

*If a tri-drive prime mover is utilised, along with tri-axle dollies, weights can reach nearly {{convert|170|t|LT ST|0|abbr=on}}.

===Speed limits===
The Australian national heavy vehicle speed limit is {{convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, excepting:

* NSW &amp; Queensland where the speed limit for any road train is {{convert|90|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}

In western Canada, LCVs are restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, or the posted speed limit. Trucks of legal length ({{convert|25|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) may travel at {{convert|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, or the posted speed limit.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}

==World's longest road trains==
[[File:Road Train Australia.jpg|thumb|[[Shell Australia]] 2AB-quad tanker road train in the [[Northern Territory]]. Trailer arrangement is B-double towing two tri-axle trailers.]]
Below is a list of longest road trains driven in the world. Most of these had no practical use, as they were put together and driven across relatively short distances for the express purpose of record-breaking.

*In 1989, a trucker named "Buddo" tugged 12 trailers down the main street of [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]].&lt;ref name=ps13&gt;[http://www.mininghall.com/downloads/mhof_update_december00.pdf Doug's Tug] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930175900/http://www.mininghall.com/downloads/mhof_update_december00.pdf |date=2009-09-30 }}, the pick &amp; shovel (13), December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1993, "Plugger" Bowden took the record with a {{convert|525|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} Mack CLR pulling 16 trailers.
*A few months later this effort was surpassed by [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] driver Malcolm Chisholm with a {{convert|290|t|LT ST|0|adj=on|lk=on}}, 21 trailer rig extending {{convert|315|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name=ps13 /&gt;
*In April 1994 Bob Hayward and Andrew Aichison organised another attempt using a 1988 [[Mack Super-Liner]] 500hp V8 belonging to Plugger Bowden who drove 29 stock trailers measuring 439.169 metres a distance of 4.5km into [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]].&lt;ref&gt;The world's longest roadtrain ''[[Truck &amp; Bus Transportation]]'' June 1994 page 6&lt;/ref&gt; The record was published in the next [[Guinness Book of Records]]. 
*Then the record went back to Winton with 34 trailers.&lt;ref name=ps13 /&gt;
*In 1999, the town of [[Merredin]], officially made it into the Guinness Book of Records, when Marleys Transport made a successful attempt on the record for the world's longest road train. The record was created when 45 trailers, driven by Greg Marley, weighing {{convert|603|t|LT ST|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} and measuring {{convert|610|m|ft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}} were pulled by a [[Kenworth]] 10×6 K100G for {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ps13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marleystransport.com.au/?p=truck The Truck Pull : The World's Longest Road Train], marleystransport.com&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 19 October 2000, Doug Gould set the first of his records in [[Kalgoorlie]], when a roadtrain made up of 79 trailers, measuring {{convert|1018.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} and weighing {{convert|1072.3|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}, was pulled by a [[Kenworth]] C501T driven by Steven Matthews a distance of {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ps13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gouldtransport.com.au/world_records.html World records : Preparations for the Big Attempt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412115149/http://www.gouldtransport.com.au/world_records.html |date=2009-04-12 }}, gouldtransport.com.au, quoted from [[Kalgoorlie Miner]], Friday 10 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 29 March 2003, the record was surpassed near [[Mungindi]], by a road train consisting of 87 trailers and a single prime mover (measuring {{convert|1235.3|m|ft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}} in length).&lt;ref&gt;[http://macktrucks.com.au/index.cfm?NewsID=152&amp;ContentTypeIDList=7&amp;MenuID=98 TALKIN' TITAN TOUGH], 21 November 2005, macktrucks.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;
*The record returned to Kalgoorlie, on 17 October 2004, when Doug Gould assembled 117 trailers for a total length of {{convert|1445|m|ft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}. The record nearly didn't fall, as the first prime mover's main driveshaft broke when taking off. A second truck was quickly made available, and pulled the train a distance of {{convert|1500|m|ft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fleetwatch.co.za/magazines/feb2005/78-ww-feb05.htm Monster Update : ROAD TRAIN RECORD] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826223343/http://www.fleetwatch.co.za/magazines/Feb2005/78-WW-Feb05.htm |date=2009-08-26 }} Fleet Watch,&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2004, the record was again broken by a group from [[Clifton, Queensland]] which used a standard Mack truck to pull 120 trailers a distance of about {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/australia/wa/kalgoor/200602/s1575726.htm Former road train record holder may take on new challenge], 22 February 2006, ABC News online,&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 18 February 2006, an Australian built Mack truck with 113&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-road-train |website=Guinness World Records |accessdate=5 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; semi-trailers, {{convert|1300|t|LT ST|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1474.3|m|ftin}} long, pulled the load {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to recapture the record for the longest road train (multiple loaded trailers) ever pulled with a single prime mover. It was on the main road of [[Clifton, Queensland]], that 70-year-old John Atkinson claimed a new record, pulled by a tri-drive [[Mack Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedieselgypsy.com/Roadtrain_Record-2006.htm Australia's New World Record Road Train Pull], thedieselgypsy.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/02/19/1573349.htm Qld truck driver sets world's longest road train record], 19 February 2006, ABC News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macktrucks.com/default.aspx?pageid=1439 Bulldog Reclaims Record Down Under], macktrucks.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''track renewal train''' (also known as '''track renewal system or new track construction machine''') is a [[work train]] that consists of many units of machinery and materials required for [[Track (rail transport)|track renewal]] (rail and [[Railroad tie|sleeper]] replacement) projects.

==Rail preparation==
To minimize the time of track during a track renewal project, a track renewal train is used to automate most of the required process. Prior to the arrival of the track renewal train, preparation tasks must be completed. In some cases, the old rail needs to be cut into smaller segments and joined with [[fishplate]]s. The rail fastening system may need to be released prior to its arrival.&lt;ref name="plasser"&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewal/Laying RU 800 S|url=http://www.plasseramerican.com/en/p_renewal/ru800s.htm|publisher=Plasser American|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new rails usually need to be prepared prior to the arrival of track renewal train. Rails are delivered to the center of the track. Those rail pieces are welded by track workers to form [[Track (rail transport)#Continuous welded rail|continuous welded rail]] (CWR) and left at the center of the track at the exact position required by the track renewal train to pick up at its arrival.&lt;ref name="uprr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) Track Renewal Train (TRT) Process Video|url=http://www.idothsr.org/media_center/|publisher=Union Pacific Railroad|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Track renewal process==
A track renewal train has a series of machinery units that are combined together into one train. As the track renewal train moves forward, the track renewal process will be done stage by stage to the completion of track renewal as it leaves the area.

===Old sleeper removal===
The first stage of track renewal is the removal of old sleepers. The releasing rail fastening system from the sleepers may be part of this process. Some machines integrate the semi-automatic clip-releasing devices by hoisting such devices as part of the track renewal train to allow operators to manually position the device to each clip and trigger it to automatically release the clip.&lt;ref name=p95uk&gt;{{cite web|title=Track Laying and Renewal Trains P 95|url=http://www.matisa.ch/matisa_ang/matisa_p95_video_uk.html|publisher=Matisa|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some units have a machine to automatically remove spikes in the older type of wooden sleepers.&lt;ref name="uprr"/&gt;

After rails are untied from the sleepers, those old rails will be lifted up and pushed toward the sides of the train. The new rails are also fed in near the sides of the train in preparation to be inserted.

The track renewal train has a machine that pulls the old sleepers out from the [[Track ballast|ballast]]. These old sleepers are delivered into the conveyors to move them out for storage at the rear of the train.

The ballast bed is then cleared in preparation of laying new concrete sleepers. In case there is a need to lower the ballast bed, the ballast excavating process will be done. This process is integrated into the track renewal train in some models. Excess ballast in that case will be moved out through the conveyor belt to the ballast storage area. Those old ballast materials will be screened and cleaned to be reused. The unusable ballast will kept in a separate storage to be discarded.&lt;ref name="plasser"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MATISA’s new Track Renewal Train P95 in the UK|url=http://www.railwaystrategies.co.uk/article-page.php?contentid=12369&amp;issueid=374|accessdate=23 November 2012|newspaper=Railway Strategy|date=February–March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some machines have an automatic track copying by recording the [[track geometry]] of the old rails prior to the removal, then the machine will calculate the exact amount to clear the ballast bed to prepare for laying new sleepers and rails to match to the original geometry of the old ones in term of cant, leveling and positioning.&lt;ref name="p95"&gt;{{cite web|title=Track Renewal Train P95|url=http://www.matisa.ch/prospectus/ang/p95_ang.pdf|publisher=Matisa|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New sleeper laying===
There are [[gantry crane]]s attached to the top of the track renewal train. These cranes run along the special side rails of the train. These special rails also connect between cars allowing operators to travel along the entire length of the train. The cranes are used to transport old sleepers into the storage area and bring the new sleepers into the working area.

The new sleepers are delivered by the cranes to feed into the machine. The machine puts sleepers onto the ballast bed and spaces them to the exact position required by specification.&lt;ref name="uprr"/&gt;

===New rail insertion===
After the new sleepers are laid, the new rails will be pushed from the side of the train into position on the sleepers. To prevent [[rail stressing]] due to temperature fluctuations during normal operation, the rail will need to be laid at a precise temperature, based on anticipated operating temperatures. This is done by heater units of the track renewal train that warm the rails to the specification before laying on the sleepers. Another unit has an automated process to clip the rails onto the sleepers.

Depending on the models of the track renewal train, the old rail will be laid either inside at the center of track&lt;ref name="p95"/&gt; or outside the new track at the shoulder&lt;ref name="uprr"/&gt; waiting to be picked up by another work train.

At the end, a large crane or conveyor belt with a magnet will be used to take all loose parts that have been left on the tracks to storage for reuse or recycling. The new track will be inspected prior to the ballast handling.

===Ballast handling===
After the track renewal train completes the tasks, the ballast will be put back on the track. For track renewal trains that do not have ballast excavating machines included, workers will use a shoulder ballast cutter machine that takes excess ballast that has been pushed out during the track renewal process, into a screening and cleaning machine. The reusable ballast will be put back to the new track together with the new ballast materials. For track renewal trains that do not include track copying or leveling, a [[ballast tamper]] will be used to make final adjustments to the track to the correct specification. A [[ballast regulator]] will then be used to make the final shape of the ballast.

Some track renewal train units have the ballast handling included such that the entire process of shoulder cutting, cleaning and placing of ballast is fully integrated.&lt;ref name="plasser"/&gt;

* {{flagicon|Austria}} RU 800 S by [[Plasser &amp; Theurer]], Austria&lt;ref name="plasser"/&gt;

==Alternative methods==
There was also another method of track renewal for double track area. Jarvis Rail invented a special type of machine called ''Slinger'' to run on the parallel track and deliver the pre-assembled track panels of up to 270 meters into the track to be renewed. This process was used in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slinger speeds relaying on double track|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/slinger-speeds-relaying-on-double-track.html|accessdate=23 November 2012|newspaper=Railway Gazette|date=1 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Here are some notable track renewal projects that use the track renewal trains:
* [[Union Pacific Railroad]] track renewal to include [[higher speed rail]] services in [[Chicago]] area using TRT-909&lt;ref name="uprr"/&gt;
* Track renewal between [[Fleury-les-Aubrais|Les Aubrais]] and [[Vierzon]] in France using Matisa's track renewal train&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France's biggest renewals project|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/frances-biggest-renewals-project.html|accessdate=23 November 2012|newspaper=Railway Gazette|date=1 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shuttle train''' is a [[train]] that runs back and forth between two points, especially if it offers a frequent service over a short route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shuttle|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/shuttle?showCookiePolicy=true| work=Collins English Dictionary|publisher=Collins|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=shuttle train|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shuttle%20train| work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary| publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shuttle trains are used in various ways, in various parts of the world.  They commonly operate as a fixed consist, and run non-stop between their termini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossar Öffentlicher Verkehr|url=http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/oev/glossar/#S| work=Institute for Transport Planning and Systems|publisher=[[ETH Zurich]]|accessdate=6 February 2013|language=de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223092758/http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/oev/glossar/#S|archivedate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They can be used to carry [[passenger train|passengers]], [[freight train|freight]], or both.

==Examples==

===Airport shuttle trains===
An airport shuttle train  may run between an [[airport]] and some other location, or connect two or more terminals. The second is usually in the form of a driverless [[people mover]].

====Italy====
A shuttle train connects [[Pisa Aeroporto railway station|Galileo Galilei Airport]] in [[Pisa]] with [[Pisa Centrale railway station]]. It operates daily and takes five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connections between Pisa Centrale and Galileo Galilei airport|url=http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=d696652188ea7210VgnVCM1000004016f90aRCRD| work=Trenitalia|publisher=[[Trenitalia]]|accessdate=7 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403073320/http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=d696652188ea7210VgnVCM1000004016f90aRCRD|archivedate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=September 2014}}

====United Kingdom====
The [[Gatwick Airport Shuttle Transit]] is a people mover used to transfer passengers between the North and South Terminals at [[London Gatwick Airport]]. It runs every few minutes 24 hours a day, and the journey takes two minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terminal shuttle|url=http://www.gatwickairport.com/at-the-airport/shuttle-update/| work=Gatwick Airport|publisher=Gatwick Airport Limited|accessdate=6 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503154836/http://www.gatwickairport.com/at-the-airport/shuttle-update/|archivedate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Car shuttle trains===
{{main|Car shuttle train}}
A car shuttle train is used to transport accompanied [[automobile]]s, and usually also other types of road vehicles, for a relatively short distance.  Car shuttle trains usually operate on lines passing through a [[rail tunnel]] and connecting two places not easily accessible to each other by road.  On car shuttle train services, the occupants of the road vehicles being carried on the train usually stay with their vehicle throughout the rail journey.

===Commuter shuttle trains===
A shuttle train may be used to carry [[commuter rail|commuters]], especially if at least one of the shuttle train's termini is an [[interchange station]].

====Japan====
During the morning [[rush hour]], the Aichi Loop Line shuttle train runs over the [[Aichi Loop Line]] between [[Mikawa-Toyota Station]] and [[Shin-Toyota Station]] in [[Toyota, Aichi|Toyota]], [[Aichi Prefecture]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction of urban railways: Aichi Loop Line|url=http://www.jrtt.go.jp/11English/pdf/p_rw_005.pdf| work=JRTT|publisher=Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency|accessdate=6 February 2013|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The northeastern end of the [[Tokyo Metro]] [[Chiyoda Line]] is single-tracked although the depot line runs in parallel. Trains serving the terminus are shuttles to the penultimate stop, [[Ayase Station|Ayase]].

The first section of the [[Fukutoshin Line]] of the Tokyo Metro was named the 'New Line', with shuttle trains running express in parallel with the [[Yurakucho Line]], between the [[Ikebukuro Station|Ikebukuro]] and [[Kotake-mukaihara Station|Kotake-mukaihara]] stations.

====New Zealand====
A diesel shuttle train runs between [[Papakura]] and [[Pukekohe]] on the [[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] as this section of the line has not yet been electrified. [[Battery electric multiple unit|Battery powered EMUs]] have been ordered and will replace the [[ADL/ADC class diesel multiple unit| ADL/ADC class]] [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] shuttle in 2019.

====United States====
There are three [[S (New York City Subway service)|shuttle services]] in the [[New York City Subway]], as well as several other non-shuttle services with shuttle portions.  However, of these services, only the [[42nd Street Shuttle]] is a true shuttle that stops only at two locations.  Four shuttle services were formerly run in the subway.

[[NJ Transit Rail Operations|NJ Transit]]'s [[Princeton Branch]], or "dinky", is a shuttle line.  

Despite the name, the [[New Haven–Springfield Shuttle|New Haven–Springfield ''Shuttle'']] is closer to [[commuter rail]] than a true shuttle.

===Others===

====Austria====
The National Intermodal Network Austria, operated by [[Rail Cargo Austria]], uses a hub-and-spoke system of shuttle trains to provide overnight links between the highest volume [[intermodal freight]] terminals in Austria.  The hub of the network is located at [[Wels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NINA - National Intermodal Network Austria|url=http://www.railcargo.at/en/Logistics_services/Intermodal/NINA/index.jsp| work=Rail Cargo Austria|publisher=[[Austrian Federal Railways]]|accessdate=6 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821062535/http://www.railcargo.at/en/Logistics_services/Intermodal/NINA/index.jsp|archivedate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hong Kong====
The [[MTR]] [[Disneyland Resort Line]] is a themed shuttle line linking the [[Hong Kong Disneyland Resort]] with the rest of the network. Another shuttle train runs between the [[Tseung Kwan O Station|Tseung Kwan O]] and [[LOHAS Park Station|LOHAS Park]] stations, on a spur serving a new residential development.

====Spain====
The [[Ramal (Madrid Metro)|R]] line, part of the [[Madrid Metro|Madrid subway]], is a shuttle line connecting Ópera station (lines 2 and 5) with Príncipe Pío station (lines 6 and 10).

====Switzerland====
The Zermatt shuttle connects the [[Auto-free zone|car-free]] [[mountaineering]] and [[ski resort]] of [[Zermatt railway station|Zermatt]] with nearby [[Täsch]], where people travelling to and from Zermatt by combustion-engined vehicles are required to park their machines.  For the better part of most days, the service operates every 20 min and takes 12 min.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zermatt Shuttle|url=http://www.matterhorngotthardbahn.ch/en/spezial_offers/zermatt_shuttle/Pages/default.aspx| work=Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn| publisher=Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Täsch|url=http://www.zermatt.ch/en/page.cfm/zermatt_matterhorn/destination/taesch|work=Zermatt Matterhorn| publisher=Zermatt Tourismus|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
The [[Waterloo and City Line]] on the [[London Underground]] runs between [[Waterloo tube station|Waterloo]] and [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] in the City.

The [[Slough to Windsor &amp; Eton Line]] runs between {{stnlnk|Slough}} and {{stnlnk|Windsor &amp; Eton Central}}.

The [[Butetown Branch Line]] runs between [[Cardiff Queen Street]] and [[Cardiff Bay railway station|Cardiff Bay]].

'''Express trains''' make a small number of stops, usually major destinations, allowing faster service than [[Local train|local trains]] that stop at most or all of the stations along their route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/express%20train| title=express train| website=Merriam-Webster| accessdate=May 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/express-train| title=Definition of 'express train'| website=Collins English Dictionary| accessdate=May 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDIrAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA791&amp;dq=express+train+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxwL7goYniAhUHna0KHcWbDy0Q6AEIXTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=express%20train%20definition&amp;f=false| via=Google Books| page=791| title=Judicial and Statutory Definitions of Words and Phrases - Second Series| editor=the editorial staff of the National Reporter System| location=St. Paul, MN| publisher=West Publishing Co.| year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/subway/howto_sub.htm| title=How to Ride the Subway| website=MTA.info| accessdate=May 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes referred to as "fast trains" (or an equivalent term, such as the German ''[[Schnellzug]]''), meaning that they are faster than other trains on the same route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zU1NAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA767&amp;dq=express+train+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkoLLBponiAhUFTKwKHZBmApo4ChDoAQgxMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=express%20train%20definition&amp;f=false| via=Google Books| pages=767-768| title=Cases Decided in the Court of Session, Court of Justiciary, and House of Lords, From August 3, 1893, to August 25, 1894| volume=Fourth Series, Volume XXI| location=Edinburgh| publisher=T&amp;T Clark, Law Booksellers| year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many [[high-speed rail]] services are express, not all express trains are "fast" relative to other services; early trains in the 19th-century United Kingdom were limited to {{convert|40|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/englishexpresst00foxwgoog| quote=express train definition.| page=[https://archive.org/details/englishexpresst00foxwgoog/page/n69 60]| via=Internet Archive| title=English Express Trains| first=E.| last=Foxwell| location=London| publisher=Edward Stanford| year=1884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/expresstrainsen00foxwgoog| quote=express train definition.| via=Internet Archive| page=[https://archive.org/details/expresstrainsen00foxwgoog/page/n103 93]| title=Express Trains, English and Foreign| first1=E.| last1=Foxwell| first2=T.C.| last2=Farrer| location=London| publisher=Smith, Elder &amp; Co.| year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Express trains sometimes have higher fares than other routes, and bearers of a [[rail pass]] may be required to pay an extra fee.

Some express train routes that overlap with local train service may stop at stations near the tail ends of the line. This can be done, for example, where there is no supplemental local service to those stations. Express train routes may also become local when it is most practical to do so, such as during the night.

In [[Glossary of rail transport terms|rail terminology]], '''portion working''' refers to the operational practice of coupling two or more [[passenger train]]s together over common sections of their respective routes, but otherwise operating the trains separately.&lt;ref name="rentrains"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Potential for Increased On-Rail Competition|url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/pr13/PDF/on-rail_competition_renaissance_trains.pdf|publisher=Renaissance Trains/Office of Rail Regulation UK|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PTN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Further written evidence from Jonathan Tyler, Passenger Transport Networks (HSR 138A)|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmtran/1185/1185vw124.htm|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows multiple trains to use the same [[train path|path]] over parts of the network where limited capacity is available.

Typically, the common sections will be the busiest parts of the totality of the routes covered by a portion working arrangement.&lt;ref name="PTN"/&gt;

==History==
The practice of portion working has been followed for a long time on the third rail network of lines in the South East of England, and has been more widely practised in continental Europe.&lt;ref name="rentrains"/&gt;

Elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the practice has been less common, because of a general reluctance to design the necessary modern signalling systems, and because of legal constraints on competition between operators.&lt;ref name="rentrains"/&gt;

==Possible combinations==
[[File:Scharfenberg coupler in action ICE Leipzig.webm|thumb|Video: Coupling of two [[ICE T]] portions in [[Leipzig]], 2017]]
A variety of portion working combinations is possible.  For example:
* two trains may each depart from separate termini, be coupled together ''en route'', and arrive at their single destination together;
** or vice versa: a pair of trains may depart together from the same terminus, be separated ''en route'', and then continue to separate destinations;
* two trains may each depart from separate termini, be coupled together, and later separated, ''en route'', and then continue to separate destinations;
* a train may depart from a terminus, be coupled ''en route'' to another train departing from the point where the coupling occurs, and then the two trains will continue together to their single destination, thus providing a longer train for a busier portion of the route (or vice versa).
* a train may depart from a terminus, and divide at a station en route, with both portions then continuing to the same destination, but the first running an [[Express train|express]] stopping pattern, and the second part stopping more frequently. In the reverse of this, the second portion is the faster of the two, catching up the slow train at the point where they join.

==Issues==
For portion working to be successful, the operator may need to address many issues.  For example:

* locations for (un)coupling must be identified and designed;
* the best combinations of services must be carefully considered;
* even with optimal operational arrangements (un)coupling takes time;
* portion working can transfer disruption from one section to the wider network.&lt;ref name="PTN"/&gt;

'''Interexpress''' (abbreviated as "''IEx''") is a former international [[train category]].  The word ''Interexpress'' is a short form version of the German language term {{lang|de|Internationaler Express}} (English: ''International Express'') and its foreign language equivalents.

Interexpress services operated between 1986 and 1991 as [[express train]]s between [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]].

== History == 
In the mid 1980s, the State railways of Czechoslovakia ([[Československé státní dráhy]] (ČSD)), the GDR ([[Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR)|Deutsche Reichsbahn]] (DR)), Hungary ([[Magyar Államvasutak]] (MÁV)) and Poland ([[Polskie Koleje Państwowe]] (PKP)) decided to introduce the Interexpress train category for high value passenger train traffic between these four countries.

In 1986, a few ''[[Schnellzug]]''-category trains were converted into IEx trains. This conversion anticipated by one year the equivalent transformation of international express train traffic by the Western European rail operators, which introduced their own new [[EuroCity]] system only in 1987.

Following the political changes in central Europe in 1989/1990, there was no longer any demand for an isolated train service offering for international travellers.  In 1991, the IEx trains were therefore either discontinued, or converted to EuroCity trains or ''Schnellzug'' category services.

== Trains ==
The following trains operated as Interexpresses:
{| class="wikitable" style="clear:both"
|- class="hintergrundfarbe6"
! IEx
! Name
! Route
|-
| IEx 1/2 || ''Silesia'' || Praha hl.n. – Warszawa Wschodnia
|- 
| IEx 9/10 || ''Polonez'' || Moscow (Belorussky station) - Warszawa Zachodnia
|- 
| IEx 36/37 || ''Báthory'' || Budapest – Warszawa
|-
| IEx 72/73 || ''Metropol''&lt;ref&gt;The ''Metropol'' continued to operate as a [[EuroNight]] from [[Budapest Keleti pályaudvar]] to [[Berlin-Wannsee]].&lt;/ref&gt; || Berlin-Lichtenberg – Praha-Holešovice – Budapest
|-
| IEx 74/75 || ''[[Hungaria (train)|Hungaria]]''&lt;ref&gt;The ''Hungaria'' continues to operate as a EuroCity from Budapest-Keleti to [[Hamburg]].&lt;/ref&gt; || Berlin-Lichtenberg – Praha-Holešovice – Budapest
|-
| IEx 76/77 || ''[[Primator (train)|Primator]]'' || Berlin–Lichtenberg – Praha
|-
| IEx 78/79 || ''[[Progress (train)|Progress]]'' || Berlin–Lichtenberg – Praha
|-
| IEx 242/243 || ''[[Berolina (train)|Berolina]]'' || Berlin Hauptbahnhof – Warszawa Wschodnia
|}

The ''Báthory'' and the ''Metropol'' were overnight trains that also included [[sleeping car|sleeping]] and [[couchette car]]s.

Some of the IEx trains included [[through coach]]es at least occasionally; examples were the ''Metropol'' (to Vienna), and the ''[[Berolina (train)|Berolina]]'' (from Paris).  In 1986/87 and 1987/88, the ''[[Hungaria (train)|Hungaria]]'' ran coupled together with the D374/375 ''[[Vindobona (train)|Vindobona]]'' to Vienna, and in summer included through coaches from [[Malmö]] in Sweden.

The ''Progress'' operated as an IEx train only in 1986/87 and 1987/88 and then reverted to its previous classification. Its IEx formation ([[consist]]) included special air-conditioned ''Komfortwagen'' in a red-white livery.

The fares charged for travel in IEx trains were in accordance with the normal ''Schnellzug'' tariffs. Seat reservations were compulsory for all passengers.

A '''circus train''' is a method of conveyance for [[circus]] troupes. One of the larger users of circus trains was the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] (RBBX), a famous American circus formed when the [[Ringling Brothers Circus]] purchased the [[Barnum and Bailey Circus]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trainweb.org/carl/CircusTrains/CircusTrainFacts.htm Train web, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus Train Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polar.sunynassau.edu/~fanellis/circus.html Nassau Community College, PICTURES OF THE RINGLING BROTHERS and BARNUM &amp; BAILEY CIRCUS TRAIN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circustrains.com/ circustrains.com], &lt;/ref&gt;
In 1872 the P.T. Barnum Circus had grown so large that it was decided that they would only play at large venues, and that they would travel by train. P.T. Barnum had two of his  partners, [[William Cameron Coup]] and Dan Costello, come up with a system to load the [[circus wagon]]s on to railroad [[Flatcar|flat cars]]. Using a system of [[inclined plane]]s, called runs, and [[crossover plate]]s between cars, they developed a system of [[rope]]s and [[pulley]]s, along with a [[snubber post]]{{clarify|date=January 2020}}" to get the [[wagon]]s on and off of the flat cars. They used horses to pull the wagons up the run and then would hitch a second team to pull it down the run cars (flats). The off-loading was much the same as loading, but a snubber post was used to help brake the wagons' descent down the run. That system, first used in 1872, was used by the RBBBC until its closing, although through more modern methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title=Great American Circus and Show Trains| publisher=[[Pentrex]]| url=http://www.pentrex.com/circus.html| date=1999| location=Pasadena, California| medium=VHS| access-date=2007-08-22| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929021422/http://www.pentrex.com/circus.html| archive-date=2007-09-29| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2eRjVRLZk Youtube The RBBB Circus Train unloads its cargo and load the animals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinglyheirs.com/NewYorkStateRailroads/circus1.html#.WA1NKMkqhxA kinglyheirs.com, Circus Trains: The Second Greatest Show on Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trains21.org/the-ringling-bros-barnum-bailey-circus-train-exits-northeast-pa/ Train 21,  The Ringling Bros. &amp; Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus Train (Red Show) Exits Northeast Pa., May 3, 2016 ]&lt;/ref&gt;
When the circus switched to travel by train they began by using [[flatcar]]s from the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], which turned out to be hazardous because the Pennsylvania Railroad's cars were in poor shape. In mid-season it was decided that they would buy their own cars, and when the P.T. Barnum Circus left Columbus, Ohio, it traveled on the first circus-owned train. It was made up of 60 cars, including 19-45 flatcars carrying about 100 wagons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trainweb.org/carl/ResidentialCarsInAnaheim/compressed/RinglingBrosTrainCoaches.htm Train Web, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus Train Part II, The Residential Cars.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gregariousrailfan.com/Ringlingbrosmain.html gregariousrailfan.com, The Circus Trains]&lt;/ref&gt;
Circus trains have proven well-suited for the transportation of heavy equipment ([[tent]]s, rolling [[wagon]]s&lt;!-- which wagon does not roll? --&gt;, [[vehicle]]s and [[Machine (mechanical)|machinery]]) and [[animal]]s ([[elephant]]s, [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s and [[horse]]s), despite tragic accidents over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vistadome.com/trains/circus/ vistadome.com, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus cars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scgov.net/History/Pages/CircusinVenice.aspx |title=Sarasota County Historical Commission., Elephants disembarking from Ringling Bros. train |access-date=2016-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024090236/https://www.scgov.net/History/Pages/CircusinVenice.aspx |archive-date=2016-10-24 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circuses separately and together grew to dominate live entertainment through their frequent purchases of many other American circuses. In modern times, they traveled in two circus trains, the blue unit and the red unit, following an alternating two-year schedule to bring a new show to each location once a year. The RBBB circus trains were more than {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} in length, and included living quarters for the performers and animal keepers. There were also special [[stock car (rail)|stock cars]] for the exotic animals and [[flatcar]]s for the transportation of circus wagons, equipment, and even a [[bus]] used for local transportation at performance sites.&lt;ref&gt;  [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/nyregion/11metjournal.html?_r=0 NY Times, For Circus Workers, Home Is Where the Train Is, By ANNE BARNARD, April 10, 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus closed its doors permanently in May 2017, and its train cars were either auctioned off or scrapped not too long after. In early 2018, Kirby Family Farm, located in Florida, purchased some of the cars and planned to turn them into dormitories for kids with [[special needs]].

Another, the last operating carnival train in the United States, is operated in the east by [[Strates Shows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://trainweb.org/carl/CircusTrain2012/ Train Web, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Blue Unit Circus Train]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Penmanshiel Tunnel (coal train on new alignment)..jpg|thumb|250px|right|A merry-go-round train hauled by a [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66]] locomotive]]

A '''merry-go-round train''', often abbreviated to '''MGR''', is a [[Unit train|block train]] of [[Hopper car|hopper wagons]] which both loads and unloads its cargo while moving. In the [[United Kingdom]], they are most commonly [[coal]] trains delivering to [[power stations]]. These trains were introduced in the 1960s, and were one of the few innovations of the [[Beeching axe]], along with investment from the [[CEGB]] (Central Electricity Generating Board) and the NCB ([[National Coal Board]]) into new power stations and loading facilities. 

== History and description ==
[[West Burton Power Station]] was used as a testing ground for the MGR system&lt;ref&gt;Railway Magazine 1965 July, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; but the first power station to receive its coal by MGR was [[Cockenzie Power Station|Cockenzie]] in Scotland in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Railway Magazine 1965 March, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated at the time that the 80 MGR hoppers needed to feed Cockenzie would replace up to 1500 conventional wagons.&lt;ref&gt;Railway Magazine 1965 April, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 1.2&amp;nbsp;GW power station, such as Cockenzie, receives up to 3 million tons of coal a year, whereas a larger 2&amp;nbsp;GW plant, like West Burton, up to 5 million tons per year. By the end of 1966 there were about 900 wagons carrying 53,000&amp;nbsp;tons a week to four power stations.&lt;ref&gt;Modern Railways June 1967 p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Power stations that were built to handle the new MGR traffic were [[Aberthaw Power Station|Aberthaw]], [[Drax power station|Drax]], [[Didcot Power Station|Didcot]], [[Eggborough Power Station|Eggborough]], [[Ferrybridge power stations#Ferrybridge C .281966.E2.80.932016.29|Ferrybridge C]],&lt;ref&gt;Modern Railways October 1966 p. 521&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fiddlers Ferry Power Station|Fiddlers Ferry]] and [[Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station|Ratcliffe]], of which the former and latter pairs are still open for traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Didcot A Power Station switched off after 43 years|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-21881129|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the older power stations were gradually converted to MGR operation.

Merry-go-round operation was also adopted for the [[Immingham Bulk Terminal]] built in the early 1970s to supply [[iron ore]] to the [[Scunthorpe Steelworks]] from the [[Port of Immingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| work = Industrial Britain| title = The Steel Industry in Post War Britain| first= David W.| last = Heal | publisher = David and Charles | isbn = 0 7153 6565 7 | year = 1974| page=175-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The MGR hopper wagons ==
[[File:HAA 354966.jpg|thumb|HAA 354966 at Barrow Hill, with EWS-liveried framework]]
There were 11,162 MGR hoppers built. The numbering ranges were 350000-359571, 365000-366129 and 368000-368459

The two prototype wagons, 350000 and 350001, were built at Darlington works in 1964 and 1965 respectively, following which several large batches were constructed at the nearby Shildon works. With the exceptions of the two prototypes built at Darlington and the 160 wagons built at Ashford, all 10,702 HAA wagons and 460 HDA wagons were built there. Most of the early wagons (up to 355396) were originally lettered with B prefix numbers but these were later removed.

While the majority of the wagons were built as HAAs, the final batch (built in 1982 as 368000-368459) were coded as HDA to indicate their ability to operate at up to 60&amp;nbsp;mph when empty instead of the standard 45&amp;nbsp;mph. This was achieved through modifications to the design of the brakes. Another variation, which did not initially result in a change of TOPS code, was the fitting of top canopies to increase the load volume. Many of the early wagons had these but then lost them and for some years canopied hoppers were only common in Scotland.

When MGR services were first introduced, [[British Rail]] designed an all-new wagon with [[air brake (rail)|air brakes]] and a capacity for 33 tonnes of pulverised coal. The prototype was a 32-ton unit and was built at Darlington and tested in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Railway Magazine 1965 April, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the introduction of [[TOPS]] these wagons were referred to by the telegraphic code name "HOP AB 33", this was an abbreviation of Hopper Air Brake 33 tonne.

With the coming of privatisation to Britain's railways, new wagon types have been introduced by [[DB Cargo UK|EWS]] (HTA), [[GB Railfreight]] (HYA), [[Freightliner Group|Freightliner]] Heavy Haul (HHA and HXA) and Jarvis Fastline (IIA). These new wagons have increased tonnage and air-operated doors that do away with the need for the "Dalek" release mechanism at the power station end of the trip.&lt;ref&gt;Monk-Steel, David (2011) Merry-go-round on the rails. HMRS publishing, Butterley Station, Derbys. 196 pages {{ISBN|978-0-902835-30-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== MGR wagon variants ==
With the introduction of TOPS in 1973 the wagons were given the code "HAA", over the years with modifications to wagons other codes have been allocated including HDA and HMA.

From the early 1990s further TOPS codes were introduced to show detail differences such as canopies and modified brakes. Many HAAs became HFAs, while all of the HDAs became HBAs, this code now being available since all the original HBA hoppers had been rebuilt as HEAs. Later codes used were HCA, HMA and HNA.

== MGR wagon liveries ==
The livery of these wagons was of unpainted metal hoppers and black underframes. The hopper support framework was originally brown, then red with the introduction of the new [[Railfreight]] image in the late 1970s. When Railfreight re-invented itself in 1987, a new livery with yellow framework and a large coal sector logo on the hopper side was introduced. Under EWS the framework is now painted maroon. Merry-go-round hoppers were worked hard however, and the typical livery included a coating of coal dust. Some of the terminals served used stationary shunters to move the wagons forward at low speed. These often featured tyred wheels that gripped the wagon sides, resulting in horizontal streaks on the hopper sides.

== The balloon loop and the Daleks ==
[[File:MGR Dalek.jpg|thumb|An MGR Dalek, in as received condition from Hope Cement Works]]
[[File:Merry go round train detail.jpg|thumb|Merry Go Round at Cottam Power Station, 1970-1995.]]
Associated with merry-go-round trains are the construction of [[balloon loop]]s at the origin and destination so that the train doesn't waste time shunting the engine from one end of the train to the other. However, whilst power stations such as Ratcliffe, West Burton and Cottam had [[balloon loop]]s, few if any colliery/loading points had them and thus true merry-go-round operation never really existed.

"[[Dalek]]" was the nickname given to the automatic door opening/closing equipment located on the approach to and from the bunker in the power station. The nickname was derived from its appearance. Two have been preserved by The National Wagon Preservation Group from Hope Cement Works. They arrived at Barrow Hill on Friday 28 August 2015.

== Locomotive control ==

Locomotives used on the MGR trains needed to be fitted with electronic speed control known as ''Slow Speed Control'', so that the driver could engage the system and the train could proceed at a fixed very slow speed under the loading and unloading facilities. The system was originally fitted to some members of [[British Rail Class 20|Class 20]], [[British Rail Class 26|Class 26]] and [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47]]. Later, some members of [[British Rail Class 37|Class 37]] were also fitted, while the system was fitted to all members of classes [[British Rail Class 56|56]], [[British Rail Class 58|58]], [[British Rail Class 59|59]], [[British Rail Class 60|60]] and [[British Rail Class 66|66]]. Additionally, all [[British Rail Class 50|Class 50]]s were originally fitted, although the system was later removed due to non-use.

The class 47 locomotives were replaced by the class 56s in 1977 with an increase of the number of wagons in a train, in most cases to around 30 to 34. This was followed by the class 58s and the class 60s. Two of the class 60s were named in honour of the men behind the MGR system, 60092 Reginald Munns and 60093 Jack Stirk. A small number of other locomotives were modified for working MGRs. In Scotland the class 26 and some class 20s and in South Wales some class 37s.

In 1985 another change started, Driver Only Operated (DOO), after a short training session on the wagons which basically showed how to isolate a defective brake. MGR trains in the Worksop and Shirebrook areas to West Burton and Cottam started running. These trains initially had a yellow painted tail lamp to identify that the train was DOO. As the system rapidly developed in all areas the use of these yellow tail lamps was discontinued.

== MGR hopper decline and re-use ==
The decline in the UK mining industry from the 1980s onwards made many of these wagons redundant. More of the type were replaced when EWS introduced a new batch of 1144 high-capacity bogie coal hoppers (HTA) from 2001. The last location to have coal delivered by MGR wagons was the Hope Cement Works in August 2010.

Although many HAAs were scrapped as being worn out, over 1000 have donated their underframes to be rebuilt as MHA lowsided box spoil wagons for infrastructure and general use. Conversions have been undertaken since 1997 and the new vehicles have been numbered in the 394001-394999 and 396000-396101 ranges.

A batch of 15 HAAs were rebuilt as china clay hoppers with a canvas roof (CDA), all but one of which were renumbered in the 375124-375137 range, the other being extant 353224 which is [[Merry-go-round train#Extant examples|listed below]].

There were 14 HAAs modified as MSA Scrap Hoppers in 2004 and renumbered in the 397000-397013 range. They proved to be a short-lived idea though as the light alloy bodies took too much damage from rough use and were withdrawn and scrapped after only a few weeks of use.

== Extant examples ==
[[File:351207 Moreton In Marsh.jpg|thumb|351207 extant at Moreton In Marsh Fire Training College]]
There are a total of 7 MGR hoppers still remaining on the network, excluding the examples that were successfully converted into China Clay covered hoppers.

The first MGR to be preserved was the Darlington-built prototype, HAA 350000, in October 1995&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrm.org.uk/OurCollection/LocomotivesAndRollingStock/CollectionItem.aspx?objid=1995-7852&amp;pageNo=17&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://www.nrm.org.uk/ The National Railway Museum]

In 2011, The NRM secured the last-built MGR hopper, HDA 368459 and it was appropriately moved to its Shildon outpost in May of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.railexpress.co.uk/news/final-shildon-built-mgr-hopper-goes-on-display |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924084445/http://www.railexpress.co.uk/news/final-shildon-built-mgr-hopper-goes-on-display |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, in 2014 an appeal was set up called The MGR Appeal to try and preserve another example, this being in the form of HMA 355798. After a successful appeal, it was saved for preservation from DB Schenker. It was formerly stored at their Immingham depot in Lincolnshire. In July 2015, the MGR Appeal was officially formed as [http://www.nwpg.co.uk National Wagon Preservation Group] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwpg.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, [http://www.chasewaterrailway.co.uk/ The Chasewater Railway] secured three MGR hoppers from Mossend Yard (DBS) and moved them to Brownhills West station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chasewaterrailway.co.uk/news/breaking-news-new-special-arrivals/&lt;/ref&gt; In their statement, it was advised that these three MGRs were the "arrival of the first half of our HAA wagon fleet". The other three likely candidates are the three withdrawn in the Newport Docks area. Since then however, No.353934 which was stored off the tracks has been cut up by accident. However the group is still intending to preserve the remaining 2 examples. 

As of 2020 the Chasewater railway has 6 MGR wagons all of which have been returned to running order, most recently HDA No.368103.

There is the potential for Knottingley TMDs No.350002 to join the fleet if the depot is closed in future.

A '''headboard''' is a board hung on the front of a [[locomotive]]. Generally it can depict a [[Lists of named passenger trains|named train]]. Headboards are distinct from [[locomotive nameplate]]s.

In the [[United Kingdom]], headboards were common on the public railway in the age of [[Steam locomotive|steam]] and into the age of [[Diesel locomotive|Diesel]] and [[electric locomotive|electric]] trains, although in modern times, use of headboards on scheduled trains is now defunct, although headboards are often still used on the occasion of a "last train", such as the withdrawal of a particular class of train. On the scheduled network, headboards were used to denote special named trains, such as luxury [[Pullman train (UK)|pullmans]], blue riband [[Inter-city rail|expresses]] or other once a day special services such as [[boat train]]s. Latterly, headboards are still used by [[railtour]] companies, to denote the name of a tour, or more generally the name of the organisation running a tour. Headboards are also frequently used on [[heritage railway]] line services to denote special trains or events. Common practice in the UK is to display the headboard on the front of a locomotive (temporarily attached, to denote the name of the train or other purpose), and to have the nameplate of the locomotive on the side of the locomotive (permanently attached to denote the name of the locomotive). Confusion may have arisen over the example of the "Flying Scotsman"&amp;nbsp;— where [[Flying Scotsman (train)|''The Flying Scotsman'']] is a famous named train service operating since 1862, after which a now famous locomotive, the 1923 built [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|No. 4472 ''Flying Scotsman'']] was named&amp;nbsp;— while the ''Flying Scotsman'' headboard has been worn by many different locomotives over the years, when No. 4472 was running the service for which it was built, this would give rise to No. 4472 displaying the name ''Flying Scotsman'' on both the front and the side of the locomotive.

'''Ground vibration boom''' is a phenomenon of very large increase in [[ground vibrations]] generated by high-speed railway trains travelling at speeds higher than the velocity of [[Rayleigh wave|Rayleigh surface waves]] in the supporting ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ground-vibration-boom.html "Ground vibration boom"], ''Railway Gazette'', 1 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical background ==

[[File:Swedish high-speed train X2000 at Ledsgard.jpg|thumb|Swedish high-speed train X 2000 approaching Ledsgard.]]

This phenomenon, which is similar to a [[sonic boom]] from [[supersonic aircraft]], was theoretically predicted in 1994. Its first experimental observation took place in 1997-1998 on the newly built high-speed railway line in Sweden (from Gothenburg to Malmo) for high-speed trains [[X 2000]]. At some locations along this line characterised by very soft ground (near Ledsgard) the Rayleigh wave velocity was as low as 45&amp;nbsp;m/s, and train speeds of only 165–170&amp;nbsp;km/h were sufficient to observe the effect. In particular, the increase in train speeds from 140 to 180&amp;nbsp;km/h was accompanied by about tenfold increase in generated ground vibration level, which agrees with the theory. It is now understood that, with the increase of operating train speeds, this phenomenon represents a major environmental problem associated with building new high-speed railway lines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmtran/writev/rail/m53.htm "The Application and Effect of the Rayleigh Wave Speed Principle on High Speed Rail travel - Written evidence from David Rayney"], ''UK Parliament Website'', 15 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2012/02/20/derailment-fears-over-high-speed-rail-scheme/ "Derailment fears over high speed rail scheme"], ''Express &amp; Star'', 20 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://stophs2.org/news/11255-archives-rayleigh-waves-hs2/ "From the Archives: Rayleigh Waves and HS2"], ''STOP HS2 Website'', 8 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mitigation measures ==

The most efficient way to mitigate ground vibration boom is to reduce train speeds at locations where Rayleigh wave velocities in the ground are very low.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stophs2.org/news/15268-railing-rayleigh-waves "Railing against Rayleigh Waves"], ''STOP HS2 Website'', 14 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is not desirable, e.g. for economic reasons, some mitigation measures can be applied, such as stiffening of railway embankments or building protective trenches and barriers between railways and residential or industrial buildings. Any mitigation measures would involve the specific ground investigation works along the route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/HS2/hs2-defends-itself-against-derailment-claims "HS2 defends itself against derailment claims"], ''Rail Technology Magazine'', 14 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transcantábrico''' crosses northern Spain, along the [[Bay of Biscay]]. It is the oldest of Spain's tourist trains, managed by the Spanish public company [[FEVE]] since its inauguration in 1983 until 2012, when FEVE disappeared and [[Renfe Operadora]] took over.

== History ==

With the Transcantábrico, FEVE (Narrow Gauge Railways) created the first hotel-train in Spain. The original idea was to create a tourist train, emulating the legendary [[Orient Express]], which would use FEVE's tracks in northern Spain. The special feature of this train is that, unlike other tourist trains, it operates on {{track gauge|1m}} [[track gauge|gauge]] track.

It opened for business on 30 July 1983 with an inaugural trip between [[La Robla]] and [[Cistierna]] in [[León, Spain|Leon]]. Its original composition was three [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman]] lounge cars built in the UK in 1923 (pub, bar and lounge), 4 bunk bed cars, a generator car and a service car for the crew.

{{As of|2015}} there are 2 trains, the Classic and the Luxury,&lt;ref name=RENFE-eltren&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.renfe.com/trenesturisticos/eng/transcantabrico-el-tren.html| title=El Transcantábrico.

== Itinerary ==
For the first years it travelled between Leon and Ferrol (through Bilbao), until the closure of the Leon - Bilbao (Ferrocarril de La Robla) line, when it then travelled between Bilbao and Ferrol. After the reopening of the La Robla line in 2003, it returned to original route. In 2009 new special services were introduced from San Sebastián to Santiago de Compostela and from 2010 services were made regular to/from San Sebastian using this Basque Railway Network from Basauri.

Since 2011 there is also the Transcantábrico Luxury, a new tourist train that runs between San Sebastian and Santiago de Compostela, while the former tourist train was renamed Transcantábrico Classic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.renfe.com/trenesturisticos/transcantabrico.html| title=Transcantábrico| website=RENFE| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909232652/http://www.renfe.com/trenesturisticos/transcantabrico.html| archivedate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining the traditional route between Leon and Ferrol (through Bilbao).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.renfe.com/trenesturisticos/eng/transcantabrico-itinerarios-y-salidas.html| title=Itineraries and Departures| website=RENFE| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922115102/http://www.renfe.com/trenesturisticos/eng/transcantabrico-itinerarios-y-salidas.html| archivedate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2015}} there are 2 routes operating regular services from March until October:

* Luxury: running from [[San Sebastián]] to [[Santiago de Compostela]] and back.
* Classic: running from [[León, Spain|León]] to [[Santiago de Compostela]] through [[Bilbao]] and back.

The trains can also be hired for charter trips, adapted to clients, for groups and companies for incentives, conferences and exhibitions.

== Facilities and services ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Transcantabrico Luxury Suite.jpg|thumb|right|Transcantabrico Luxury Suite]] --&gt;
The current train composition is 4 saloon cars, 7 sleeper cars, a generator wagon and a service car for the crew. The original bunk cabins have been replaced by suites equipped with bedroom and bathroom, a double bed, wardroom, bag storage, desk, safe, adjustable climate control, in-room music, telephone, minibar, and a bathroom with hairdryer and hydromassage shower/steam sauna.

The Luxury train composition is similar except that passenger capacity is halved, with rooms much larger than the Classic, with a living area apart from the bedroom, a two-metre double bed or twin beds, a sofa that converts into a double bed in the living room, flatscreen TV and a computer with free Internet connection.

Its lounges and suites combine early 20th century’s charm with modern comforts such as WiFi and flatscreen TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.renfe.com/trenesturisticos/eng/transcantabrico-el-tren-extendido.html| title=El Transcantábrico.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Panoramic Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|Panoramic Wagon]] --&gt;
The original 1923 Pullman cars are authentic jewels of historical and railway heritage, and are used for serving onboard à la carte breakfasts and meals; the bar car is permanently open; other areas include tea lounges, the panoramic view car or the pub car, where parties, music or live shows are offered every night. All cars are interconnected, so travellers can move freely between them and their accommodation units.

Both in the train's lounges and in the renowned restaurants along the route, the gastronomic offer is handled by famous kitchens and chefs from northern Spain, celebrated for to the quality of its professionals and ingredients.&lt;ref name=gastronomy&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.renfe.com/trenesturisticos/eng/transcantabrico-la-experiencia-gastronomia.html#cajas-centrales| title=Gastronomy| website=RENFE| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922100629/http://www.renfe.com/trenesturisticos/eng/transcantabrico-la-experiencia-gastronomia.html| archivedate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew is headed by an expedition leader and includes a guide, the head waiter, waiters, music entertainer, cleaners, security, train driver, bus driver and rail technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.renfe.com/trenesturisticos/eng/transcantabrico-la-experiencia-tripulacion.html#cajas-centrales| title=The Crew| website=RENFE| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211417/http://www.renfe.com/trenesturisticos/eng/transcantabrico-la-experiencia-tripulacion.html| archivedate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guide accompanies travellers on all visits and restaurants. In addition it offers guests national, international and local press.

The maximum capacity is 54 people on the Classic train and 28 for the Luxury train.

'''Midwest Rail Rangers''' is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose mission is to present on-board educational programs to railroad passengers in the [[Midwestern United States]] regarding such topics as history, ecology, and geology.

Interpretive Guides with Midwest Rail Rangers provide interpretive programs on-board the [[South Shore Line]] between [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[South Bend, Indiana]] two to three weekends per month, year-round. The Midwest Rail Rangers also partner with the [[Wisconsin Great Northern Railroad]] to present history talks aboard their Sky Parlour Car, a former [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] ("Santa Fe") [[Hi-Level]] [[lounge car]] / [[Amtrak]] Pacific Parlour Car. Guides with the organization also present educational programs several times per year on private rail excursions featuring heritage railroad equipment from the 1950s and 1960s, group rail charters on [[Amtrak]] organized by the 20th Century Railroad Club of Chicago, and at various railroad museums and train shows.

The organization is operated out of [[Barron, Wisconsin]], however most guides living in the Chicago or Milwaukee areas.

== History ==
The Midwest Rail Rangers was officially chartered on July 20, 2015, however its origins date back nearly two decades through an organization called Trails &amp; Rails.
[[File:RRJune .jpg|left|thumb|387x387px|A Midwest Rail Ranger volunteer is seen here presenting an interpretive program to passengers aboard a train in Illinois.]]
In 1999, [[Amtrak]] and the [[National Park Service]] established a formal partnership agreement to place park rangers and volunteers on select long-distance passenger trains across the United States to present on-board educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. "[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/amtraktrailsandrails/about.htm Partnering to Connect People with Places]"&lt;/ref&gt; Docents would point out interesting landmarks along the way to passengers, including the history of various towns the train was passing through, ecology, and geology of the landscape. A Chicago-based Trails &amp; Rails program was established in 2000. The [[Illinois and Michigan Canal|Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor]] sponsored a Trails &amp; Rails program on Amtrak's [[Texas Eagle]] between [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis|Saint Louis]], Missouri that ran through 2004. The following year, Trails &amp; Rails decided to move volunteers to the [[Empire Builder]] &lt;ref&gt;PR Newswire, July 12, 2005. "[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amtrak-builds-on-a-good-thing-empire-builder-to-get-fresh-new-look-54552687.html Amtrak Builds on a Good Thing: Empire Builder to Get Fresh New Look]"&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2005 and 2010, volunteers presented programs in the lounge car between [[Chicago Union Station]] and either [[Winona, Minnesota|Winona]], [[Minnesota]] or [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul, Minnesota]]. In September 2010, Trails &amp; Rails management put an end to all Trails &amp; Rails programs out of Chicago due to budget concerns.

In late 2012, the American Passenger Rail Heritage Foundation (APRHF), a 501(c)(3) non-profit rail history organization, approached Amtrak and the National Park Service about establishing a new Trails &amp; Rails program on the [[Southwest Chief]] between Chicago and [[La Plata, Missouri]]. Since there were no National Park Service units along the route at the time, it was agreed that the APRHF would manage the day-to-day operations of the program, with additional oversight provided by Trails &amp; Rails National Coordinator James Miculka, who was based in [[College Station, Texas]]. A group of 30 Chicago-based Trails &amp; Rails volunteers were chosen, and the first program took place on May 18, 2013.  During its two-and-a-half year run, the APRHF-sponsored Trails &amp; Rails program through Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri reached out to over 50,000 Amtrak passengers, with more than 200 programs given.&lt;ref&gt;Miculka, James E., National Park Service Volunteer-in-Parks Report. [http://www.trainweb.org/outsidetherails/FY14stats.xls "FY 14 Trails &amp; Rails Statistics Final]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Bonnie. Mendota Reporter, June 18, 2013, "[http://www.mendotareporter.com/v2_news_articles.php?heading=0&amp;page=72&amp;story_id=7500 Mendota on line for Trails &amp; Rails program on Amtrak] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324023035/http://www.mendotareporter.com/v2_news_articles.php?heading=0&amp;page=72&amp;story_id=7500 |date=2016-03-24 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, Monica. KTVO-TV, July 11, 2013, "[http://ktvo.com/news/local/all-aboard-for-trails-and-rails All aboard for Trails and Rails]"&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, Trails &amp; Rails National Coordinator Jim Miculka informed the APRHF Board of Directors that he wished the end the partnership agreement. The final Trails &amp; Rails program on the Southwest Chief between Chicago and La Plata took place on July 19, 2015.

In the weeks that followed, the APRHF received hundreds of e-mails and phone calls from passengers who wanted the onboard educational programs to continue. As a result, the organization's Board of Directors announced the creation of the APRHF Rail Rangers program. Since Trails &amp; Rails holds an exclusive agreement to provide narration services on Amtrak trains, the APRHF Rail Rangers decided to focus its efforts on providing interpretive programs on private railroad excursions, non-Amtrak public trains, group charters, and at railroad museums. The name Rail Rangers pays homage to the organization's roots with Trails &amp; Rails, as Rail Rangers was slated to be the original name of Trails &amp; Rails before a last-minute change by Amtrak.

In December 2018, it was announced that the Rail Rangers would be splitting off from the APRHF in order to form an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The name was officially changed to the Midwest Rail Rangers &lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions, December 14, 2018 Web Post. "[https://www.wdfi.org/apps/CorpSearch/Details.aspx?entityID=M105060&amp;hash=339252928&amp;searchFunctionID=c671dd7f-039c-4b11-bd5b-2662bb751028&amp;type=Simple&amp;q=MIDWEST+RAIL+RANGERS/ ‘Midwest Rail Rangers’ Certificate of Non-Profit Status]"&lt;/ref&gt; on December 14, 2018. On-board educational programs on both the [[South Shore Line]] and private rail excursions continue to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Exciting News About the Future of Rail Rangers for 2019 and Beyond, December 2018 TrainWeb Post. "[http://www.trainweb.org/outsidetherails/RRsplit2018/]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Rail Programs on the South Shore Line ==
[[File:SouthShoreLine.jpg|left|thumb|320x320px|Rail Rangers on the South Shore Line]]
The main focus of the Midwest Rail Rangers is to provide on-board educational programs on select departures of the [[South Shore Line]] between Chicago's [[Millennium Station]] and [[South Bend Airport station]]. Programs feature live narration in one designated car, free route guide sheets, route guidebooks (for purchase), and a Junior Ranger program for kids and teens aboard. Eastbound programs take place on Train #503, which departs Chicago-Millennium Station at 8:40 am CT and arrives at South Bend Airport Station at 12:10 pm ET. After an hour layover, Guides present a program for westbound passengers on Train #506, which departs South Bend Airport at 1:05 pm ET and arrives into Downtown Chicago at 2:39 pm CT. Upcoming program dates are posted on the non-profit's website dedicated to its South Shore Line programs at [http://www.DunesTrain.com www.DunesTrain.com]. These programs are presented in partnership with the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District.&lt;ref&gt;Trainweb Report, July 5, 2017. "[http://www.trainweb.org/outsidetherails/RRSouthShore2017/]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trains Magazine, July 10, 2017. "[http://cs.trains.com/trn/f/742/p/263956/2978726.aspx]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakeshore Public Radio, July 11, 2017. "[http://lakeshorepublicradio.org/post/rail-rangers-join-south-shore-line-passengers-ride#stream/0]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In partnership with the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District, the Midwest Rail Rangers have also researched, written, and published a 120-page railroad route guidebook for the [[South Shore Line]]. This route guidebook, entitled "Outside the Rails: A Rail Route Guide from Chicago to South Bend Airport" &lt;ref&gt;Outside the Rails Book. "[https://www.amazon.com/Outside-Rails-Route-Chicago-Airport/dp/1365876519]"&lt;/ref&gt; covers the history of the communities along the route of the [[South Shore Line]], including [[Chicago]], [[East Chicago]], [[Hammond, Indiana|Hammond]], [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Portage, Indiana|Portage]], [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]], [[Hudson Lake, Indiana|Hudson Lake]], and [[South Bend]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newcarlislegazette.com/single-post/2018/04/05/RAIL-RANGERS-RETURN-TO-SOUTH-SHORE-LINE "Rail Rangers Return to the South Shore Line"] ''New Carlisle Gazette''. Retrieved 2018-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wisconsin Great Northern Railroad "Sky Parlour" Partnership ==
The Midwest Rail Rangers have a partnership agreement with the [[Wisconsin Great Northern Railroad]], which is located near [[Trego, Wisconsin|Trego]], [[Wisconsin]]. On select weekends in the spring, summer, and fall months, volunteers with the Midwest Rail Rangers present on-board educational programs aboard the railroad's Sky Parlour Car. What is now called the Wisconsin Great Northern's Sky Parlour Car once served as a [[Hi-Level]] [[lounge car]] on the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] (1956-1971), See-Level lounge car on [[Amtrak]] (1971-1995), and most recently as a Pacific Parlour Car on Amtrak's [[Coast Starlight]] train. The Rail Rangers present a free program for passengers that includes showing off various historical displays and artifacts about the historic railroad car.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apg-wi.com/spooner_advocate/free/historic-car-book-and-film-debut-in-wgn-s-fleet/article_146235d2-e385-11e9-9d57-77e48085ac75.html "Historic car, book, and film debut in WGN’s fleet"] ''Spooner Advocate''.

Retrieved 2019-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private Rail Excursions on Heritage Train Cars ==
The Midwest Rail Rangers also provide on-board educational programs to passengers on private rail excursions in the Upper Midwest, including through Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Many of these rail trips take place on historic privately-owned 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s rail equipment, such as dome cars and round-end observation cars, built for heritage railroad service. Currently, the Midwest Rail Rangers partner with Private Car Hollywood Beach (Keith White, owner), Friends of the 261, Zephyr Route Tours, American Rail Excursions, Paxrail, Friends of the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad, Iowa Pacific Railroad, and the 20th Century Railroad Club on private rail excursions. Services provided include live narration, route guide sheets, route guidebook (for purchase), and a Junior Ranger program for kids and teens aboard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20190723/submitted/190729669/ "Get tickets for historic train rides aboard 1950s observation car"] ''Chicago Daily Hearld''.

{{Aegean Express}}
The '''Aegean Express''', numbered as '''B31'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/files/bolgeseller/alsancakbalikesir.pdf Ege Ekspresi] - tcdd.gov.tr&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-tr|Ege Ekspresi}}), is a [[passenger train]] operating daily between [[İzmir Alsancak Terminal|Alsancak Terminal]] in [[İzmir]] to [[Balıkesir]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.neredennereye.com/tren-bileti/ege-ekspresi/ About the Ege Ekspres (Turkish)] - nerdennereye.com&lt;/ref&gt; The train operates as a local service on the route, calling at more stations than its counterpart, the [[Karesi Express]]; which also operates between İzmir and Balıkesir.

Originally the train operated between İzmir and [[Eskişehir]], via Balıkesir and [[Kütahya]], as a daily [[Inter-city rail|inter-city]] train. The route was then changed to [[Afyonkarahisar|Afyon]], also via Balıkesir and Kütahya and in 2013 it was shortened to a [[Regional rail|regional]] train service between İzmir and Balıkesir.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eksisozluk.com/ege-ekspresi--645485 Ege Ekspresi] - eksi sozluk.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The northbound ''Aegean Express'' departs İzmir in the morning at 6:50, arriving at Balıkesir just before noon at 11:50; while the southbound train departs Balıkesir at 14:00 and arrives in İzmir at 18:33.

The train mainly services small towns and villages along the Manisa-Bandırma railway.

==History==
The direct predecessor of the Aegean Express was the '''Aegean Mototren''', which operated between İzmir and Ankara between 1951 and 1978.&lt;ref name=MT5300&gt;{{cite web|last=Üstün |first=Çağatay |url=http://kentvedemiryolu.com/gecmis-zamanin-hiz-sampiyonu/ |title=Geçmiş Zamanın Hız Şampiyonu |website=kentvedemiyolu.com |language=Turkish |date=6 August 2011 |access-date=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Aegean Express'' was one of four daily trains operating between İzmir and Eskişehir. Out of these four trains, the ''Agean Express'' operated during the day, while the other three trains, ''[[Karesi Express]]'', ''[[9th of September Express]]'' and the ''[[İzmir Blue Train]]'', operated overnight and continued east from Eskişehir to [[Ankara]]. Scheduled departure from [[İzmir Basmane Terminal|Basmane Terminal]] in İzmir was at 6:45 and scheduled arrival in [[Eskişehir railway station|Eskişehir]] was at 18:25 while scheduled departure from Eskişehir was at 7:30 and scheduled arrival in İzmir was at 18:49, however the Aegean Express was famous for its delays and would arrive on average at its final destination 78 minutes late.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kentvedemiryolu.com/icerik.php?id=604 Average delays for passenger trains (Turkish)] - kentvedemiryolu.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Service to Basmane Terminal was suspended on 3 March 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izmir.bel.tr/HaberDetay/1999/tr Groundbreaking for the new Karsiyaka tunnel done with large fanfare] - Izmir belediyesi&lt;/ref&gt; due to the construction of the [[Karşıyaka tunnel]]. The ''Aegean Express'' terminated at [[Çiğli railway station|Çiğli]] ({{convert|17|km|abbr=on}} from Basmane Terminal), along with other trains from the north, and connection to railway stations in the city were offered by [[ESHOT]] replacement bus service. In early-2008 the İzmir terminus was pushed further north to [[Ulukent railway station|Ulukent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wowturkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=67309&amp;start=0 ESHOT TCDD service buses (Turkish)] - wowturkey.com&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, trains would layover at [[Menemen railway station|Menemen]]. Due to the rehabilitation of the [[Eskişehir-Konya railway]], the ''Aegean Express'' was cut back by {{convert|76|km|abbr=on}} to [[Kütahya railway station|Kütahya]] in July 2008. Two months later, in September 2008, the train was extended {{convert|105|km|abbr=on}} south to [[Afyon Ali Çetinkaya railway station|Afyon]] as a replacement to regional service between Alayunt and Afyon. On 25 May 2010, inter-city service from the north was brought back to center terminals in İzmir; however due to route changes, the ''Aegean Express'' would terminate at Alsancak Terminal instead of Basmane, along with all other trains from the north.

When construction to modernize the [[Balıkesir-Kütahya railway]] started in 2013, the ''Aegean Express'' was shorted by {{convert|256|km|abbr=on}} to [[Balıkesir]]. The ''Karesi Express'' was also shorted from Ankara to Balıkesir and currently operates as a regional train, along with the ''Aegean Express'', between İzmir and Balıkesir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yenihabergazetesi.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17637:balkesirli-25-yldr-tren-ile-ankaraya-gidemiyor&amp;catid=3:yen-haberler2&amp;Itemid=76 Karesi express shortened to Balikesir] - yenihabergazetesi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route details==
The ''Aegean Express'' operates on the following railways in Turkey:

* [[İzmir–Afyon railway]] - Basmane terminal to [[Manisa]]
* [[Manisa-Bandırma railway]] - Manisa to Balıkesir
* [[Balıkesir-Kütahya railway]] - Balıkesir to Kütahya

In British railway parlance '''Dido''' trains were typically provided to transport workers to a remote place of railway employment on a '''D'''ay '''i'''n, '''d'''ay '''o'''ut basis.

The most common provision of this nature was to [[engine shed]]s away from centres of population where substantial numbers of staff would need to travel to or from work at times when other forms of public transport were not available. An example of this was the "Annesley Dido" which served the [[Great Central Railway]]-built Annesley engine shed north of [[Nottingham]] from at least 1929 to 8 September 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigkris21.tripod.com/id8.html |title=Railwayman's history of the Annesley Dido |website=Big Kris }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Beecroft|2008|p=20}}{{sfn|Grainger|2013|pp=7, 13, 25 &amp; 38-41 }}{{sfn|Jackson|Russell|1983|pp=130-142}}

A variant on this theme occurred to and from Langwith Junction engine shed in [[Derbyshire]]. This service was provided after Tuxford engine shed closed in 1959, when many Tuxford staff were transferred to work at Langwith Junction.{{sfn|Little|2002|p=11}}{{sfn|Stewart-Smith|2016b|p=23}}

==Workmen's trains==
Dido trains were a variant within the broad class of ''workmen's trains'' which were provided by railways from their early days until well after the [[Second World War]]. Such trains ran to meet the needs of people working at establishments with significant numbers signing on and off at given times, such as collieries, factories, quarries, docks and railway workshops. Such trains were often made up of substandard coaching stock{{sfn|Baughan|1991|p=87}} hauled by ancient locomotives,{{sfn|Jackson|Russell|1983|pp=136-142}} with occasional exceptions when a service's customary locomotive was indisposed.{{sfn|Anderson|1973|p=156}} By the nature of their destinations such trains often required special platforms or other stopping places, which usually did not appear on public timetables and did not cater for the general public. Like the rolling stock, these stations were typically substandard, amounting in some cases to an agreed stopping point where users clambered to and from the trackside.{{sfn|Croughton|Kidner|Young|1982|pp=3-16}}

Where public stations existed near places of employment some workmen's trains called, usually not shown on the station's public timetable.{{sfn|Boyd|1988|p=87}} Occasionally workmen's carriages were attached to regular service trains.{{sfn|Prideaux|1982|p=21}}

Whatever the variety of workmen's service used, passengers bought "workmen's tickets" at significantly reduced fares.{{sfn|Green|2016|p=328}}

==Examples==
Many workmen's services existed over the years. Examples were provided by:

'''Train noise''' is [[vehicle noise]] created by [[train]]s. Noises may be heard inside the train and outside. Various parts of a train produce noise, and different kinds of [[train wheel]]s produce different amounts of noise. [[Noise barrier]]s can attenuate these noises.

Subway systems, [[light rail]] transit and [[Rail freight transport|freight trains]] can send loud train noise into neighborhoods. Organizations such as the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] have set guidelines for noise level decibel limits for [[rapid transit]].

* Train noise can be a type of [[Noise (environmental)|environmental noise]]. When a train is moving, there are several distinct sounds, such as the [[locomotive]] engine noise and the wheels turning on the [[rail tracks|railroad track]].  The air displacement of a train in a tunnel can create noise from [[turbulence]].
* Trains also employ [[train horn|horns]], [[steam whistle|whistle]]s, [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s, and other noisemaking devices for both communication and warning.
* Trains propelled by electric traction motors often produce [[electromagnetically induced acoustic noise and vibration|electromagnetically induced noise]]. This high-pitch noise depends on the speed and torque level of the machine, as well as the motor type.&lt;ref&gt;"J. Le Besnerais et al., Characterization of the audible magnetic noise emitted by traction motors in railway rolling stock", Noise Control Engineering Journal, ISSN 0736-2501, Vol. 57, Nº. 5, 2009, págs. 391-399&lt;/ref&gt; [[Variable-frequency drive|Variable-frequency drives]] use [[pulse-width modulation]], which introduces additional current harmonics and results in higher acoustic noise. The switching frequency of the PWM can be asynchronous (independent of speed) or synchronous (proportional to speed), but always results in acoustic noise varying with speed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Le Besnerais, V. Lanfranchi, M. Hecquet and P. Brochet, "Characterization and Reduction of Audible Magnetic Noise Due to PWM Supply in Induction Machines," in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, vol. 57, no. 4, pp. 1288-1295, April 2010.
doi: 10.1109/TIE.2009.2029529&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internal combustion engine]]-powered trains, such as [[Diesel train|diesels]], can produce noise from their own [[Powerplant|power plants]], too.
*[[Rail squeal]] is a sound caused by a train&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Train wheel|wheels]] skidding under specific conditions.
* Roughness and irregularities on the wheel and rail surfaces are a source of noise and vibration. [[Track (rail transport)#Joining rails|Rail joints]] and squats on the rail cause a familiar "clickety-clack" sound as train wheels roll over them. [[Railgrinder#Rail corrugation|Rail corrugation]] (a periodic wear pattern resembling corrugated materials) causes tonal noise and vibration; fine, short-wavelength corrugation is known as "roaring rails" due to its high-pitched sound, whereas coarse, long-wavelength corrugation can cause the ground and nearby buildings to vibrate.

Diesel-electric locomotives have various sounds associated with them, although in more recent years newer locomotives have become much quieter due to Federally-mandated noise regulations. However, there are still times that a locomotive may develop a defect in its turbocharger, which produces a whine that can be heard for many miles. While this is rare, and usually the said locomotive gets put into the shop quickly, the noise has been compared to an air raid siren, a UFO, or just a very large leaf blower. It appears to be the most common on EMD units equipped with the 710 prime mover, although any turbocharged locomotive may develop this problem.

Where multiple trains are used on the same route to convey an excess of freight or passengers, the trains will be defined as "first section," "second section," "third section," etc. to differentiate the vehicles for dispatching. Although it was not always the case that the first section travelled first, this naming and travel sequence was generally followed by convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-kaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=train+%22second+section%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBz_X_-5TRAhWGYiYKHeLpDZ0Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=train%20%22second%20section%22&amp;f=false| via=Google Books| journal=The Railway Conductor| volume=XXXVIII| date=April 1921| issue=4| title=Forum of Train Rules: Sanford, Fla.| page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Trains with common start points and multiple destinations
* The ''[[Rocky Mountain Rocket]]'' passenger train of the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]] was operated in multiple sections. The two sections were combined from Chicago to [[Limon, Colorado]], where they were split into sections and subsequently operated as two trains, one to Denver and one to Colorado Springs. The process was reversed for the eastbound direction as the two sections were combined in Limon for the trip to Chicago. The Rock Island commissioned construction of the [[EMC AB6|AB6]] locomotive specifically for this service.&lt;ref name=Pinkepank123&gt;{{Pinkepank diesel spotters guide 2|page=EMD-123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orphan Train.jpg|thumb|Orphan train]]
The '''Orphan Train Movement''' was a supervised welfare program that transported orphaned and homeless children from crowded Eastern cities of the United States to foster homes located largely in rural areas of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The orphan trains operated between 1854 and 1929, relocating about 200,000 orphaned, abandoned, abused, or homeless children.

Three charitable institutions, [[Children's Village]] (founded 1851 by 24 philanthropists),&lt;ref name=NYT-1860&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/31/news/our-city-charities-no-ii-the-new-york-juvenile-asylum.html?pagewanted=all|title=OUR CITY CHARITIES--NO. II.; The New-York Juvenile Asylum.|work=[[New York Times]]|date=January 31, 1860|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}
*&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; "...from the most careful inquiry, they regard suited to have the charge of such children. '''Six years of experience''' have increased their caution and watchfulness in this matter, and they now require such guarantees on the part of the masters as will, in their judgment, most conduce to the good of their wards. Regular reports are required both from the children and their masters, and the agent of the asylum visits the greater part of the children when making his trips to locate new companies. In this way, very few are lost sight of, and the results thus far, in the case of those indentured within two years past, are very gratifying."  — ¶ 13
*&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; "On the 30th of June, 1851, the act of incorporation was passed. The corporators named in the act were [[Robert Bowne Minturn|Robert B. Minturn]], [[Myndert Van Schaick]], Robert M. Stratton, Solomon Jenner, Albert Gilbert, Stewart Brown, [[Francis R. Tillou]], David S. Kennedy, Joseph B. Collins, [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (lawyer)|Benjamin F. Butler]], [[Isaac Hopper|Isaac T. Hopper]], Charles Partridge, [[Luther Bradish]], Christopher Y.

Winston, James Kelly, Silas C. Herring, Rensselaer N. Havens, and [[John W. Edmonds]]" — ¶ 7&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Children's Aid Society]] (established 1853 by [[Charles Loring Brace]]) and later, the [[The New York Foundling|New York Foundling Hospital]], endeavored to help these children.  The institutions were supported by wealthy donors and operated by professional staff. The three institutions developed a program that placed homeless, orphaned, and abandoned city children, who numbered an estimated 30,000 in New York City alone in the 1850s, in foster homes throughout the country. The children were transported to their new homes on [[train]]s that were labeled "orphan trains" or "baby trains".  This relocation of children ended in the 1920s with the beginning of organized [[foster care]] in America.

==Background==
[[File:CharlesLoringBrace.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Loring Brace]]

The first [[orphanage]] in the United States was reportedly established in 1729 in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez, MS]],&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/horizon/nov98/orphan.htm Warren, Andrea. "The Orphan Train", ''The Washington Post'', 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; but institutional orphanages were uncommon before the early 19th century. Relatives or neighbors usually raised children who had lost parents. Arrangements were informal and rarely involved courts.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;

Around 1830, the number of homeless children in large Eastern cities such as New York City exploded.  In 1850, there were an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 homeless children in New York City.  At the time, New York City's population was only 500,000.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; Some children were orphaned when their parents died in epidemics of typhoid, yellow fever or the flu.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; Others were abandoned due to poverty, illness or addiction.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;  Many children sold matches, rags, or newspapers to survive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/orphan/|title=American Experience . The Orphan Trains {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For protection against street violence, they banded together and formed gangs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1853, a young minister named [[Charles Loring Brace]] became concerned with the plight of street children (often known as "street Arabs").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He founded the Children's Aid Society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  During its first year the Children's Aid Society primarily offered boys religious guidance and vocational and academic instruction. Eventually, the society established the nation's first runaway shelter, the Newsboys' Lodging House, where vagrant boys received inexpensive room and board and basic education. Brace and his colleagues attempted to find jobs and homes for individual children, but they soon became overwhelmed by the numbers needing placement. Brace hit on the idea of sending groups of children to rural areas for adoption.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/o/oconnor-01orphan.html|title=Orphan Trains|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brace believed that street children would have better lives if they left the poverty and debauchery of their lives in New York City and were instead raised by morally upright farm families.&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;[http://www.childrensaidsociety.org/about/history "History", Children's Aid Society]&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognizing the need for labor in the expanding farm country, Brace believed that farmers would welcome homeless children, take them into their homes and treat them as their own. His program would turn out to be a forerunner of modern foster care.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After a year of dispatching children individually to farms in nearby Connecticut, Pennsylvania and rural New York, the Children's Aid Society mounted its first large-scale expedition to the Midwest in September 1854.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-09-28/features/8602270532_1_charles-loring-brace-orphan-trains-noah-lawyer|title=Trains Ferried Waifs To New Lives On The Prairie|newspaper=tribunedigital-sunsentinel|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The term "Orphan Train" ==
The phrase "orphan train" was first used in 1854 to describe the transportation of children from their home area via the railroad.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S.|first=Trammell, Rebecca|date=2009-01-01|title=Orphan Train Myths and Legal Reality|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/tma/vol5/iss2/3/|journal=The Modern American|volume=5|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term "Orphan Train" was not widely used until long after the Orphan Train program had ended.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Children's Aid Society referred to its relevant division first as the Emigration Department, then as the Home-Finding Department, and finally, as the Department of Foster Care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Later, the New York Foundling Hospital sent out what it called "baby" or "mercy" trains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Organizations and families generally used the terms "family placement" or "out-placement" ("out" to distinguish it from the placement of children "in" orphanages or asylums) to refer to orphan train passengers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Widespread use of the term "orphan train" may date to 1978, when [[CBS]] aired a fictional miniseries entitled The Orphan Trains. One reason the term was not used by placement agencies was that less than half of the children who rode the trains were in fact orphans, and as many as 25 percent had two living parents. Children with both parents living ended up on the trains — or in orphanages — because their families did not have the money or desire to raise them or because they had been abused or abandoned or had run away. And many teenage boys and girls went to orphan train sponsoring organizations simply in search of work or a free ticket out of the city.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The term "orphan trains" is also misleading because a substantial number of the placed-out children didn't take the railroad to their new homes and some didn't even travel very far. The state that received the greatest number of children (nearly one-third of the total) was New York. Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania also received substantial numbers of children. For most of the orphan train era, the Children's Aid Society bureaucracy made no distinction between local placements and even its most distant ones. They were all written up in the same record books and, on the whole, managed by the same people. Also, the same child might be placed one time in the West and the next time — if the first home did not work out — in New York City. The decision about where to place a child was made almost entirely on the basis of which alternative was most readily available at the moment the child needed help.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The first Orphan Train ==
The first group of 45 children arrived in [[Dowagiac, Michigan]], on October 1, 1854.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The children had traveled for days in uncomfortable conditions.  They were accompanied by E. P. Smith of the Children's Aid Society.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Smith himself had let two different passengers on the riverboat from Manhattan adopt boys without checking their references.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FMUlOcn61q4C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=boston+orphan+train+little+wanderers#v=onepage&amp;q=boston%20orphan%20train%20little%20wanderers&amp;f=false|title=Orphan Trains: The Story of Charles Loring Brace and the Children He Saved and Failed|last=O'Connor|first=Stephen|date=2004-03-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226616674|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith added a boy he met in the Albany railroad yard — a boy whose claim to orphanhood Smith never bothered to verify.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At a meeting in Dowagiac, Smith played on his audience's sympathy while pointing out that the boys were handy and the girls could be used for all types of housework.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In an account of the trip published by the Children's Aid Society, Smith said that in order to get a child, applicants had to have recommendations from their pastor and a justice of the peace, but it is unlikely that this requirement was strictly enforced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  By the end of that first day, fifteen boys and girls had been placed with local families.  Five days later, twenty-two more children had been adopted.  Smith and the remaining eight children traveled to Chicago where Smith put them on a train to Iowa City by themselves where a Reverend C. C. Townsend, who ran a local orphanage, took them in and attempted to find them foster families.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This first expedition was considered such a success that in January 1855 the society sent out two more parties of homeless children to Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Logistics of Orphan Trains==
[[File:Orphan train flyer.jpg|thumb|Orphan train flyer]]

Committees of prominent local citizens were organized in the towns where orphan trains stopped.  These committees were responsible for arranging a site for the adoptions, publicizing the event, and arranging lodging for the orphan train group.  These committees were also required to consult with the Children's Aid Society on the suitability of local families interested in adopting children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Brace's system put its faith in the kindness of strangers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/orphan/orphants.html|title=American Experience . The Orphan Trains {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Orphan train children were placed in homes for free and were expected to serve as an extra pair of hands to help with chores around the farm.&lt;ref name="cas" /&gt;  Families expected to raise them as they would their natural-born children, providing them with decent food and clothing, a "common" education, and $100 when they turned twenty-one.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   Older children placed by The Children's Aid Society were supposed to be paid for their labors.&lt;ref name="cas" /&gt;  Legal adoption was not required.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

According to the Children's Aid Society's "Terms on Which Boys are Placed in Homes," boys under twelve were to be "treated by the applicants as one of their own children in matters of schooling, clothing, and training," and boys twelve to fifteen were to be "sent to a school a part of each year."&lt;ref name="dan"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2007/novemberdecember/feature/lost-children-riders-the-orphan-train Scheuerman, Dan. "Lost Children: Riders on the Orphan Train", ''Humanities'', November/December 2007 | Volume 28, Number 6]&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from the society were supposed to visit each family once a year to check conditions, and children were expected to write letters back to the society twice a year.&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt;  There were only a handful of agents to monitor thousands of placements.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Before they boarded the train, children were dressed in new clothing, given a Bible and placed in the care of Children's Aid Society agents who accompanied them west.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;  Few children understood what was happening.  Once they did, their reactions ranged from delight at finding a new family to anger and resentment at being &lt;nowiki&gt;''placed out'' when they had relatives ''back home.''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;

Most children on the trains were white.  An attempt was made to place non-English speakers with people who spoke their language.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; German-speaking [[Bill Landkamer]] rode an orphan train several times as a preschooler in the 1920s before being accepted by a German family in Nebraska.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;

Babies were easiest to place, but finding homes for children older than 14 was always difficult because of concern that they were too set in their ways or might have bad habits.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;  Children who were physically or mentally disabled or sickly were difficult to find homes for.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;  Although many siblings were sent out together on orphan trains, prospective parents could choose to take a single child, separating siblings.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcphersonsentinel.com/news/20161116/orphan-trains-focus-of-upcoming-program|title=Orphan trains focus of upcoming program|last=Writer|first=Patricia Middleton Staff|newspaper=McPhersonSentinel|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many orphan train children went to live with families that placed orders specifying age, gender, and hair and eye color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2015/09/30/they-survived-minnesotas-orphan-trains-to-celebrate-life/|title=They survived Minnesota's orphan trains to celebrate life – Twin Cities|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were paraded from the depot into a local playhouse, where they were put up on stage, thus the origin of the term "up for adoption."&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt;  According to an exhibit panel from the National Orphan Train Complex, the children "took turns giving their names, singing a little ditty, or 'saying a piece."&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt;  According to Sara Jane Richter, professor of history at Oklahoma Panhandle State University, the children often had unpleasant experiences. "People came along and prodded them, and looked, and felt, and saw how many teeth they had."&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt;

Press accounts convey the spectacle, and sometimes auction-like atmosphere, attending the arrival of a new group of children. &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Some ordered boys, others girls, some preferred light babies, others dark, and the orders were filled out properly and every new parent was delighted,&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; reported ''The Daily Independent'' of [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island, NE]] in May 1912. &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;They were very healthy tots and as pretty as anyone ever laid eyes on.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;

Brace raised money for the program through his writings and speeches. Wealthy people occasionally sponsored trainloads of children.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; Charlotte Augusta Gibbs, wife of [[John Jacob Astor III]], had sent 1,113 children west on the trains by 1884.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Railroads gave discount fares to the children and the agents who cared for them.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;

== Scope of the Orphan Train movement ==
The Children's Aid Society's sent an average of 3,000 children via train each year from 1855 to 1875.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;  Orphan trains were sent to 45 states, as well as Canada and Mexico. During the early years, Indiana received the largest number of children.&lt;ref name="cas" /&gt;  At the beginning of the Children's Aid Society orphan train program, children were not sent to the southern states, as Brace was an ardent abolitionist.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

By the 1870s, the New York Foundling Hospital and the New England Home for Little Wanderers in Boston all had orphan train programs of their own.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== New York Foundling Hospital "Mercy Trains" ==
{{Main|New York Foundling}}
The [[New York Foundling]] Hospital was established in 1869 by [[Sister Irene|Sister Mary Irene Fitzgibbon]] of the [[Sisters of Charity of New York]] as a shelter for abandoned infants. The Sisters worked in conjunction with Priests throughout the Midwest and South in an effort to place these children in Catholic families. The Foundling Hospital sent infants and toddlers to prearranged Roman Catholic homes from 1875 to 1914.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; Parishioners in the destination regions were asked to accept children, and parish priests provided applications to approved families.  This practice was first known as the "Baby Train," then later the "Mercy Train."  By the 1910s, 1,000 children a year were placed with new families.&lt;ref&gt;Dianne Creagh, "The Baby Trains: Catholic Foster Care and Western Migration, 1873-1929," ''Journal of Social History'' (2012) 46#1 pp 197-218 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_social_history/v046/46.1.creagh.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges faced by Orphan Train passengers and families ==
Linda McCaffery, a professor at Barton County Community College, explained the range of Orphan Train experiences: "Many were used as strictly slave farm labor, but there are stories, wonderful stories of children ending up in fine families that loved them, cherished them, [and] educated them."&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt;

Orphan train children faced obstacles ranging from prejudice of classmates because they were &lt;nowiki&gt;''train children''&lt;/nowiki&gt; to feeling like outsiders in their families all their lives.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;  Many rural people viewed the orphan train children with suspicion, as incorrigible offspring of drunkards and prostitutes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Criticisms of the orphan train movement focused on concerns that initial placements were made hastily, without proper investigation, and that there was insufficient follow-up on placements.  Charities were also criticized for not keeping track of children placed while under their care.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In 1883, Brace consented to an independent investigation. It found the local committees were ineffective at screening foster parents. Supervision was lax. Many older boys had run away. But its overall conclusion was positive. The majority of children under fourteen were leading satisfactory lives.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Applicants for children were supposed to be screened by committees of local businessmen, ministers, or physicians, but the screening was rarely very thorough.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Small-town ministers, judges, and other local leaders were often reluctant to reject a potential foster parent as unfit if he were also a friend or customer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many children lost their identity through forced name changes and repeated moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/child_law/orphan-train.html|title=Orphan Train|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, Alice Ayler said, "I was one of the luckier ones because I know my heritage. They took away the identity of the younger riders by not allowing contact with the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsok.com/article/2542773|title=Students Learn About Orphan Train|date=1996-06-12|newspaper=NewsOK.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many children placed out west had survived on the streets of New York, Boston or other large eastern cities and generally they were not the obedient children many families expected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In 1880, a Mr. Coffin of Indiana editorialized, "Children so thrown out from the cities are a source of much corruption in the country places where they are thrown... Very few such children are useful."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Po3FdgqOw4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=orphan+train+slavery#v=onepage&amp;q=orphan%20train%20&amp;f=false|title=Little Strangers: Portrayals of Adoption and Foster Care in America, 1850-1929|last=Nelson|first=Claudia|date=2003-05-13|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253109809|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some placement locations charged that orphan trains were dumping undesirable children from the East on Western communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;   In 1874, the National Prison Reform Congress charged that these practices resulted in increased correctional expenses in the West.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Older boys wanted to be paid for their labor, sometimes asking for additional pay or leaving a placement to find a higher paying placement. It is estimated that young men initiated 80% of the placement changes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

One of the many children who rode the train was Lee Nailling. Lee's mother died of sickness; after her death Lee's father could not afford to keep his children. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
Another orphan train child was named Alice Ayler. Alice rode the train because her single mother could not provide for her children; before the journey they lived off of "berries" and "green water."{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Catholic clergy maintained that some charities were deliberately placing Catholic children in Protestant homes to change their religious practices.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The Society for the Protection of Destitute Roman Catholic Children in the City of New York (known as the Protectory) was founded in 1863.  The Protectory ran orphanages and place out programs for Catholic youth in response to Brace's Protestant-centered program.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Similar charges of conversion via adoption were made concerning the placement of Jewish children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Not all orphan train children were true orphans, but were made into orphans by forced removal from their biological families to be placed out in other states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Some claimed this was a deliberate pattern intended to break up immigrant Catholic families.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Some abolitionists opposed placements of children with Western families, viewing indentureship as a form of slavery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Orphan trains were the target of lawsuits, generally filed by parents seeking to reclaim their children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Suits were occasionally filed by a receiving parent or family member claiming to have lost money or been harmed as the result of the placement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Minnesota State Board of Corrections and Charities reviewed Minnesota orphan train placements between 1880 and 1883. The Board found that while children were placed hastily and without proper investigation into their placements, only a few children were "depraved" or abused. The review criticized local committee members who were swayed by pressure from wealthy and important individuals in their community. The Board also pointed out that older children were frequently placed with farmers who expected to profit from their labor. The Board recommended that paid agents replace or supplement local committees in investigating and reviewing all applications and placements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A complicated lawsuit arose from a 1904 Arizona Territory orphan train placement in which the New York Foundling Hospital sent 40 Caucasian children between the ages of 18 months and 5 years to be indentured to Catholic families in an Arizona Territory parish. The families approved by the local priest for placement were identified in the subsequent litigation as "Mexican Indian." Nuns escorting these children were unaware of the racial tension between local Anglo and Mexican groups, and placed Caucasian children with Mexican Indian families. A group of white men, described as "just short of a lynch mob," forcibly took the children from the Mexican Indian homes and placed most of them with Anglo families. Some of the children were returned to the Foundling Hospital, but 19 remained with the Anglo Arizona Territory families. The Foundling Hospital filed a writ of habeas corpus seeking the return of these children. The Arizona Supreme Court held that the best interests of the children required that they remain in their new Arizona homes. On appeal, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] found that a writ of habeas corpus seeking the return of a child constituted an improper use of the writ. Habeas corpus writs should be used "solely in cases of arrest and forcible imprisonment under color or claim of warrant of law," and should not be used to obtain or transfer custody of children. These events were well publicized at the time with newspaper stories titled "Babies Sold Like Sheep," telling readers that the New York Foundling Hospital "has for years been shipping children in car-loads all over the country, and they are given away and sold like cattle."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== End of the Orphan Train movement ==
As the West was settled, the demand for adoptable children declined.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Additionally, Midwestern cities such as Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis began to experience the neglected children problems that New York, Boston and Philadelphia had experienced in the mid-1800s. These cities began to seek ways to care for their own orphan populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1895, Michigan passed a statute prohibiting out-of-state children from local placement without payment of a bond guaranteeing that children placed in Michigan would not become a public charge in the State.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Similar laws were passed by Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri and Nebraska.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Negotiated agreements between one or more New York charities and several western states allowed the continued placement of children in these states. Such agreements included large bonds as security for placed children. In 1929, however, these agreements expired and were not renewed as charities changed their child care support strategies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lastly, the need for the orphan train movement decreased as legislation was passed providing in-home family support. Charities began developing programs to support destitute and needy families limiting the need for intervention to place out children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Legacy of the program ==
Between 1854 and 1929, an estimated 200,000 American children traveled west by rail in search of new homes.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;

The Children's Aid Society rated its transplanted wards successful if they grew into "creditable members of society," and frequent reports documented the success stories. A 1910 survey concluded that 87 percent of the children sent to country homes had "done well," while 8 percent had returned to New York and the other 5 percent had either died, disappeared or gotten arrested.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Brace's notion that children are better cared for by families than in institutions is the most basic tenet of present-day foster care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Pre-war==
The first mass deportation of Jews from Nazi Germany occurred in less than a year before the outbreak of war. It was the forcible eviction of German Jews with Polish citizenship fuelled by the ''[[Kristallnacht]]''. Approximately 30,000 Jews were rounded up and sent via rail to refugee camps. In July 1938, both the United States and Britain at the [[Évian Conference]] in France refused to accept any more Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref name="YV1938"&gt;{{Citation|author=Yad Vashem |title=Nazi Germany and the Jews 1933-1939 |year=2014 |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/crucial_year.asp |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140207012203/http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/crucial_year.asp |archivedate=2014-02-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Government]] agreed to take in the shipment of children arranged by the [[Kindertransport]] scheme, some 10,000 eventually arriving in the UK.

==The role of railways in the Final Solution==
[[File:Birkenau gate.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Entrance, or so-called "death gate", to Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the extermination camp]]
Within various phases of [[the Holocaust]], the trains were employed differently. At first, they were used to [[Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland|concentrate the Jewish populations in the ghettos]], and often to transport them to [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] and [[German camps in occupied Poland during World War II|German concentration camps]] for the purpose of economic exploitation.&lt;ref name="ushmm-7445"&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/sp/article.php?ModuleId=10007445 Types of Ghettos. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hilberg"/&gt; In 1939, for logistical reasons, the Jewish communities in settlements without railway lines in [[occupied Poland]] were dissolved.&lt;ref name="holocaustchronicle"&gt;[http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/staticpages/176.html "1939: The War Against The Jews."] ''The Holocaust Chronicle'' published by Publications International, April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1941, about 3.5 million [[Polish Jews]] had been segregated and ghettoised by the ''[[SS]]'' in a massive deportation action involving the use of freight trains.&lt;ref name="Berenbaum"&gt;[[Michael Berenbaum]], ''The World Must Know'', [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], 2006, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent ghettos had direct railway connections, because the food aid (paid for by the Jews themselves) was completely dependent on the ''SS'', similar to all newly built labour camps.&lt;ref name="holocaust-education.dk"&gt;Peter Vogelsang &amp; Brian B. M. Larsen, [http://www.holocaust-education.dk/holocaust/ghettoer.asp "The Ghettos of Poland."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022181155/http://www.holocaust-education.dk/holocaust/ghettoer.asp |date=2013-10-22 }} ''The Danish Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies''. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were legally banned from baking bread.&lt;ref name="Edelman-upenn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/Holocaust/warsaw-uprising.html |title=The Ghetto Fights |publisher=Literature of the Holocaust, at the University of Pennsylvania |work=The Warsaw Ghetto: The 45th Anniversary of the Uprising |author=Marek Edelman}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were sealed off from the general public in hundreds of virtual prison-islands called ''Jüdische Wohnbezirke'' or ''Wohngebiete der Juden''. However, the new system was unsustainable. By the end of 1941, most ghettoised Jews had no savings left to pay the ''SS'' for further bulk food deliveries.&lt;ref name="holocaust-education.dk"/&gt; The quagmire was resolved at the [[Wannsee conference]] of 20 January 1942 near [[Berlin]], where the "Final Solution of the Jewish question" (''die Endlösung der Judenfrage'') was set in place.&lt;ref name="Furet"&gt;[[François Furet]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=02PpAAAACAAJ Unanswered Questions: Nazi Germany and the Genocide of the Jews]''. Schocken Books (1989), p. 182; {{ISBN|0-8052-4051-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[euphemism]] referring to the Nazi plan for the annihilation of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web |title='Final Solution': Overview |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005151 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302130042/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005151 |archive-date=2 March 2013 |publisher= United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |author=Holocaust Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the liquidation of the ghettos starting in 1942, the trains were used to transport the condemned populations to death camps. To implement the "Final Solution", the Nazis made their own ''Deutsche Reichsbahn'' an indispensable element of the mass extermination machine, wrote historian [[Raul Hilberg]].&lt;ref name="Hilberg"&gt;{{cite journal |title=German Railroads / Jewish Souls |journal=The Role of the German Railroads in the Destruction of the Jews |volume = 35|issue=2 |pages=162–174 |author=Raul Hilberg|doi=10.1007/BF02838139 |year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the prisoner trains took away valuable track space, they allowed for the mass scale and shortened duration over which the extermination needed to take place. The fully enclosed nature of the locked and windowless cattle wagons greatly reduced the number and skill of troops required to transport the condemned Jews to their destinations. The use of railroads enabled the Nazis to lie about the "resettlement program" and, at the same time, build and operate more efficient gassing facilities which required limited supervision.&lt;ref name="explained.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theholocaustexplained.org/ks3/the-camps/daily-life/journeys/ |title=Deportation and transportation |publisher=London Jewish Cultural Centre |work=The Holocaust Explained |year=2011 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis disguised their "Final Solution" as the mass "resettlement to the east". The victims were told they were being taken to labour camps in [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]]. In reality, from 1942 on, for most Jews, deportations meant only death at either [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibór]], [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]], [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]], or [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. Some trains that had already transported goods to the Eastern front on their return carried human cargo bound for extermination camps.&lt;ref name="chronicle.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/staticpages/415.html |title=Reichsbahn |publisher=Publications International |work=Death and Resistance |accessdate=6 February 2014 |author=The Holocaust Chronicle |page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was being realized in the utmost secrecy. In late 1942, during a telephone conversation, Hitler's private secretary [[Martin Bormann]] admonished [[Heinrich Himmler]], who was informing him about 50,000 Jews already exterminated in a concentration camp in Poland. "They were not exterminated – Bormann screamed – only evacuated, evacuated, evacuated!", and slammed down the phone, wrote Enghelberg.&lt;ref name="Enghelberg"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/HOLOCAUST-transport-companies-agreement-operation-ebook/dp/B004C44N58/ref=sr_1_10?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391784099&amp;sr=1-10#reader_B004C44N58 |title=The trains of the Holocaust |publisher=Kindle Edition | author=Hedi Enghelberg |year=2013 |page=63 |isbn=978-160585-123-5 |quote=[http://www.enghelberg.com/EDICIONES/trains_holocaust.htm Book excerpts] from Enghelberg.com.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale of the need for mass transportation===
[[File:WW2-Holocaust-Europe.png|thumb|250px|right|General map of deportation routes and camps]]
Following the [[Wannsee Conference]] of 1942, the Nazis began to murder the Jews in large numbers at newly built death camps of [[Operation Reinhard]]. Since 1941, the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', mobile extermination squads, were already conducting mass shootings of Jews in the [[Kresy|Eastern territories]] which were occupied earlier by the [[Soviet Union]], as well as east of the 1939 Soviet borders .&lt;ref name="Rossino-89"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rossino|first=Alexander B.|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctv1rmk6w|title=Polin: Studies in Polish Jewry Volume 16: Focusing on Jewish Popular Culture and Its Afterlife|date=2003-11-01|publisher=The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization|year=|isbn=978-1-909821-67-5|editor-last=Steinlauf|editor-first=Michael C.|location=|pages=431–452|chapter=“Polish ‘Neighbours’ and German Invaders: Anti-Jewish Violence in the Białystok District during the Opening Weeks of Operation Barbarossa.”|doi=10.2307/j.ctv1rmk6w.30|editor-last2=Polonsky|editor-first2=Antony}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of Western Europe were either deported to ghettos emptied through mass killings, such as the [[Rumbula massacre]] of the inhabitants of the [[Riga Ghetto]], or sent directly to Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibór, [[extermination camps]] built in spring and summer of 1942 only for gassing. Auschwitz II Birkenau gas chambers began operating in March. The last death camp, Majdanek, began operating them in late 1942.&lt;ref name="g-chambers"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Majdanek2.html | title=Gas Chambers at Majdanek | publisher=The American-Israeli Cooperative | work=Majdanek, Auschwitz II, Sobibor, Belzec and Treblinka | year=2009 | accessdate=11 February 2014 | author=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Wannsee, the ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]'' estimated that the "Final Solution" could ultimately eradicate up to 11&amp;nbsp;million European Jews; Nazi planners envisioned the inclusion of Jews living in neutral and non-occupied countries such as [[Ireland]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Deportations on this scale required the coordination of numerous German government ministries and state organisations, including the [[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt|Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA), the Transport Ministry, and the Foreign Office. The RSHA coordinated and directed the deportations; the Transport Ministry organized train schedules; and the Foreign Office negotiated with German-allied states and their railways about "processing" their own Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005445 German Railways and the Holocaust] at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the German spokesman for the ''[http://www.zug-der-erinnerung.eu/ Train of Commemoration]'' remembrance project, Hans-Rüdiger Minow, told [[The Jerusalem Post]] that from among the World War II railway staff and officials, there is "no word about those who committed the crimes" even though 200,000 train employees were involved in the rail deportations and "10,000 to 20,000 were responsible for mass murders". The railwaymen were never prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/No-Berlin-stop-for-Shoah-train |title=Mobile Holocaust exhibit forced to skip stop to ensure German railway system run on time |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |work=No Berlin stop for Shoah train |date=2008-04-17 |accessdate=5 February 2014 | author=Benjamin Weinthal, Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The journey==
[[File:Deportation of Jews from Slovakia, 1942.jpg|thumb|[[Hlinka Guard]]smen force Slovak Jews onto Holocaust trains, 1942]]

The first trains with German Jews expelled to ghettos in [[occupied Poland]] began departing from central Germany on 16 October 1941.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sg.geocities.com/raiha_evelyn/holocaust.html |title=The Holocaust |publisher=Raiha Evelyn |work=Concentration Camps &amp; Death Camps |accessdate=4 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723030423/http://sg.geocities.com/raiha_evelyn/holocaust.html |archivedate=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Called ''Sonderzüge'' (special trains),&lt;ref name="A2A"/&gt; the trains had low priority for the movement and would proceed to the mainline only after all other transports went through, inevitably extending transport time beyond expectations.&lt;ref name="A2A"/&gt;

The trains consisted of sets of either third class passenger carriages,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Nadel, [http://jewishmag.com/62mag/nadel/nadel.htm Recalling the Holocaust]&lt;/ref&gt; but mainly [[goods wagon|freight car]]s or [[Stock car (rail)|cattle car]]s or both; the latter packed with up to 150 deportees, although 50 was the number proposed by the ''SS'' regulations. No food or water was supplied. The ''Güterwagen'' boxcars were fitted with only a bucket [[latrine]]. A small barred window provided irregular ventilation, which oftentimes resulted in multiple deaths from either suffocation or exposure to the elements.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/25615/edition_id/498/format/html/displaystory.html |title=Holocaust survivor gives teens the straight story |publisher=Jewish news weekly of Northern California |date=April 22, 2005 |accessdate=5 February 2014 |author=Joshua Brandt |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126224024/http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/25615/edition_id/498/format/html/displaystory.html |archivedate=November 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some freight cars had a layer of [[Calcium oxide|quick lime]] on the floor.&lt;ref name="dcgr"&gt;[[Kurt Gerstein]], [http://www.deathcamps.org/belzec/gerstein.html "Gerstein Report" in English translation.] Tübingen, 4 May 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, the Germans did not have enough filled cars ready to start a major shipment of Jews to the camps,&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; so the victims were kept locked inside overnight at layover yards. The Holocaust trains also waited for military trains to pass.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; An average transport took about four days. The longest transport of the war, from [[Corfu]], took 18 days. When the train arrived at the camp and the doors were opened, everyone was already dead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

Due to delays and cramped conditions, many deportees died in transit. On 18 August 1942, ''Waffen SS'' officer [[Kurt Gerstein]] had witnessed at [[Bełżec extermination camp|Belzec]] the arrival of "45 wagons with 6,700 people, of whom 1,450 were already dead on arrival". That train came with the Jews of the [[Lwów Ghetto]],&lt;ref name="dcgr"/&gt; less than {{convert|100|km}} away.&lt;ref name="H.E.206"&gt;Holocaust Encyclopedia, [http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007206 "Belzec: Chronology"] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard means of delivery was a 10-metre long [[Goods wagon|freight car]], although third class [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger carriages]] were also used when the ''SS'' wanted to keep up the "resettlement to work in the East" myth, particularly in the Netherlands and in Belgium. The ''SS'' manual covered such trains, suggesting a carrying capacity per each trainset of 2,500 people in 50 cars, each boxcar loaded with 50 prisoners. In reality, however, boxcars were routinely loaded to 200% of capacity, or 100 people per car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndUAAQAAQBAJ |title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933-1945 |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2009 |accessdate=4 February 2014 |author=Geoffrey P. Megargee |page=1514 |isbn=978-0253003508}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in an average of 5,000 people per trainset. Notably, during the [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|mass deportation of Jews]] from the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] to [[Treblinka]] in 1942, trains carried up to 7,000 victims each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/this_month/resources/treblinka.asp |title=Treblinka: Railway Transports |publisher=Yad Vashem |work=This Month in Holocaust History |accessdate=4 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008222515/http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/this_month/resources/treblinka.asp |archivedate=8 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, over 1,600 trains were organised by the German Transport Ministry, and logged mainly by the Polish state railway company taken over by Germany, due to the majority of death camps being located in occupied Poland.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/Holocaust/black.html Edwin Black on IBM and the Holocaust]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1941 and December 1944, the official date of the closing of the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex, the transport/arrival timetable was 1.5 trains per day: 50 freight cars × 50 prisoners per freight car × 1,066 days = ~4,000,000 prisoners in total.&lt;ref name="Enghelberg"/&gt;

On 20 January 1943, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] sent a letter to [[Albert Ganzenmüller]], the Under-secretary of State at the Reich Transport Ministry, requesting: "need your help and support. If I am to wind things up quickly, I must have more trains."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neveragain.org/1943.htm |title=The Holocaust timeline: 1943 |publisher=NeverAgain.org, Internet Archive |accessdate=5 February 2014 |author=NAAF Project |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822061740/http://www.neveragain.org/1943.htm |archivedate=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the estimated 6 million Jews exterminated during World War II, 2 million were murdered on the spot by the military, [[Waffen-SS|political police]], and mobile death squads of the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' aided by the [[Ordnungspolizei#Police Battalions|Orpo battalions]] and their [[Hiwi (volunteer)|auxiliaries]]. The remainder were shipped to their deaths elsewhere.

===Payment===
Most of the Jews were forced to pay for their own deportations, particularly wherever passenger carriages were used. This payment came in the form of direct money deposit to the ''SS'' in light of the "resettlement to work in the East" myth. Charged in the ghettos for accommodation, adult Jews paid full price one-way tickets, while children under 10–12 years of age paid half price, and those under four went free. Jews who had run out of money were the first to be deported.&lt;ref name="RJB57"/&gt;

The ''SS'' forwarded part of this money to the German Transport Authority to pay the German Railways for transport of the Jews. The ''[[Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft|Reichsbahn]]'' was paid the equivalent of a third class railway ticket for every prisoner transported to his or her destination: 8,000,000 passengers, 4 [[Pfennig]] per track kilometer, times 600&amp;nbsp;km (average voyage length), equaled 240 million [[German Reichsmark|Reichsmark]]s.&lt;ref name="A2A"&gt;{{cite book |title=Approaches to Auschwitz |author1=Richard L.

The ''Reichsbahn'' pocketed both this money and its own share of the cash paid by the transported Jews after the ''SS'' fees. According to an expert report established on behalf of the German "Train of Commemoration" project, the receipts taken in by the state-owned ''Deutsche Reichsbahn'' for mass deportations in the period between 1938 and 1945 reached a sum of US $664,525,820.34.&lt;ref name="xyqom-Gutachten"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://xyqom.org/zde/Gutachten.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222145340/http://xyqom.org/zde/Gutachten.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-02-22 |title=Expert Report on the Deutsche Reichsbahn's Receipts |publisher=Train of Commemoration Registered, Non-Profit Association, Berlin |work=Obtained during the Nazi Dictatorship for Services in Transporting Persons from the German Reich and Occupied Areas of Europe to Concentration Camps |date=November 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2014 |author=Train of Commemoration |language=German, English, French, Polish |via=direct download 740 KB from Wayback Machine |quote=With payment summaries, tables and literature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations across Europe==
Powered mainly by efficient steam locomotives, the Holocaust trains were kept to a maximum of 55 [[freight car]]s on average, loaded from 150% to 200% capacity.&lt;ref name="Enghelberg"/&gt; The participation of German State Railway (the ''Deutsche Reichsbahn'') was crucial to the effective implementation of the "[[Final Solution|Final Solution of the Jewish Question]]". The DRB was paid to transport Jews and other victims of the Holocaust from thousands of towns and cities throughout Europe to meet their death in the [[Nazi concentration camp]] system.&lt;ref name="Enghelberg"/&gt;

As well as transporting German Jews, DRB was responsible for coordinating transports on the rail networks of occupied territories and Germany's allies. The characteristics of organized concentration and transportation of victims of the Holocaust varied by country.

===Belgium===

{{further|Hungarian Gold Train}}
The fascist government of [[Ferenc Szálasi]] issued a decree in April 1944 ordering all Jews under the Hungarian jurisdiction to "deposit" with the authorities their gems, gold jewellery, items made with the use of precious metals, and all valuables including Oriental carpets, silver, furs, paintings and fine furniture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/pcha/goldtrainfinaltoconvert.html The mystery of the Hungarian 'gold train'.] Eyelatch/Iwaniec Associates&lt;/ref&gt; These valuables were laden on a train consisting of 44 cars sent westward ahead of the Soviet advance. This train was seized in May 1945 by U.S. occupation troops in Austria. The Hungarian escort pushed the train into a tunnel near Boeckstein where it was found by the Americans who took control of the railway station in [[Werfen]]. Two Hungarian lorries were seized in the French sector. The goods were stored in [[Salzburg]].

On 9 September 1941, the parliament of the [[Slovak State]] ratified the Jewish Codex, a series of laws and regulations that stripped Slovakia's 89,000 Jews of their civil rights and means of economic survival. The ruling [[Slovak People’s Party]] paid 500 Reichsmarks per expelled Jew, in exchange for a promise that the deportees would never return to Slovakia. Except for  Croatia, Slovakia was the only Axis ally to pay for the deportation of its own Jewish population. Most of the Jewish population perished in two waves of deportations. The first, in 1942, took away two-thirds of the Slovak Jews; the second wave after the [[Slovak National Uprising]] in 1944 claimed another 13,500 victims, 10,000 of whom did not return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Rajcan |first1=Vanda |last2=Vadkerty |first2=Madeline |first3=Ján |last3=Hlavinka |entry=Slovakia|editor1-last=Megargee|editor1-first=Geoffrey P. |editorlink=Geoffrey P.

===Switzerland===
Switzerland was not invaded because its mountain bridges and tunnels between Germany and Italy were too vital for them to go into war.&lt;ref name="M.G. Jud-1"&gt;Markus G. Jud, [http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/switzerland-second-world-war-ii.html Switzerland's Role in World War II] at ''History of Switzerland''.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Swiss banks provided necessary access to international markets by dealing in pilfered gold.&lt;ref&gt;Markus G.

There exists substantial evidence that these shipments included Italian forced labour workers and trainloads of Jews in 1944 during the Nazi occupation of northern Italy,&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;David Marks, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/train/ The Train], BBC Frontline&lt;/ref&gt; when a German train passed through Switzerland every 10 minutes. The need for the tunnel was complicated by the British [[Royal Air Force]] having bombed and disrupted services through the Brenner Pass, as well as a heavy snowfall in the winter of 1944–45.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

Of 43 trains that could be tracked down by the 1996 [[Bergier Commission]], 39 went via Austria (Brenner, [[Tarvisio]]), one via France ([[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]]-[[Nice]]). The commission could not find any evidence that the other three passed through Switzerland. It is possible that the train could have been carrying [[dissident]]s back from concentration camps. Started in 1944, some repatriation trains went through Switzerland officially, organised by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].&lt;ref name="M.G. Jud-1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.uek.ch/en/index.htm Independent Commission of Experts, Switzerland—World War II''.] Bergier Commission for the Swiss Government&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the Soviet Army began making severe inroads into [[German-occupied Europe]] and the Allies landed in [[Normandy]] in June 1944, the number of trains and transported persons began to vary greatly. By November 1944, with the closure of Birkenau and the advance of the Soviet Army, the death trains had ceased. Conversely, the subsequent [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]] had the advantage of being able to utilize the forced labour to build defences.

As the Soviet and Allied Armies made their final pushes, the Nazis transported some of the concentration camp survivors either to other camps located inside the collapsing Third Reich, or to the border areas where they believed they could negotiate the release of captured Nazi [[Prisoners of War]] in return for the "Exchange Jews" or those that were born outside the Nazi occupied territories. Many of the inmates were transported via the infamous death marches, but among other transports three trains left Bergen-Belsen in April 1945 bound for [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]]—all were liberated.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

The last recorded train is the one used to transport the women of the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg March]], where for three days in March 1945 the remaining survivors were crammed into cattle cars to await further transport. Only 200 of the original 1000 women survived the entire trip to Bergen-Belsen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990203065157/http://www.neveragain.org/1945.htm NAAF Holocaust Project Timeline: 1945.] Never Again.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous national commemorations of the mass transportation of Jews in the "Final Solution" across Europe, as well as some lingering controversies surrounding the history of the railway systems utilized by the Nazis.

===Poland===
[[File:Umschlagplatz noc.JPG|thumb|left|Warsaw national monument to Holocaust trains at the former ''[[Umschlagplatz]]'' of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]]]

All railway lines leading to death camps built in occupied Poland are ceremonially cut off from the existing railway system in the country, similar to the well-preserved arrival point at Auschwitz known as the "Judenrampe" platform. The commemorative monuments are traditionally erected at collection points elsewhere. In 1988, a national monument was created at the ''[[Umschlagplatz]]'' of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. Designed by architect Hanna Szmalenberg and sculptor Władysław Klamerus, it consists of a stone structure symbolizing an open freight car.&lt;ref&gt;Sybille Steinbacher, ''Auschwitz: A History'', trans. by [[Shaun Whiteside]], Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-102142-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kraków]], the memorial to Jews from the [[Kraków Ghetto]] deported during the Holocaust spreads over the entire deportation site known as the Square of the Ghetto Heroes (''Plac Bohaterow Getta''). Inaugurated in December 2005, it consists of oversized steel chairs (each representing 1,000 victims), designed by architects Piotr Lewicki and Kazimierz Latak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishkrakow.net/en/see/krakow-ghetto/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724023814/http://www.jewishkrakow.net/en/see/krakow-ghetto/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 July 2011 |title=The Krakow Ghetto |publisher=JewishKrakow.net |accessdate=7 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the former [[Łódź Ghetto]], the monument was built at the [[Radegast train station]] (''Bahnhof Radegast''), where approximately 200,000 Polish, Austrian, German, Luxemburg and Czech Jews boarded the trains on the way to their deaths in the period from 16 January 1942, to 29 August 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrumdialogu.com/en/memorial/radegast-station |title=Memorial Radegast station |publisher=Centrum Dialogu im.

===Germany===
[[File:Holocaust memorial tree.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], Berlin]]

In 2004/2005, German historians and journalists began publicly demanding that at the German passenger train stations commemorative exhibits be set up, after the railroad companies in France and the Netherlands began commemorations of Nazi mass deportations in their own train stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/startseite/articleD84O6-1.177980 |title=Die Niederländische Bahn und die Judendeportatiopnen |publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |work=Der Centraal Joods Overleg, Amsterdam |date=19 October 2005 |accessdate=4 February 2014 |trans-title=The Dutch Railways and the deportation of Jews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Deutsche Bahn]]'' AG (DB AG), the state-owned successor of the ''Deutsche Reichsbahn'' replied: "we do not have either the personnel or the financial resources" for that kind of commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from the Deutsche Bahn AG, 17 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations then began at railway stations in [[Frankfurt am Main]] and in [[Cologne]] as well as inside the long-distance border-crossing trains.&lt;ref&gt;TV 3 sat: Kulturzeit, 10 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Because the DB AG had responded by having its security personnel repress the protests, German citizens' initiatives rented a historical steam locomotive and installed their own exhibition in remodeled passenger cars. This "Train of Commemoration" made its first journey on the 2007 International Holocaust Remembrance Day of January 27. The ''Deutsche Bahn'' AG refused it access to the main stations in Hamburg and Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/holocaust-deportation-exhibit-denied-access-to-berlin-central/a-3252599-1 |title=Holocaust Deportation Exhibit Denied Access to Berlin Central |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=8 April 2008 |accessdate=4 February 2014 |quote=''Following story:'' "Remembrance train banned from station".

Parliamentarians of all parties in the German national parliament called on the DB AG to rethink its behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Zug der Erinnerung, [http://www.zug-der-erinnerung.eu/appelle.html Verkehrsausschuss Deutscher Bundestag], 15 January 2008. {{in lang|de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Transport Minister [[Wolfgang Tiefensee]] proposed an exhibition by artist [[Jan Philipp Reemtsma]] on the railways' role in the deportation of 11,000 Jewish children to their deaths in Nazi concentration and extermination camps throughout World War II.

In 1992, [[SNCF]] commissioned a report on its involvement in World War II. The company opened its archives to an independent historian, Christian Bachelier, whose report was released in French in 2000.&lt;ref name="Bankier2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyMail2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=California set to force France's national rail service to reveal its Holocaust role as part of bid for $45m contract |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1291160/French-rail-operator-reveal-Holocaust-role-45bn-Californian-contract-bid.html#ixzz0sZ6U2128 |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated to English in 2010.&lt;ref name="Shaver"/&gt;

In 2001, a lawsuit was filed against [[Cabinet of France|French government]]-owned rail company SNCF by Georges Lipietz, a [[Holocaust survivor]], who was transported by SNCF to the [[Drancy internment camp]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="BBC2007"/&gt; Lipietz was held at the internment camp for several months before the camp was liberated.&lt;ref name=CBC2006&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/french-railway-must-pay-for-transporting-family-to-nazis-1.575679| title=French railway must pay for transporting family to Nazis| author=CBC News| accessdate=15 November 2012| date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Lipietz's death the lawsuit was pursued by his family and in 2006 an administrative court in [[Toulouse]] ruled in favor of the Lipietz family. SNCF was ordered to pay 61,000 Euros in restitution. SNCF appealed the ruling at an administrative appeals court in [[Bordeaux]], where in March 2007 the original ruling was overturned.&lt;ref name="BBC2007"&gt;{{cite news |title=French railways win WWII appeal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6499227.stm |newspaper=BBC |date=27 March 2007 |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters2007"&gt;{{cite news |title=Court quashes SNCF Nazi deportations ruling |last=Canellas |first=Claude |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/03/27/uk-france-holocaust-trial-idUKL2715470420070327 |newspaper=Reuters |date=27 March 2007 |accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Michael Marrus]], the court in Bordeaux "declared the railway company had acted under the authority of the Vichy government and the German occupation" and as such could not be held independently liable.&lt;ref name="Bankier2011"&gt;{{cite book |title=Holocaust and Justice |last=Marrus |first=Michael R. |editor1-last=Bankier |editor1-first=David |editor2-last=Michman |editor2-first=Dan |year=2011 |publisher=Berghahn Books |location= |isbn=978-9-65308-353-0 |chapter=Chapter 12: The Case of the French Railways and the Deportation of Jews in 1944 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Lipietz trial, SNCF's involvement in [[World War II]] became the subject of attention in the United States when SNCF explored bids on rail projects in Florida and California, and SNCF's partly owned subsidiary, [[Keolis|Keolis Rail Services America]] bid on projects in Virginia and Maryland.&lt;ref name="Shaver"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shaver |first=Katherine |title=Holocaust group faults VRE contract |work=The Washington Post |accessdate= 15 November 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/06/AR2010070605169.html |date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Keolis placed a bid on a contract to operate the Brunswick and Camden lines of the [[MARC train]] in Maryland.&lt;ref name="Shaver"/&gt; Following pressure from Holocaust survivors in Maryland, the state passed legislation in 2011 requiring companies bidding on the project to disclose their involvement in the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Zeitvogel2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=US governor signs Holocaust disclosure law |last1=Zeitvogel |first1=Karin |url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/51047 |newspaper=European Jewish Press |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414203445/http://www.ejpress.org/article/51047 |archivedate=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witte2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Md. governor signs bill on company's WWII role |last1=Witte |first1=Brian |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9NANRI81.htm |newspaper=Businessweek |date=19 May 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312084515/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9NANRI81.htm |archivedate=12 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keolis currently operates the [[Virginia Railway Express]], a contract the company received in 2010.&lt;ref name="Shaver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeitvogel2011"/&gt; In California, also in 2010, state lawmakers passed the Holocaust Survivor Responsibility Act.

While bidding on these rail contracts, SNCF was criticized for not formally acknowledging and apologizing for its involvement in World War II.

Between 2002 and 2004 the SNCF helped fund an exhibit on deportation of Jewish children that was organized by Nazi hunter [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld|Serge Klarsfeld]].&lt;ref name="Bankier2011"/&gt; In 2011, SNCF helped set up a railway station outside of Paris to a [[Shoah Foundation]] for the creation of a memorial to honor Holocaust victims.&lt;ref name="nytimes2011"/&gt; In December 2014, the company came to a $60 million compensation settlement with French Holocaust survivors living in the United States.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

A '''train graveyard''' (or '''cemetery''') is where [[train]]s and [[rolling stock]] are discarded while awaiting collection, recycling, or destruction. They might be abandoned and left to decay. The term can also be used to include [[tram]]s. Such [[vehicle graveyard]]s are distinguished from an [[abandoned railway]], which is a [[railway line]] that is no longer used for that purpose, and [[abandoned railway station]]s which are similarly disused. Some train graveyards attract visitors and can be a source of tourism, while others have had a role in preserving the history of the railways.

== Locations ==
[[File:" Last Train to No-where ".JPG|thumb|Former New York City transit locomotive, abandoned in Alaska]]

Some sites contain numerous trains that have been abandoned. In the United States, just outside [[Watervliet, New York]], there is the main line for the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]]. Alongside this railway line is a disused stretch of track which is home to rusted locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars.&lt;ref name="Lomo" /&gt; In [[North Carolina]], a graveyard features trains and trams from across the United States, including a passenger train from Philadelphia and abandoned [[Passenger car (rail)|subway cars]].&lt;ref name="Rumble" /&gt; Istvántelki Főműhely, formerly one of the most important railway repair workshops in Hungary, now lays disused with old rolling stock on site. Many of them were taken there to be repaired before being exhibited in the [[Hungarian Railway History Park]] in [[Budapest]] but never made it.&lt;ref name="AO" /&gt; One particularly sizable site is the [[Woodham Brothers]] scrapyard in [[Barry, Wales]], from which [[List of locomotives saved from Woodham Brothers scrapyard|213 of 297 locomotives]] were rescued by the nascent [[railway preservation]] movement.&lt;ref name="UGM" /&gt;. In [[Russia]], there is one in [[Shumkovo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anews.com.tr/webtv/world/shumkovos-soviet-railway-cemetery Shumkovo's Soviet railway cemetery]&lt;/ref&gt;. In Tangshan in north China there are rusting loocmotives on the sidings of now shut-down coal mines. A few have also been moved and exhibited in a Coal Mining Park and Railway museum. &lt;ref&gt;See Youtube slideshow by Chinarail1 in external links below&lt;/ref&gt;  

Trains can be abandoned in a location because it is deemed too difficult to move them. Two large steam locomotives of the [[Eagle Lake and West Branch Railroad]], for example, were left in a woodland area in the U.S. state of [[Maine]] after the end of a local logging operation because it was not practical to move them from such a remote location.&lt;ref name="Bangor" /&gt;

Train graveyards can be of interest to [[railfan]]s, [[urban exploration|urban explorers]], and other tourists. The "Cementerio de Trenes" ("train cemetery") near [[Uyuni]], [[Bolivia]], serves as a tourist attraction with trains dating back to the 19th century left to rust in the extensive [[salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] of the [[Salar de Uyuni]].&lt;ref name="Uyuni" /&gt; The site contains a train alleged to have been robbed by [[Butch Cassidy]] and the [[Sundance Kid]] and has been called "one of the most striking and haunting sights in the deserts of southwest Bolivia".&lt;ref name="Teleg10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Expe" /&gt;

The '''CFR Class TEA''' was a small series of [[Electric Multiple Units]] manufactured from 1974 to 1986 by [[Electroputere]] (electric equipment) and Întreprinderea de Vagoane Arad (railway cars) with the help of the Technological Institute of Research and Designing of Transports in [[Bucharest]]. Due to its rarity, not much is known about this trainset.

In the mid 1970s, the [[Romanian Railways]] was looking for an EMU train design that would replace conventional engine-towed local train consists, and also to work for a possible project that would envisage a regional railway network around Bucharest. The project took shape around 1972-1973, being built in 1974. The prototype was derived from the regional passenger cars named "Bonzana" among the travelers, that were made by the IVA factory. The whole trainset was fitted with Minden-Deutz bogies, especially the motor bogies, and the electric equipment was made together by Škoda and Electroputere and it used thyristors. It featured a destination board, open-able from the cab, where a cardboard plaque would be placed showing the route of the train, toilets and curtains. During 10 years of testing the train was heavily modified, mostly of electrical nature. The prototype was rarely used on Bucharest to Brașov duties, but also on [[Bucharest]] to [[Craiova]] or to Călărași trains too. It was withdrawn in the late 1990s. In the old CFR classification it was given the numbers 080-TEA-001/002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scontent.fotp3-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/535026_1286847521341399_6408283076130268535_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&amp;oh=66b408aed5f7f0f1818ddeebec46c64d&amp;oe=5BD01361|format=JPG|title=Photographic image|website=Scontent.fotp3-2.fna.fbcdn.net|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Series production started in 1984 but only eight of such multiple units were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railnet.ro/download/file.php?id=149|format=JPG|title=Photographic image|website=Railnet.ro|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were mostly used by the Cluj regional division for services between Cluj and Teiuș or Dej, but also by the Craiova regional division for trains between Craiova and Motru or Târgu Jiu and by the Bucharest regional division for trains to Călărași. In the new classification they were referred to as the following:

*55 00xx, motor driving car, second class, without pantograph
*56 00xx, motor cabless car, second class, with pantograph
*57 00xx, trailer car, first class, without pantograph
*57 00xx, trailer car, second class, without pantograph
*56 00xx, motor cabless car, second class, with pantograph
*55 00xx, motor driving car, second class, without pantograph

Whilst officially they were known as the RES 1870&amp;nbsp;kW by the [[Electroputere]], where RES stood for "Suburban Electric Multiple Unit" (Ramă Electrică Suburbană).

Another prototype was realized in 1991, which had stronger traction motors of 2870&amp;nbsp;kW overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/128377519@N08/16463606020|title=Rama Electrica Suburbana|website=Flickr.com|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But all these units were plagued with brake and electrical equipment issues, so after the 1990s they were quickly retired, in favour of [[CFR Class EA]]-pulled local trains. Nowadays the only remaining example is the 1991 prototype, although a few cars of the series production trainsets were known to have survived years ago.

[[File:A. Provost - Versailles - Railroad Disaster.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Versailles rail accident|1842 Versailles&amp;mdash;Bellevue line disaster]]. News about events like this one contributed to train anxiety]]
The '''fear of trains''' is [[anxiety]] and [[fear]] associated with [[train]]s, [[railway]]s, and railway travel.

==Psychoanalysis==
[[Psychonalyst]]s, starting from Freud himself, associated sensations towards travel by train with sexuality. In 1906 Freud wrote that the link of railway travel and sexuality derives from the pleasurable sensation of shaking during the travel. Therefore, in the event of [[repression (psychology)|repression]] of sexuality the person will experience anxiety when confronted with railway travel.&lt;ref name=Stekel&gt;Wilhelm Stekel, ''Nervöse Angstzustände und ihre Behandlung''; citing Freud in German, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4_U-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA191 pp. 191-198]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wschi&gt;Wolfgang Schivelbusch, ''The Railway Journey: The Industrialization of Time and Space in the 19th Century'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=890nCC_kZeIC&amp;pg=PA78 p. 78], citing Sigmund Freud as translated in English, "The Complete Psychological Work"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Abraham]]  interpreted the fear of the uncontrollable motion of a train as a projection of the fear of uncontrolled sexuality.&lt;ref name=wschi/&gt; [[Wilhelm Stekel]] (1908) also associated train phobia with rocking sensation, but in addition to [[libido]] repression, he associated it with the embarrassment with the reminiscences of the rocking sensation of the early childhood.&lt;ref name=Stekel/&gt;

==Other considerations==
Freud himself was suffering a kind of train anxiety, as he confessed in a number of letters.&lt;ref name=bmc&gt;Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic, Volumes 16-18, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8JgsAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Reiseangst+freud&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Reiseangst p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt; He used the term ''"Reiseangst"'' for it, which literally means "fear of travel" but it was recognized it was primarily associated with the travel by train,&lt;ref name=vitz&gt;Paul C. Vitz, ''Sigmund Freud's Christian Unconscious'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=mO4XVlWV8fcC&amp;pg=PA25 . 25]&lt;/ref&gt; and some translators translated Freud's ''"Reiseangst"'' as  "railroad phobia"&lt;ref name=bmc/&gt; However Freud's anxiety was not a "true" phobia, since one the travel started, the anxiety disappeared, and in fact Freud traveled much and liked it.&lt;ref name=vitz/&gt;

Regardless of sexuality, since early days various authors associated the uncontrollable motion of the train with the fear of [[derailment]], of a catastrophe.&lt;ref name=wschi/&gt;

Another source of fear in the early days of railway travel was travellers' isolation from the outside world, as well as the confinement in a small compartment, rendering a person who became sick or subject to crime, helpless. ''"...The loudest screams are swallowed up by the roar of the rapidly revolving wheels..."''.&lt;ref&gt;As cited by W. Schivelbusch, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of fear, as well as actual crimes committed in trains, were often a matter of newspaper publications of the times.&lt;ref&gt;W. Schivelbusch, pp. 79-83&lt;/ref&gt; After a number of prominent cases this fear was elevated to the level of collective [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Schivelbusch, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Public fear about rail travel  was heightened after British surgeon [[John Eric Erichsen]] described a [[post-traumatic (disambiguation)|post-traumatic]] diagnosis known as [[railway spine]] or "Erichsen's disease". People diagnosed with this had no obvious injury and were rejected as fake. Nowadays it is known that traffic accidents may cause [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Keller T., Chappell T., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8817791 "The rise and fall of Erichsen's disease (railroad spine)"] {{PMID|8817791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names and etymology==
It has been variously called as "train phobia", "railroad phobia", "dread of railway travel", etc. The German term "Eisenbahnangst" used, e.g., by [[Sigmund Freud]]&lt;ref name=Stekel/&gt; was literally converted into Greek as "siderodromophobia" (Eisen = sideron = iron, Bahn = dromos = way, Angst = phobos = fear).&lt;ref&gt;Otto Dornblüth, [http://www.textlog.de/31744.html Klinisches Wörterbuch.] 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; In cases when this anxiety exceeds the social norms of a realistic fear, this anxiety may be classified as a [[specific phobia]] about trains.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron T. Beck, Gary Emery, Ruth L.

The '''''Maritime Express''''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[passenger train]]. When it was launched on the first of March, 1898, it was the [[flagship]] of the [[Intercolonial Railway]] (ICR) between [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. The train was operated by the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR) from 1919 until 1964, when it was reduced to a regional service and its name retired. 

== Construction of the Intercolonial Railway ==
The call for a railway to link Canada’s [[Maritime Provinces]] with the colonies of [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] (after 1840, the [[Province of Canada]]), gained momentum by the mid-1830s. In 1835, editor [[Joseph Howe]], a future Nova Scotia premier, wrote in the ''[[Novascotian]]'' that railway construction would greatly enhance trade within the province.&lt;ref&gt;Seton, L.A. (1958, March). The Intercolonial Railway: Part one – Genesis of the project. ''Canadian Railway Historical Association News Report, 87'', 31-38. Retrieved from https://www.exporail.org/can_rail/Canadian%20Rail_no087_1958.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 1846, the [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]], [[Colin Campbell (British Army officer, born 1776)|Sir Colin Campbell]], wrote to [[William Gladstone]], Britain’s Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs, calling for a survey of a route for a rail connection linking Halifax with Montreal. In June of that year, Captain John Pipon and Lieutenant E. Wallcott Henderson of the Royal Corps of Engineers were ordered to conduct a survey to identify the optimal route. Pipon would die in the attempt, drowned in New Brunswick’s [[Restigouche River]] in November, 1846, to be replaced by Major William Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, J. (2005). ''Built for war: Canada’s Intercolonial Railway.'' Pickering ON: Railfare&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Robinson’s 1849 report to the legislatures of Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia that would largely define the route of the interprovincial railway. He identified four advantages of a rail line that would traverse northern New Brunswick, close to the shores of the [[Bay of Chaleur]]: opening the region to settlement, reduced elevations, lower cost and the military advantage of distance from the [[United States]] border.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, ''Ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of what was to become to become the Intercolonial’s main line began in the mid-1850s, with the first trains operating on the [[Nova Scotia Railway]] between Halifax and Truro in 1858.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=J. Boyko|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/intercolonial-railway|title=Intercolonial Railway|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=September 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, the British and colonial governments appointed the engineer [[Sandford Fleming]] to survey possible routes&lt;ref&gt;Creet, M. (2003).Fleming, Sir Sandford. In ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 14''. University of Toronto/Université Laval. Retrieved from [www.biographi.ca/en/bio/fleming_sandford_14E.html Fleming]&lt;/ref&gt;; by 1867 he declared his support for the northern route advocated by Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, J. (2005). ''Built for war: Canada’s Intercolonial Railway''. Pickering ON: Railfare-DC Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction to complete the link between the Maritimes and Quebec would wait until after Confederation in 1867. (Indeed, construction of the railway was to be a condition of the union, enshrined in the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, J. J. (2015): [https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/railway-history Railway history], at The Canadian Encyclopedia, accessed September 3, 2019. dated March 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Passenger service on the Intercolonial Railway ==
There was no formal “last spike” commemoration when the last section of the ICR’s line between Quebec and Halifax was completed on 1 July, 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Intercolonial Railway-1876 (2001). ''Canadian Rail'' (483), pp. 111-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Work had been completed in sections, with passenger and freight service offered as important communities were linked. Construction crews completed the difficult task of traversing Nova Scotia’s [[Cobequid Mountains]] in 1872&lt;ref&gt;Underwood., J. (2010). ''A line through the hills: How the Intercolonial Railway crossed Nova Scotia’s Cobequid Mountains''. Halifax: Pennydreadful.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first passenger train from Halifax reached [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] on 11 November that year. (Although, not without incident, the train having been delayed three hours by a derailed ballast train.)&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.N.W. (2004). ''The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute''. Ottawa: Trackside Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the first trains ran between [[Mont-Joli]], Quebec and [[Campbellton, New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

The first through passenger trains to link Montreal and Halifax departed on 3 July 1876, using Intercolonial tracks between Halifax and [[Rivière-du-Loup]], Quebec, and tracks of the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR) to Montreal. The trains took almost a day and a half to reach their destinations. The westbound train, called the ''Quebec Express'', was scheduled to leave Halifax at 7:10 p.m., arriving in Montreal two days later at 6:30 a.m.; the eastbound ''Saint John &amp; Halifax Express'' left Montreal at 10:00 p.m., arriving in Halifax at 8:25 a.m. The trains carried [[Pullman Company]] first class cars, the first [[sleeping car|sleeping cars]] to operate in eastern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.N.W. (2004). ''The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute''. Ottawa: Trackside Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

(Pullman’s presence in Atlantic Canada was short-lived. Demand for sleeping car space fell short of projections, averaging six beds per trip over the first two years. ICR ended its Pullman contract, taking over sleeping car operations, in 1885.)&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.N.W. (2004). ''The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute''. Ottawa: Trackside Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

The schedules’ 36-hour running time required coach passengers to change trains at [[Point Levi, Quebec]]; sleeping cars were added to connecting regional trains. The trains originated and terminated at GTR’s [[Bonaventure Station (1887–1952)|Bonaventure Station]] in Montreal and [[North Street Station (Halifax)|North Street Station]] in Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;Starting in August, 1877. Before that, Halifax trains stopped at the station built in 1854 by the [[Nova Scotia Railway]] at [[Richmond, Nova Scotia|Richmond]]. Smith, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inauguration of the ''Maritime Express'' ==
By the dawn of the 1890s, the ICR recognized the need for improved service on its Halifax-Montreal route.  Beginning in 1889, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) had become a direct competitor, operating its ''Eastern Express'' and ''Western Express'' trains out of Montreal’s [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor Station]] via [[Sherbrooke]], Quebec and Saint John to Halifax. Most vexing for ICR managers, the federal government had granted running rights to the CPR over ICR rails from Saint John to Halifax. By virtue of its shorter route, the CPR was able to complete the trip in three hours less than the Intercolonial trains. ICR responded by petitioning the government to extend its own tracks to Montreal through the purchase of a regional Quebec line, eliminating the need to change trains in Point-Levi. The railway also secured permission to purchase more powerful locomotives and new modern cars.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March, 1898, the Intercolonial launched a faster schedule, rebranding its flagship trains as the ''Maritime Express''. The eastbound train left Montreal at 7:30 p.m., arriving in Halifax the next day at 9:40 p.m.; westbound, the train departed Halifax at 1:30 p.m. and pulled into Bonaventure station the following day at 5:35 p.m. The trains featured first-class [[dining car|dining cars]] and sleepers built by the [[Wagner Palace Car Company]]. The sleepers featured 10 open sections and two drawing rooms, “finished in polished mahogany beautifully inlaid with lighter woods [with] ceilings of green and gold, in the Empire style, and the upholstering…of a rich green plush.”&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, the ICR revised the schedule of the eastbound ''Maritime Express'' to depart Montreal at 11:30 a.m., arriving in Halifax a day later at 3:30 p.m. This allowed for an early evening arrival at Point-Levi, providing a more convenient ferry connection for passengers crossing the [[St. Lawrence River ]] to [[Quebec City]].  On the whole, the train proved to be popular with travellers, with a 45% increase in sleeping car revenues and a 260% jump in dining car revenues in its first year of operation. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion ==
[[File:Postcard_image_of_train_"Maritime_Express",_circa_1903.jpg|thumbnail|left|320px|Postcard image of the ''Maritime Express'' in the Wentworth Valley, circa 1903.]]
Between 1900 and the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, ICR invested heavily in improvements to its rolling stock, motive power and infrastructure. It ordered new passenger cars, installed upgraded tracks and bridges to carry heavier trains, and constructed impressive new stations in communities along the line. In 1912 the railway undertook a massive project to construct a new terminus in the south end of Halifax, connecting it to the main line by blasting through miles of solid bedrock. The project would prove to be prescient when North Street Station and much of the railway’s waterfront infrastructure was wrecked by the [[Halifax Explosion]] in 1917. The ''Maritime Express'' moved to a new “temporary” south end station on 22 December, 1918 and to the new [[Halifax station (Nova Scotia)|Halifax Station]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, J. (2005). ''Built for war: Canada’s Intercolonial Railway.'' Pickering ON: Railfare&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Maritime Express'' continued to build patronage through its first 12 years. Heavy traffic often required the addition of a second following section; in 1906 Christmas travel volumes forced the addition of a third section on part of the route. In 1904, the railway began to replace its older, lighter engines, mostly [[4-6-0]] “Ten-wheeler” types, with faster and more powerful [[4-6-2]] “Pacifics” built by [[Canadian Locomotive Company|Kingston Locomotive Works]] and [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] (MLW).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.N.W. (2004). ''The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute''. Ottawa: Trackside Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;  Travellers were enchanted by the bucolic Maritime scenery as the train skirted the Bay of Chaleur, crossed the [[Tantramar Marshes]] between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia  and crested the Cobequid Mountains.  Journalist (and future Nova Scotia [[List of premiers of Nova Scotia|premier]]) [[William Stevens Fielding]] wrote in 1872 that the view of Nova Scotia’s [[Wentworth Valley]] from the train was “a scene of grandeur and beauty unequalled by any other. (…) It seemed as though the mountain were a monarch clothed in the loveliest raiment, sitting there to protect the smiling and fruitful valley. No wonder the ladies ceased their gossip, the card players threw aside their cards, and singers forgot their songs. All gazed with admiration on the beautiful scene spread out before them."&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, J. (n.d.). A train runs through it. ''Saltscapes''. Retrieved from http://www.saltscapes.com/roots-folks/628-a-train-runs-through-it.html &lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the ''Maritime Express'' led in 1904 to the introduction of a second Montreal-Halifax train on the route. ICR inaugurated the ''[[Ocean (train)|Ocean Limited]]'' on 3 July, 1904, calling it “the finest passenger service…it has ever had.” &lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.N.W. (2004). ''The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute''. Ottawa: Trackside Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; Begun as a seasonal summer service, it was expanded to a year-round operation in 1912, becoming a full running mate to the ''Maritime Express''.  Like other trains bestowed with the name “Limited”, the ''Ocean Limited'' made fewer stops than the older train.  Its popularity was such that the ''Maritime Express'' had added so many stops along its route that “the name ‘Express’ began to lose all meaning.”&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, J. (2004). The creation of a legend. ''Canadian Rail'' (500), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1909, the journey of the ''Maritime Express'' from Montreal to Halifax took 28 hours and 15 minutes, compared to 24 hours and 35 minutes for the ''Ocean Limited''. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.N.W. (2004). ''The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute''. Ottawa: Trackside Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Maritime Express'' operated on a six-day per week schedule for much of its history, originally eschewing Sunday departures in deference to Maritime sensibilities about travel on the Sabbath. In Quebec, where attitudes were apparently more liberal, the train operated daily between Montreal and Mont Joli for many years. With the inauguration of daily service on a year-round ''Ocean'', the ''Maritime Express'' would maintain a Monday-Saturday schedule. Traffic volumes continued to grow on both trains to the extent that a third daily-except-Sunday train was added to the schedule in 1927, the all-sleeping car ''Acadian''; however, the train was short-lived, an early casualty of the [[Great Depression]] in late 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The train on the bill==
In 1912, the Dominion of Canada issued its first five dollar banknote, featuring an engraving of a steam-powered passenger train.  The image on the face of the bill is of the ''Maritime Express'' traversing Nova Scotia’s Wentworth Valley.  The picture closely follows an original publicity photo, shot by an unknown photographer for the ICR, circa 1903. Some later sources identify the train pictured as the ''Ocean Limited''&lt;ref&gt;Canada Currency (n.d.). Dominion of Canada May 1st 1912 Five Dollar Bill. Retrieved from: http://canadacurrency.com/dominion-of-canada/five-dollar-bank-notes-dominion-of-canada/value-of-may-1st-1912-5-bill-from-the-dominion-of-canada-2/&lt;/ref&gt;; however, historians Jay Underwood and Douglas Smith both confirm the image is of the ''Maritime Express''. Among other evidence, the same image appears on postcards produced in the first decade of the century that clearly identify the train as the ''Maritime Express''. The locomotive in the photograph is a smaller 4-6-0 type that had been largely replaced by bigger motive power at the time the ''Ocean Limited'' was introduced. Over 11 million of the banknotes were produced and they remained in circulation until the early 1930s. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.N.W. (2004). ''The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute''. Ottawa: Trackside Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, J. (2010). History follows the Ocean to the ocean. ''Canadian Rail'' (536), pp. 95-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
In 1915, as World War I deepened, the federal government moved to consolidate its railway holdings, including the ICR and the Moncton-Winnipeg [[National Transcontinental Railway]], under the umbrella of the [[Canadian Government Railways]] (CGR). Despite this, the ICR continued to largely maintain its own brand, including the use of its “IRC” reporting marks and its slogan, “The People’s Railway”. The ongoing financial crisis began to impact other struggling lines and in 1918 the government created [[Canadian National Railways]] to take over operations of the CGR and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], followed by the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] and its parent, the Grand Trunk.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, J. (2005). ''Built for war: Canada’s Intercolonial Railway.'' Pickering ON: Railfare&lt;/ref&gt; CNR continued to operate the ''Maritime Express'' and the ''Ocean Limited'', outfitting the trains with new power in the form of [[4-8-2]] Mountain-type locomotives and, later, powerful [[4-8-4]] “Northerns”. During the depths of the Depression, the ''Ocean Limited'' lost much of its lustre, becoming as much of a plodding local as its older running mate. Consideration was given briefly to discontinuing the ''Maritime Express'' during the economic downturn but the option was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.N.W. (2004). ''The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute''. Ottawa: Trackside Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War II]], traffic on CNR’s lines to the Atlantic coast soared, resulting in massive improvements to infrastructure and an expansion of passenger service. The trains frequently operated in multiple sections and in 1941 the railway introduced a third daily train, the ''Scotian'', and converted the ''Ocean'' to a sleeping-car only train. Wartime traffic continued to stretch capacity to the limit, resulting in the replacement of full dining cars on the ''Maritime Express'' with café cars in 1942. The running time for the ''Maritime Express'' was extended to almost 31 hours in 1943. That year, the train moved to the long-awaited new [[Montreal Central Station]]. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of World War II and the decline in military traffic, ridership on the ''Maritime Express'' and its two running mates began to erode. Revenue losses grew, although there were a few bright spots: the ''Maritime Express'' continued to show a profit on its Campbellton-Riviere-du-Loup route segment in 1949. The loss of passengers was compounded by the introduction of the first rudimentary interprovincial bus service and expanded air service by [[Trans-Canada Air Lines]]. In an effort to arrest the trend, in 1952-53 CNR ordered 359 new passenger cars to replace war-weary rolling stock, including sleepers with more private rooms. In March, 1950, diesel power appeared on the ''Maritime Express'' for the first time in the form of a three-unit [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors]] [[EMD FP7]] demonstrator; however, the ''Maritime Express'' was the last of the three trains to fully convert to diesel power in 1958, mostly in favour of [[MLW FPA-2]] models.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maritime_Express,_east_of_Montreal,_c_1958.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The ''Maritime Express'', carrying mostly mail and express cars, east of Montreal, circa 1958.]]

==Discontinuance==
In 1955, the ''Maritime Express'' lost its status as the railroad’s premiere train, giving up the numbers 1 and 2 to the ''Ocean Limited'', which it shared with the newly-inaugurated [[Vancouver]]-[[Toronto]]/Montreal ''[[Super Continental]]''.  Following the recommendations of a parliamentary committee established to examine the future of Maritime passenger services, the schedule of the ''Maritime Express'' was reduced in 1957 to less than 26 hours eastbound and just over 23 hours westbound, improving connections with the Yarmouth-Halifax train to boost express fish shipments. The new schedule had the train leaving Halifax at 3:10 p.m., changed from 7:45 p.m. Despite the changes, ridership on the train continued to decline, resulting in the removal of sleeping, cafeteria and parlour cars from its consist over parts of the route.  On 28 October, 1961, the ''Maritime Express'' was cut back to Moncton, no longer travelling between the New Brunswick city and Halifax. The schedule also added a layover of more than five hours in Campbellton. For most of the year, the train carried mostly mail and express cars along with a few coaches.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts by CNR to boost ridership with its innovative “red, white and blue” fare structure and other improvements in the early 1960s failed to produce positive results for the ''Maritime Express'' and on 27 October, 1963, the train became a daylight-only train between Montreal and Campbellton. Less than six months later, on 26 April, CNR removed the ''Maritime Express'' name from the train.&lt;ref&gt;A nameless train carrying the ''Maritime Express’'' final numbers – 3 and 4 – would continue to run between Montreal and Campbellton until 1966. Smith, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents==
* The ''Maritime Express'' operated without a major accident from its inception in 1898 until 5 October, 1909, when the engineer and express handler died after their train collided with a freight train near Campbellton, New Brunswick. The engineer of the freight train was also killed. An inquest blamed improper timekeeping for the freight train’s failure to clear the line in time.
* On 10 July, 1912, the train derailed at [[Shubenacadie Grand Lake|Grand Lake]], 23 miles from its destination in Halifax. The engineer and fireman died when their locomotive rolled down an embankment into the lake.  A kinked rail was blamed for the mishap, which also killed a [[hobo]] riding in a baggage car. 
* The ''Ocean Limited'' was in the siding at [[Thomson Station, Nova Scotia]], on 31 March, 1927, when the ''Maritime Express'', travelling at speed on the main line, went through an open switch and collided with the train. The ''Ocean’s'' fireman was killed in the crash.
* The last major incident involving the train occurred on 6 July, 1943, at the height of heavy World War II traffic. The westbound ''Maritime Express'', with 15 cars, collided with a 42-car freight train on the bridge spanning the Montmagny River in Quebec. The investigation found that the passenger train’s engineer had seen the approaching freight in time to nearly stop his train, but the engineer of the freight train inexplicably applied his brakes only moments before impact. He died in the wreck. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ETunnelhoch.jpg|thumb|Interior of a [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]] train.]]

A '''car shuttle train''', or (sometimes) '''car-carrying train''', is a [[shuttle train]] used to transport accompanied [[car]]s ([[automobile]]s), and usually also other types of road vehicles, for a relatively short distance.

Car shuttle trains usually operate on lines passing through a [[rail tunnel]] and connecting two places not easily accessible to each other by road.  On car shuttle train services, the occupants of the road vehicles being carried on the train usually stay with their vehicle throughout the rail journey.

As such, car shuttle train services are to be contrasted with [[Auto Train]] or [[Motorail]] services.  Unlike a car shuttle train, an Auto Train or Motorail train is a [[passenger train]] on which, except in France,&lt;ref&gt;In France, Motorail passengers and their vehicles are transported on two separate trains.&lt;/ref&gt; passengers can take their car or automobile along with them. On Auto Trains or Motorail trains, passengers are carried in normal [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]]s or in [[sleeping car]]s on longer journeys, while the cars or automobiles are loaded separately into [[autorack]]s, car carriers, or [[flatcar]]s that normally form part of the same train.

The '''''Zephyr Rocket''''' was an overnight passenger train operated jointly by the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] ("Burlington Route") and the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]] ("Rock Island Lines") between [[Saint Louis, Missouri]] and the [[Twin Cities]] of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] and [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], with major intermediate stops in [[Burlington, Iowa|Burlington]], [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa|Cedar Rapids]], and [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy carried the train between St. Louis and Burlington, while the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific carried it between Burlington and Minneapolis/St. Paul.  Motive power and equipment were pooled and traveled the entire distance without change.

The trains, with coaches and sleeping cars, started operating on January 7, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208074112/http://www.rits.org/www/equipment/rizeph.html|title=Zephyr Rocket Consists|publisher=Rock Island Technical Society|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They also carried round-end observation cars with the train's name emblazoned on the rear for several years.

The train was named by combining the nicknames of the operating railroads' passenger train fleets:  The passenger trains of the Burlington Route were called &lt;i&gt;Zephyrs&lt;/i&gt;, while those of the Rock Island Lines were called &lt;i&gt;Rockets&lt;/i&gt;, hence &lt;i&gt;Zephyr Rocket&lt;/i&gt;.  

In 1964 the train was still earning money above its direct costs, at least for the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy.&lt;ref&gt; Frailey, Fred W.(1998). ''Twilight of the Great Trains'', p. 108.  Waukesha, Wisconsin:  Kalmbach Publishing.  {{ISBN|0 89024 178 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967 the train, by then coaches-only, was discontinued, with the last trains departing on April 8 and arriving at their respective end points the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;Frailey, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, it would not be possible to re-institute direct passenger rail service between the Twin Cities and St. Louis today, as a key part of the route, between Burlington and Cedar Rapids, was abandoned when the Rock Island ceased operations in 1980.  Portions of this section have been converted to bicycle/hiking trails.

{{train topics}}

A '''train''' is a form of [[rail transport]] consisting of a series of connected [[Railroad car|vehicles]] that generally run along a [[Track (rail transport)|railroad (or railway) track]] to transport passengers or cargo (also known as "freight" or "goods"). The word "train" comes from the [[Old French]] ''trahiner'', derived from the [[Latin]] ''trahere'' meaning "to pull" or "to draw".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Train (noun) |work=(definition – Compact OED) |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/train?view=uk |accessdate=18 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050526072449/http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/train?view=uk |archivedate=26 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motive power for a train is provided by a separate [[locomotive]] or individual motors in a self-propelled [[multiple unit]]. The term "engine" is often used as an alternative to locomotive. Although historically [[steam locomotive|steam]] propulsion dominated, the most common types of locomotive are [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[Electric locomotive|electric]], the latter supplied by [[Overhead lines|overhead wires]] or [[Third rail|additional rails]]. Trains can also be [[Horsecar|hauled by horses]], pulled by [[Cable railway|engine or water-driven cable or wire winch]], run downhill using gravity, or powered by [[pneumatics]], [[gas turbine]]s or [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].

The track usually consists of two running [[Rail profile|rails]] with a [[Track gauge|fixed spacing]], which may be supplemented by additional rails such as [[Third rail|electric conducting rails]] and [[Rack railway|rack rails]]. [[Monorail]]s and [[maglev]] guideways are also used occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magnetic Levitation Trains |url=http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/mpa/stc/train.shtml |website=Los Alamos National Laboratory |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |accessdate=17 September 2014 |quote=The electrodynamic suspension (EDS) levitates the train by repulsive forces from the induced currents in the conductive guideways. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208130319/http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/mpa/stc/train.shtml |archivedate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[passenger train]] includes passenger-carrying vehicles and can often be very long and fast.  [[High-speed rail]] service began expanding rapidly in the late 20th century, and is also a major subject of further development.  The term "[[light rail]]" is sometimes used to refer to a modern [[tram]] system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a [[rapid transit|heavy rail rapid transit system]].  

A [[freight train]] (or goods train) uses [[Railroad car#Freight cars|freight cars]] (or wagons/trucks) to transport goods or materials (cargo). It is possible to carry passengers and freight in the same train using a ''mixed consist''.

Rail cars and machinery that are used for the maintenance and repair of tracks, are termed "[[maintenance of way]]" equipment; these may be assembled into maintenance of way trains. Similarly, dedicated trains may be used to provide support services to stations along a train line, such as garbage or revenue collection.

== Types ==
[[File:Claude Monet - Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare]]'', by [[Claude Monet]], 1877, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes. A train can consist of a combination of one or more [[locomotive]]s and attached [[railroad car]]s, or a self-propelled [[multiple unit]], or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach called a [[railcar]]. Special kinds of train running on corresponding purpose-built "railways" are [[monorail]]s, [[high-speed rail]]ways, [[maglev]], [[atmospheric railway]]s, [[Rubber-tyred metro|rubber-tired underground]], [[funicular]] and [[Rack railway|cog railways]].

A passenger train consists of one or more locomotives and (usually) several coaches. Alternatively, a train may consist entirely of passenger-carrying coaches, some or all of which are powered; this is known as a "multiple unit". In many parts of the world, particularly the Far East and Europe, high-speed rail is used extensively for passenger travel. Freight trains consist of cars, wagons or trucks rather than carriages, though some parcel and mail trains (especially [[Travelling Post Office]]s) appear outwardly to be more like passenger trains. Trains can also have ''mixed consist'', with both passenger accommodation and freight vehicles. These mixed trains are most likely to be used for services that run infrequently, where the provision of separate passenger and freight trains would not be cost-effective, but the disparate needs of passengers and freight means that this is avoided where possible. Special trains are also used for [[Rail tracks#Maintenance|track maintenance]]; in some places, this is called "maintenance of way".

In the United Kingdom, a train hauled using two locomotives is known as a "double-headed" train. In Canada and the United States, it is quite common for a long freight train to be headed by three or more locomotives. A train with a locomotive attached at both ends is described as "top and tailed", this practice typically being used when there are no reversing facilities available. Where a second locomotive is attached temporarily to assist a train when ascending steep banks or gradients (or to provide braking power for a descent), this is referred to as "[[bank engine|banking]]" in the UK. Many loaded trains in the US are assembled using one or more locomotives in the middle or at the rear of the train, which are then operated remotely from the lead cab. This is referred to as "DP" or "Distributed Power."

=== Terminology ===
The [[railway terminology]] that is used to describe a train varies between countries.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, the interchangeable terms ''set'' and ''unit'' are used to refer to a group of permanently or semi-permanently coupled vehicles, such as those of a multiple unit. While when referring to a train made up of a variety of vehicles, or of several sets/units, the term ''formation'' is used. (Although the UK public and media often forgo ''formation'', for simply ''train''.) The word ''rake'' is also used for a group of coaches or wagons.

Section 83(1) of the UK's [[Railways Act 1993]] defines "train" as follows:
:a) two or more items of rolling stock coupled together, at least one of which is a locomotive; or
:b) a locomotive not coupled to any other rolling stock.

====Other countries====
The [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]'s 1948 operating rules define a train as: "An engine or more than one engine coupled, with or without cars, displaying markers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway |title=Rules: Operating Department |year=1948 |pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, Australia and other countries, the term ''consist'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|s|ɪ|s|t}} {{respell|KON|sist}}) is used to describe the group of rail vehicles that make up a train. When specifically referring to [[Power (physics)|motive power]], the term refers to the group of [[locomotive]]s powering the train, as does ''lash-up''. The term ''trainset'' refers to a group of [[rolling stock]] that is permanently or semi-permanently coupled together to form a unified set of equipment (the term is most often applied to [[passenger train]] configurations).

== Bogies ==
[[File:Railroad truck, FM55-20.Fig8-8.png|thumb|US-style railroad truck (bogie) with [[journal bearing]]s]]
[[File:Train bogie under.jpg|thumb|View from under the bogie of a train]]
{{Main|Bogie}}
A '''bogie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|ɡ|i}} {{Respell|BOH|ghee}}) is a wheeled wagon or trolley. In [[Machine|mechanics]] terms, a bogie is a [[chassis]] or [[Underframe|framework]] carrying wheels, attached to a vehicle. It can be fixed in place, as on a cargo truck, mounted on a swivel, as on a railway carriage or locomotive, or sprung as in the suspension of a caterpillar [[tracked vehicle]]. Usually, two bogies are fitted to each carriage, wagon or locomotive, one at each end. An alternate configuration, which is often used in articulated vehicles, places the bogies (often [[Jacobs bogie]]s) under the connection between the carriages or wagons. Most bogies have two axles, as this is the simplest design, but some cars designed for extremely heavy loads have been built with up to five axles per bogie. Heavy-duty cars may have more than two bogies using [[span bolster]]s to equalize the load and connect the bogies to the cars. Usually, the train floor is at a level above the bogies, but the floor of the car may be lower between bogies, such as for a double decker train to increase interior space while staying within height restrictions, or in easy-access, stepless-entry, low-floor trains.

== Motive power ==
{{Main|Locomotive}}
[[Image:SwissMGB.jpg|thumbnail|Swiss Electric locomotive at [[Brig, Switzerland]]]]

The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses, but from the early 19th century almost all trains were powered by [[steam locomotive]]s. From the 1910s onwards, steam locomotives began to be replaced with less labor-intensive (and cleaner) diesel and electric locomotives, although these new forms of propulsion were far more complex and expensive than steam power. At about the same time, self-propelled multiple unit vehicles (both diesel and electric) became much more widely used in passenger service. [[Dieselisation]] of locomotives in day-to-day use was completed in most countries by the 1970s. Steam locomotives are still used in [[heritage railway]]s operated in many countries for the leisure and enthusiast market.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Electric traction offers a lower cost per mile of train operation but at a higher initial cost, which can only be justified on high traffic lines. Even though the cost per mile of construction is much higher, electric traction is more viable during operation because diesel import costs are substantially higher. Electric trains receive their current via [[overhead lines]] or through a [[Third rail|third rail electric system]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

A developing technology is [[fuel cell]]s, which combine the advantage of not needing an electrical system in place, with the advantage of emissionless operation. However, an impediment is substantial initial cost associated with [[fuel cell vehicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrogencarsnow.com/blog2/index.php/hydrogen-vehicles/i-hear-the-hydrogen-train-a-comin-its-rolling-round-the-bend/ |title=I Hear the Hydrogen Train a Comin', It's Rolling Round the Bend – Hydrogen Cars Now |author=Hydro Kevin Kantola |date=14 August 2006 |work=Hydrogen Cars Now |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302030328/http://www.hydrogencarsnow.com/blog2/index.php/hydrogen-vehicles/i-hear-the-hydrogen-train-a-comin-its-rolling-round-the-bend/ |archivedate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Passenger trains ==
[[File:InterCity2 - passenger car interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of a [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]] in a long-distance train in [[Finland]]]]
A passenger train includes passenger-carrying vehicles and can often be very long and fast. It may be a self-powered multiple unit or [[railcar]], or else a combination of one or more [[locomotive]]s and one or more unpowered trailers known as [[passenger car (rail)|coaches, cars or carriages]]. Passenger trains travel between [[train station|stations or depots]], where passengers may board and disembark. In most cases, passenger trains operate on a fixed [[Public transport timetable|schedule]] and have superior track occupancy rights over [[freight train]]s.

Unlike freight trains, passenger trains must supply [[head-end power]] to each coach for lighting and heating, among other purposes. This can be drawn directly from the locomotive's [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]] (modified for the purpose), or from a separate [[diesel generator]] in the locomotive. For passenger service on remote routes where a head-end-equipped locomotive may not always be available, a separate generator van may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Johnson |title=Head-end power |date=1 May 2006 |url=http://trn.trains.com/railroads/abcs-of-railroading/2006/05/head-end-power |work=ABCs of Railroading |accessdate=20 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219213623/http://trn.trains.com/railroads/abcs-of-railroading/2006/05/head-end-power |archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwrail.com/HEP_config.html |title=HEP Trainline Configurations in North America |publisher=Northwest Rail |accessdate=20 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722044938/http://www.nwrail.com/HEP_config.html |archivedate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oversight of a passenger train is the responsibility of the [[conductor (transportation)|conductor]]. He or she is sometimes assisted by other crew members, such as service attendants or [[porter (railroad)|porters]]. During the heyday of North American passenger rail travel, long-distance trains carried two conductors: the aforementioned train conductor, and a [[Pullman Company|Pullman conductor]], the latter being in charge of [[sleeping car]] personnel.

Many [[Luxury trains|prestigious passenger train services]] have been given a [[Lists of named passenger trains|specific name]], some of which have become famous in literature and fiction. In past years, railroaders often referred to passenger trains as the "varnish", alluding to the bygone days of wooden-bodied coaches with their lustrous exterior finishes and fancy [[livery]]. "Blocking the varnish" meant a slow-moving freight train was obstructing a fast passenger train, causing delays.

Some passenger trains, both long-distance and short-distance, may use [[Bilevel car|bi-level (double-decker)]] cars to carry more passengers per train. Car design and the general safety of passenger trains have dramatically evolved over time, making travel by rail remarkably safe.

=== Long-distance trains ===
Long-distance trains travel between many cities or regions of a country, and sometimes cross several countries. They often have a [[dining car]] or restaurant car to allow passengers to have a meal during the course of their journey. Trains travelling overnight may also have [[sleeping car]]s. Currently much of travel on these distances of over {{convert|500|miles}} is done by air in many countries but in others long-distance travel by rail is a popular or the only cheap way to travel long distances.

==== High-speed rail ====
[[File:JRC N700 series Z28.jpg|thumb|The [[N700 Series Shinkansen|Shinkansen N700 Series]] ''[[Nozomi (train)|Nozomi]]'' travels between [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]] in around two and a half hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen Timetable |url=https://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/info/timetable/_pdf/westbound_0314.pdf |website=[[JR Central]] |accessdate=2 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|High-speed rail}}One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail. Generally, high-speed rail runs at speeds above {{convert|200|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and often operates on dedicated track that is surveyed and prepared to accommodate high speeds. Japan's [[Shinkansen]] (popularly known as the "bullet train") commenced operation in 1964, and was the first successful example of a high-speed passenger rail system.

The fastest wheeled train running on rails is France's [[TGV]] (Train à Grande Vitesse, literally "high speed train"), which achieved a speed of {{convert|574.8|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}, twice the takeoff speed of a [[Boeing 727]] [[jet airliner|jetliner]], under test conditions in 2007. The highest speed currently attained in scheduled revenue operation is {{convert|350|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on}} on the [[Beijing–Tianjin Intercity Rail]] and [[Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]] systems in China. The TGV runs at a maximum revenue speed of {{convert|300|-|320|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, as does Germany's [[InterCityExpress|Inter-City Express]] and Spain's [[AVE]] (Alta Velocidad Española).

In most cases, high-speed rail travel is time- and cost-competitive with air travel when distances do not exceed {{convert|500|to|600|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}, as airport [[check-in]] and boarding procedures may add as many as two hours to the overall transit time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Central Japan Railway |title=Central Japan Railway Data Book 2006 |year=2006 |pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, rail operating costs over these distances may be lower when the amount of [[jet fuel|fuel]] consumed by an [[airliner]] during [[takeoff]] and [[Climb (aeronautics)|climbout]] is considered. As travel distance increases, the latter consideration becomes less of the total cost of operating an airliner and air travel becomes more cost-competitive.

Some high-speed rail equipment employs [[tilting train|tilting technology]] to improve stability in curves. Examples of such equipment are the [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT), the [[Pendolino]], the [[N700 Series Shinkansen]], [[Amtrak]]'s [[Acela Express]] and the [[Talgo]]. Tilting is a dynamic form of [[superelevation]], allowing both low- and high-speed traffic to use the same trackage (though not simultaneously), as well as producing a more comfortable ride for passengers.

==== Inter-city trains ====
[[File:City of Rockhampton train (Sunshine railway station, Brisbane).jpg|thumb|The [[Electric Tilt Train]], the fastest train in Australia, travelling between [[Brisbane]] and [[Rockhampton]] in [[Queensland]], a distance of 615km.]]
{{Main|Inter-city rail}}

"Inter-city" is a general term for any rail service that uses trains with limited stops to provide fast long-distance travel. Inter-city services can be divided into three major groups:

* [[InterCity]]: using high-speed trains to connect cities, bypassing all intermediate stations, thus linking major population hubs in the fastest time possible
* [[Express train|Express]]: calling at some intermediate stations between cities, serving larger [[Urban area|urban]] communities
* [[Regional rail|Regional]]: calling at all intermediate stations between cities, serving smaller communities along the route

The distinction between the three types of inter-city rail service may be unclear; trains can run as InterCity services between major cities, then revert to an express (or even regional) train service to reach communities at the [[wikt:extremity|extremity]] of the journey. This practice allows [[marginalization|marginal]] communities to be served in the most cost-effective way, at the expense of a longer journey time for those wishing to travel to the [[Train station#Terminus|terminus]] station.

==== Regional trains ====
{{Main|Regional rail}}

Regional trains usually connect between towns and cities, serving smaller urban (and some [[Rural area|rural]]) communities en route. These services are provided to meet local traffic demand in less accessible areas.

==== Higher-speed rail ====
{{Main|Higher-speed rail}}

Higher-speed rail is a special category of trains. The trains for higher-speed rail services can operate at top speeds that are higher than conventional inter-city trains but the speeds are not as high as those in the high-speed rail services. These services are provided after improvements to the conventional rail infrastructure to support trains that can operate safely at higher speeds.

=== Short-distance trains ===
==== Commuter trains ====
[[File:Mumbai Train.JPG|thumb|[[Mumbai Suburban Railway|Mumbai's suburban trains]] handle 7.24 million commuters daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrvc.indianrail.gov.in/overview.htm |work=Official webpage of Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation |title=Overview Of the existing Mumbai Suburban Railway |accessdate=11 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620033027/http://www.mrvc.indianrail.gov.in/overview.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main|Commuter rail|Commuter rail in North America}}
For shorter distances many cities have networks of [[commuter train]]s (also known as suburban trains) serving the city and its suburbs. Trains are a very efficient [[mode of transport]] to cope with large traffic demand in a [[metropolis]]. Compared with road transport, it carries many people with much smaller land area and little air pollution. Commuter rail also travels longer ranges compared to rapid transit systems with comparatively less frequency and may share tracks with other trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-metro-and-local-train|title=Difference between Metro and Local Train|last=Sangeeta|date=24 June 2013|website=www.differencebetween.info|access-date=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some carriages may be laid out to have more standing room than seats, or to facilitate the carrying of [[Baby transport#Pushable vehicles|prams]], [[bicycle|cycles]] or [[wheelchair]]s. Some countries have [[Bilevel car|double-decked passenger trains]] for use in conurbations. Double deck high speed and sleeper trains are becoming more common in mainland Europe.

Sometimes extreme congestion of commuter trains becomes a problem. For example, an estimated 3.5 million passengers ride every day on [[Yamanote Line]] in Tokyo, Japan, with its 29 stations. For comparison, the [[New York City Subway]] carries 5.7 million passengers per day on {{NYCS const|routes}} services serving {{NYCS const|number|total}} stations. To cope with large traffic, special cars in which the bench seats fold up to provide standing room only during the morning rush hour (until 10 a.m.) are operated in Tokyo ([[E231 series]] train). In the past this train has included 2 cars with six doors on each side to shorten the time for passengers to get on and off at station.

Passenger trains usually have [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] handles (or a "communication cord") that the public can operate. Misuse is punished by a heavy fine.

Various commuter and suburban train operators (e.g. [[Sydney Trains]], [[NJ Transit Rail Operations|NJ Transit]], [[Réseau Express Régional|Paris RER]]) use [[Bilevel rail car|double-decker trains]]. Double-decker trains offer increased capacity even when running less services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-11/barry-ofarrell-sydney-trains-claim-doubtful/5371446|title=Single-decker v double-decker trains: Barry O'Farrell's claim doubtful|date=11 April 2014|work=ABC News|access-date=29 March 2018|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Within cities ===
==== Rapid transit ====
[[File:Lancaster Gate tube.jpg|thumbnail|right|A "tube train" on the London Underground]]
{{Main|Rapid transit}}
Large cities often have a rapid transit system, also called "metro", "underground", "subway" or "tube". The trains are electrically powered, usually by [[third rail]], and their railroads are separate from other traffic, usually without [[level crossing]]s. Usually they run in tunnels in the city center and sometimes on elevated structures in the outer parts of the city. They can accelerate and decelerate faster than heavier, long-distance trains.

The general term "rapid transit" is used for public transport such as commuter trains, metro and light rail. However, services on the [[New York City Subway]] have been referred to as "trains", while services on the [[London Underground]] are commonly referred to as "tube trains" or "tubes".

==== Tram ====
{{Main|Tram}}
[[File:Karlikwbytomiu.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Alstom Citadis]] 100 articulated tram in [[Bytom]], [[Poland]]]]

In the UK, the distinction between a tramway and a railway is precise and defined in law. In Canada and the US, such street railways are referred to as [[tram|trolleys]] or [[streetcar]]s. The key physical difference between a railroad and a trolley system is that the latter runs primarily on public streets, whereas trains have a [[Right of way (transportation)|right-of-way]] separated from the public streets. Often the US-style [[interurban]] and modern [[light rail]] are confused with a trolley system, as it too may run on the street for short or medium-length sections. In some languages, the word ''tram'' also refers to interurban and light rail-style networks, in particular Dutch.

The length of a tram or trolley may be determined by national regulations. Germany has the so-called Bo-Strab standard, restricting the length of a tram to 75 meters, while in the US, vehicle length is normally restricted by local authorities, often allowing only a single type of vehicle to operate on the network.

==== Light rail ====
{{main|Light rail}}

The term "light rail" is sometimes used for a modern tram system, despite light rail lines commonly having a mostly exclusive right-of-way, more similar to that of a heavy-rail line and less like that of a tramway. It may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a [[Rapid transit|subway]], except that it may have level crossings which are then usually protected with crossing gates. In US terminology, these systems are often referred to as "inter-urban" because they connect larger urban areas in the vicinity of a major city to the center of the city. Modern light rail systems often use abandoned heavy rail rights-of-way (e.g. former railway lines) to revitalize deprived areas and [[redevelopment]] sites in and around large [[Urban area|agglomerations]].

==== Monorail ====
[[File:Mono-shibaura.jpg|thumb|[[Tokyo Monorail]]]]
{{Main|Monorail}}

Monorails were developed to meet medium-demand traffic in urban transit, and consist of a train running on a single rail, typically elevated. Monorails represent a relatively small part of the overall railway field. Almost all monorail trains use linear induction motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitachi-rail.com/products/rolling_stock/linear/index.html |title=Linear Motor Driven System |year=2013 |website=Hitachi-Rail.com |publisher=[[Hitachi|Hitachi, Ltd.]] |access-date=23 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railsystem.net/monorail/ |title=Monorail |year=2015 |website=RailSystem.net |access-date=23 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Maglev ====
{{Main|Maglev}}
To achieve much faster operation over {{convert|500|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, innovative maglev technology has been researched since the early 20th century. The technology uses magnets to levitate the train above the track, reducing friction and allowing higher speeds. An early prototype was demonstrated in 1913. The first commercial maglev train was an [[airport shuttle]] introduced in 1984 at [[Birmingham Airport]] in England.

The [[Shanghai Maglev Train]], opened in 2003, is the fastest commercial train service of any kind, operating at speeds of up to {{convert|430|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Maglev has not yet been used for inter-city [[Public transport|mass transit]] routes.

=== Railcar ===
{{main|Railcar}}
[[Image:Neue Mühle 3.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Bombardier Talent]] articulated regional railcar.]]
A railcar,&lt;!-- (not to be confused with a [[Railroad car|railway car]]), --&gt; in [[British English]] and [[Australian English]], is a self-propelled [[Rail transport|railway]] [[vehicle]] designed to [[transport]] passengers. The term "railcar" is usually used in reference to a train consisting of a single [[Coach (rail)|coach]] (carriage, car), with a driver's cab at one or both ends. Some railways, e.g., the [[Great Western Railway]], used the term [[Railmotor]]. If it is able to pull a full train, it is rather called a [[Rail motor coach|motor coach]] or a motor car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parrypeoplemovers.com/ppm35-feature.htm|title=Light Railcars and Railbuses – Feature article|access-date=9 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106103408/http://www.parrypeoplemovers.com/ppm35-feature.htm|archive-date=6 January 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes also used as an alternative name for the small types of [[multiple unit]] which consist of more than one coach.

=== Other types ===
[[File:'Flying Scotsman' (40944346730).jpg|thumb|A British heritage passenger train hauled by the historic locomotive ''Flying Scotsman'']]

;Named trains
{{See also|Lists of named passenger trains}}
Railway companies often give a name to a train service as a marketing exercise, to attract more passengers and gain recognition for the company.  Naming is usually reserved for the most prestigious services, such as high-speed express trains that run between major cities, stopping at few intermediate stations, or for particularly luxurious trains.

The names of special passenger trains have passed into popular culture: the ''[[Orient Express]]'' has been a setting for films and other works of fiction.  The ''[[Flying Scotsman (train)|Flying Scotsman]]'', ''[[Golden Arrow (train)|Golden Arrow]]'', and ''[[Royal Scot (train)|Royal Scot]]'' are examples of famous British trains; the ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' and ''[[California Zephyr]]'' are particularly well known in the US; and the ''[[Red Arrow (Russian train)|Red Arrow]]'' is a celebrated Russian sleeper train. In India, some of the popular specially-named train services are the [[Brindavan Express]] (Chennai–Bengaluru), [[Deccan Queen]] (Mumbai CST–Pune), and [[Flying Ranee]] (Mumbai Central–Surat).

A less common practice is the naming of freight trains, for the same commercial reasons. In the 1960s, the "Condor" was an overnight London–Glasgow express goods train, hauled by pairs of [[British Rail Class 28|"Metrovick"]] diesel locomotives. In the mid-1960s, [[British Rail]] introduced the [[Freightliner (UK)|"Freightliner"]] brand, for the new train services carrying [[containerization|containers]] between dedicated terminals around the rail network. The [[Wilbert Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]] also named freight trains, coining the name "Flying Kipper" for the overnight express fish train that appeared in his stories in ''[[The Railway Series]]'' books.

;Airport trains
{{Main|People mover}}
Airport trains transport people between terminals within an airport complex.

;Heritage trains
{{Main|Heritage railway}}
Heritage trains are operated by volunteers, often [[railfans]], as a tourist attraction. Usually trains are formed from historic vehicles retired from national commercial operation.

;Mine trains
Mine trains are operated in large mines and carry both workers and goods.

;Overland trains
[[Overland train]]s are used to carry cargo over rough terrain.

== Freight trains ==
{{Main|Rail freight transport}}

[[File:WCML freight train.jpg|thumb|British electric container freight train]]
[[File:Union Pacific train (26862149220).jpg|thumb|A [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] freight train]]

A [[freight train]] (or "goods train") uses [[Goods wagon|freight cars or wagons]] (also known as "trucks" or "goods wagons") to transport goods or materials (cargo)&amp;nbsp;– essentially any train that is not used for carrying passengers. Much of the world's freight is transported by train, and the rail system in the US is used mostly for transporting freight rather than passengers.

Under the right circumstances, transporting freight by train is highly economic, and also more energy efficient than transporting freight by road. Rail freight is most economic when goods are being carried in bulk and over large distances, but it is less suited to short distances and small loads. Bulk aggregate movements of a mere {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} can be cost effective, even allowing for [[Transshipment|trans-shipment]] costs which dominate in many cases; modern practices such as [[intermodal container]] freight are aimed at minimizing these costs.

The main disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility and for this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to [[road transport|road competition]]. Many governments are trying to encourage more freight back onto trains because of the benefits that it would bring.

There are many different types of freight train, used for carrying a huge variety of different kinds of freight, with various types of [[Railroad car#Freight cars|wagon]]. One of the most common types on modern railways are intermodal (container) trains, where the containers can be lifted on and off the train by [[crane (machine)|cranes]] and loaded off or onto trucks or ships. In the US, this type of freight train has largely superseded the traditional [[boxcar]] (wagon-load) type of freight train, which requires the cargo to be loaded or unloaded manually. In Europe the [[Covered goods wagon#Sliding wall wagons|sliding wall wagon]] has taken over from the ordinary [[covered goods wagon]].

In some countries "[[Piggy-back (transportation)#Rail|piggy-back]]" trains or [[rolling highway]]s are used. In the latter case trucks can drive straight onto the train and drive off again when the end destination is reached. A system like this is used through the [[Channel Tunnel]] between England and France, and for the trans-Alpine service between France and Italy (this service uses [[Gondola (rail)#Modalohr road trailer carriers|Modalohr road trailer carriers]]). "Piggy-back" trains are the fastest growing type of freight train in the US, where they are also known as "[[Semi-trailer|trailer]] on [[flatcar]]" or TOFC trains. Piggy-back trains require no special modifications to the vehicles being carried. An alternative type of "intermodal" vehicle, known as a [[roadrailer]], is designed to be physically attached to the train. The original trailers were fitted with two sets of wheels: one set flanged, for the trailer to run connected to other such trailers as a rail vehicle in a train; and one set with tires, for use as the [[semi-trailer]] of a road vehicle. More modern trailers have only road wheels and are designed to be carried on specially adapted [[bogie]]s (trucks) when moving on rails.

There are also many other types of wagon, such as [[well car|"low loader" wagons or well wagons]] for transporting road vehicles. There are [[refrigerator car]]s for transporting foods such as ice cream. There are simple types of [[Gondola (rail)|open-topped wagons]] for transporting minerals and bulk material such as coal, and [[tank car|tankers]] for transporting liquids and gases. Today, however, most coal and aggregates are moved in [[hopper car|hopper wagons]] that can be filled and discharged rapidly, to enable efficient handling of the materials.

Freight trains are sometimes illegally boarded by passengers who want a free ride, or do not have the money to travel by ordinary means. This is referred to as "[[freighthopping]]." A common way of boarding the train illegally is by sneaking into a train yard and stowing away in an unattended boxcar; a more dangerous practice is trying to catch a train "on the fly", that is, while it is moving, leading to occasional fatalities. Railroads treat it as trespassing and may prosecute it as such.

{{Main|Tennis}}
Players use different '''[[tennis]] strategies''' to enhance their own strengths and exploit their opponent's weaknesses in order to gain the advantage and win more [[Point (tennis)|points]].

Players typically specialize or naturally play in a certain way, based on what they can do best. Based on their style, players generally fit into one of three types, ''baseliners'', ''volleyers'', ''all-court players''. Many players have attributes of all three categories but, at times, may also focus on just one style based on the surface, or on the condition, or on the opponent. 

A ''baseliner'' plays from the back of the [[tennis court]], around/behind/within the baseline, preferring to hit [[groundstroke]]s, allowing themselves more time to react to their opponent’s shots, rather than to come up to the net (except in certain situations). 

A ''volleyer'' plays nearer towards the net, preferring to hit [[Volley (tennis)|volley]]s, allowing less time for their opponent to react to their shots, rather than to stay/play from further back on the [[tennis court]] (except in certain situations). 

''All-court players'' fall somewhere in between, employing both ''baseliner'' strategies and ''volleyer'' strategies depending on the situations.

A player's weaknesses may also determine strategy. For example, most players have a stronger forehand, therefore they will favor the forehand even to the point of "running around" a backhand to hit a forehand.

==Baseliner==

=== Offensive baseliner ===

An offensive or aggressive baseliner tries to control and dictate play by hitting powerful groundstrokes for winners usually from the area of the baseline or behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aggressive Baseline Tennis |url=http://www.tennis-betfair.com/uk/tennis-guide/aggressive-baseline-tennis.html |website=Tennis-Betfair |publisher=Tennis-Betfair |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An effective offensive baseliner can overpower many opponents, however, when going for winners, they can also produce many ''errors'' since they have to repeatedly and correctly execute some difficult strokes, such as down-the-line winners landing near the corner.  Fatigue, loss of focus, mis-hitting the ball, and hesitating are some reasons for errors.  Two great old-time players, [[R. Norris Williams]] and [[Ellsworth Vines]], were famous for being unbeatable when their strokes were "on". However, they played with such little margin for error in making their strokes that when they were making more mistakes they could be beaten by other players. Another advantage of this strategy is that the player can weaken his opponent's confidence by successfully landing difficult shots which in turn may increase his own confidence.

Hard courts are generally considered to be the best surface for an offensive baseliner who often hit higher risk shots. However, offensive baseliners can often excel on both [[grass]] and clay courts as well. On grass, they can execute their "winners" and the fast, low bounce makes it harder for opponents to retrieve; whereas on [[clay]] courts, some offensive baseliners might like the slow and high bounce because it gives them a longer time to change their grip and foot-positions in order to set up for an offensive shot or winner.  Offensive baseliners with height especially have an advantage on clay courts because the high bounces land in their hitting zones, allowing them to strike the ball cleanly and more powerfully. One great example for this is [[Maria Sharapova]], who is 6'2", and the high bounce of the ball really helps her produce winners and force errors from her opponents. She had the hardest hit backhand at the [[2013 French Open]] from the women's side, when she punished a first serve from [[Jelena Jankovic]], producing a backhand return winner.

[[Ivan Lendl]] was the first player to popularize this style of playing in modern era professional tennis. [[Steffi Graf]] and [[Monica Seles]] were the pioneers on the women's side. [[Serena Williams]] is also known for excelling with this style. [[Rafael Nadal]] is accomplished at an offensive baseline playstyle, using a variety of high-spin shots and powerful flat strokes to dominate play, most notably on clay, which he is known to be very good at (though he usually prefers to play a defensive baseline style).{{cn|date=April 2017}} [[Novak Djokovic]], though known to be an all-rounder, is also a notable aggressive baseliner, with his powerful and precise backhand which is widely regarded as the best backhand of any active player.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

=== Defensive baseliner ===
{{See also|Pusher (tennis)}}
A defensive baseliner, ''counter-puncher'' or ''retriever'', tries to return every ball and relies on the opponent making mistakes. The trademarks of a counterpuncher include consistent shots with low error rate, as well as precise placement that makes it hard for their opponent to execute an aggressive shot. Counterpunchers also have a tendency to anticipate and are usually equipped with extremely good passing shots, thus enabling them to turn lots of defensive situations into offence. The game of the defensive counter-puncher has more to do with physical endurance and willingness to get every ball back in play as well as mental determination to keep from getting bored or trying for too much. Their game plan often involves moving their opponents back to the court and outmaneuvering their opponents. One example is former world number one [[Caroline Wozniacki]] who moves her opponent around the court without going for high risk winners. While on defence, she gets every ball back and constantly mixes up the pace, to frustrate her opponents.

While they tend to make relatively few errors because they do not attempt the complicated and ambitious shots of the aggressive baseliner, the effective counterpuncher must be able to periodically execute an aggressive shot, either using the pace given by their opponent or using precision and angle. Speed and agility are key for the counterpuncher, as well as a willingness to patiently chase down every ball to frustrate opponents. Returning every aggressive shot that the opponent provides is often the cause of further errors due to the effort required in trying increasingly harder and better shots. However, it is noted that for some faster players, including [[Gaël Monfils]], [[Lleyton Hewitt]] and [[Andy Murray]], standing too deep behind the court can hinder their attacking abilities.

At lower levels, the defensive counter-puncher often frustrates their opponent so much that they may try to change their style of play due to ineffective baseline results. At higher levels, the all-court player or aggressive baseliner is usually able to execute winners with higher velocity and better placement, taking the counterpuncher out of the point as early as possible.

Most counter-punchers often excel on slow courts, such as clay. The court gives them extra time to chase down shots and it is harder for opponents to create winners. However, some counter-punchers who have the ability to mix up their game and turn defense into offense, like Lleyton Hewitt,&lt;ref name="Federer hails 'unbelievable' Hewitt for inspiring a generation on grass courts"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/27/roger-federer-lleyton-hewitt-wimbledon|title=Federer hails 'unbelievable' Hewitt for inspiring a generation on grass courts|work=The Guardian|date=27 June 2015|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Murray&lt;ref name="No surface tension as Murray looks to shed his feet of clay"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sporter/tennis/no-surface-tension-as-murray-looks-to-shed-his-feet-of-clay-1667477.html|title=No surface tension as Murray looks to shed his feet of clay|work=The Independent|location=London|date=12 April 2009|accessdate=26 June 2009|last=Newman|first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Agnieszka Radwanska]] have excelled on faster courts like hard and grass as well as slower courts. Counter-punchers are often particularly strong players at low-level play, where opponents cannot make winners with regularity.

==Volleyer==
{{Main|Serve and volley}}
A serve and volleyer has a great net game, is quick around the net, and has fine touch for [[Volley (tennis)|volleys]]. ''[[Serve and volley]]ers'' come up to the net at every opportunity when serving. They are almost always attackers and can hit many ''winners'' with varieties of volleys and [[Drop shot|drop volleys]]. When not serving, they often employ the "chip-and-charge", chipping back the serve without attempting to hit a winner and rushing the net. The serve-and-volleyers' strategy is to put pressure on the opponent to try to hit difficult passing shots. This strategy is extremely effective against [[Pusher (tennis)|pushers]].

Serve-and-volleyers benefit from playing on fast courts, such as grass or fast concrete. The quick bounce and faster pace of play give them an advantage because opponents have less time to set up for a passing shot. However, the number of serve-and-volley players is decreasing in today's professional tennis, because this strategy requires more experience to master and defeat other playing styles (as well as changes in racquet technology that have improved players' passing shots). In addition to this, there has been a trend toward the slowing down of tennis surfaces over the past few years. The serve-and-volley technique works better on faster surfaces because the volleyer is able to put more balls away without the baseliner being able to chase them down. Although serve and volleyers may be a dying breed, there are still some great players who employ this tactic. The Frenchman [[Michaël Llodra]] has been considered by many to be the best pure serve and volleyer of today's game.

[[Bill Tilden]], the dominant player of the 1920s, preferred to play from the back of the court, and liked nothing better than to face an opponent who rushed the net — one way or another Tilden would find a way to hit the ball past him. In his book [[Match Play and the Spin of the Ball]], Tilden propounds the theory that ''by definition'' a great baseline player will always beat a great serve-and-volleyer. Some of the best matches of all time have pitted great baseliners such as [[Björn Borg]], [[Mats Wilander]] or [[Andre Agassi]] against great serve-and-volleyers such as [[John McEnroe]], [[Boris Becker]], [[Stefan Edberg]], or [[Pete Sampras]].

Some players, such as [[Tommy Haas]], [[Roger Federer]] and [[Andy Roddick]] will only employ this strategy on grass courts or as a surprise tactic on any surface. [[Roger Federer]] uses this commonly [[Federer–Nadal rivalry|against]] [[Rafael Nadal]], to break up long rallies and physically taxing games.

== All-court player ==
All-court players, or all-rounders, have aspects of every tennis style, whether that be offensive baseliner, defensive counter-puncher or serve-and-volleyer. All-court players use the best bits from each style and mix it together to create a truly formidable tennis style to play against. In game situations they are very versatile; when an all-court player's baseline game is not working, he/she may switch to a net game, and vice versa. All-court players have the ability to adjust to different opponents that play different styles more easily than pure baseliners or serve and volleyers. All-court players typically have the speed, determination and fitness of a defensive counter-puncher, the confidence, skill and flair of offensive baseliners and have the touch, the agility around the net and tactical thinking of the serve-and-volleyer.

However, just because the all-court player has a combination of skills used by all tennis styles does not necessarily mean that they can beat an offensive baseliner or a defensive counter-puncher or even a serve-and-volleyer. It just means it would be more difficult to read the game of an all-court player.

Perfect examples for all-rounders are [[Tim Henman]] or [[Roger Federer]] in men's singles and [[Justine Henin]] or [[Steffi Graf]] in women's singles.

==Serving strategy==
Holding serve is crucial in tennis. To hold serve, serves must be accurately placed, and a high priority should be placed on first serve percentage. In addition, the velocity of serve is important.  A weak serve can be easily attacked by an aggressive returner. The first ball after the serve is also key. Players should serve in order to get a weak return and keep the opponent on the defense with that first shot. For example, following a wide serve, it is ideal to hit the opponent's return to the open court.
There are three different types of serves and each one of them can be used in different situations. One type of serve is the serve with slice. The slice serve works better when the player tosses the ball to the right and immediately hits the outer-right part of the ball. This serve is best used when you hit it wide so you get your opponent off the court. 

Another type is the kick serve. To achieve a good execution, the player must toss the ball above the head and immediately spin the bottom-left part of the ball. Since the ball is tossed above the head, it is necessary for the player to arch correctly under the ball. This serve is best used as second serve because the amount of spin that is added to the ball makes it very safe. The kick serve is also effective when a change of rhythm is needed or when the opponent struggles with the high bounce that results from the effect. 

A third type of serve is the flat one. To execute this serve, the player must toss the ball right in front and immediately hit the middle-top part of the ball. This is usually a very hard serve and therefore risky. However, if the flat serve is executed with enough power and precision, it can turn into a great weapon to win points faster.

==Doubles strategy==
Though strategy is important in singles, it is even more important in doubles. The additional width of the alleys on the doubles court has a great effect on the angles possible in doubles play. Consequently, doubles is known as a game of angles.

There are three basic doubles strategies:
* both-up strategy (also called "two-up" strategy)
* up-and-back strategy (also called "one-up/one-back" or "I" strategy)
* both-back strategy (also called "two-back" strategy)

===Both-up strategy===
The ideal is both-up strategy, often called "Attacking Doubles" because the net is the "high ground", and the both-up strategy puts both players close to it, in a position to score because of their excellent vantage points and angles. A team in the both-up formation, however, is vulnerable to a good [[Lob (tennis)|lob]] from either opponent at any time. To be successful with Attacking Doubles, teams must have effective serves and penetrating [[Volley (tennis)|volleys]] to prevent good lobs and good [[Smash (tennis)|overhead]] shots to put away poor returns.

Teams that play attacking doubles try to get into the both-up formation on every point. When [[Serve (tennis)|serving]], their server follows most first serves to the net and some second serves. As a result, attacking doubles is also called ''serve-and-volley doubles''. When receiving, their receiver follows most second-service returns to the net.

At the professional level, attacking doubles is the standard, though slowly degrading, strategy of choice.

===Up-and-back strategy===
At lower levels of the game, not all players have penetrating volleys and strong overhead shots. So, many use up-and-back strategy. The weakness in this formation is the large angular gap it creates between partners, a gap that an opposing net player can easily hit a clean winner through if they successfully poach a passing shot.

Nonetheless, up-and-back strategy is versatile, with elements of both offense and defense. In fact, since the server must begin each point at the baseline and the receiver must be far enough back to return the serve, virtually every point in doubles begins with both teams in this formation.

Teams without net games strong enough to play Attacking Doubles can still play both-up when they have their opponents on the defensive. To achieve this, a team would patiently play up-and-back for a chance to hit a forcing shot and bring their baseliner to the net.

Australian Doubles and the I-Formation are variations of up-and-back strategy. In Australian doubles, the server's partner at net lines up on the same side of the court, fronting the opposing net player, who serves as a [[Tennis terminology#P|poaching]] block and blind. The receiver then must return serve down the line and is liable to have that return poached. In the I-Formation, the server's net partner lines up in the center, between the server and receiver so he or she can poach in either direction. Both Australian Doubles and the I-Formation are poaching formations that can also be used to start the point for serve-and-volley doubles.

===Both-back strategy===
Both-back strategy is strictly defensive. It is normally seen only when the opposing team is both-up or when the returner is passing the net player on the return. This might be a good tactic when the opponent has a serve with a lot of pressure and an aggressive player at the net. From here the defenders can return the most forcing shots till they get a chance to hit a good lob or an offensive shot. If their opponents at net become impatient and try to angle the ball away when a baseliner can reach it, the defender can turn the tables and score outright. However this strategy leaves the volley court open to drop shots from the opposition.

      <text bytes="7118" xml:space="preserve">Traditionally, [[tennis]] is played between two people in a singles match, or two pairs in a doubles match.

==Standard types of match==
{{anchor|Singles}}'''Singles''' involves two players competing against each other, usually two men or two women, although games between a man and a woman may be played on an informal basis or as [[exhibition game|exhibitions]].

{{anchor|Doubles}}'''Doubles''' is played by two teams of two players each, most often all-male or all-female. It utilizes a wider court than singles matches: it includes the area in the alley (tramlines, in British terminology), whereas singles does not.  The two players on the receiving side change positions after each point played (one at the net and the other near the baseline, preparing to return serve).

{{anchor|Mixed doubles}}'''Mixed doubles''' is played the same as doubles, but with one man and one woman per team. This form of tennis is rare in the professional game because the men's and women's tours are organised separately (by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]], respectively). However, all four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments hold a mixed doubles competition, alongside the men's and women's doubles, featuring many of the same players. There is also an annual mixed tournament for national teams, the [[Hopman Cup]], which includes mixed doubles matches. Additionally, there have been mixed doubles events at the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] on various occasions (In 1900, from 1912 until 1920 and again since [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Mixed doubles|2012]]).

While players are gradually less competitive in singles by their late 20s and early 30s, they can still continue competitively in doubles and mixed doubles (as instanced by [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[John McEnroe]], who won doubles titles in their 40s).

==Other types of match==

===Canadian doubles===
{{Main|Canadian doubles}}
When three players are available, modified rules can accommodate the mismatch so that the single player does not have to be significantly better than the double team. The single player hits into a doubles court while the side with two players hits into a singles court.

=== Australian doubles / American doubles ===
An informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, this is played with similar rules to [[Canadian doubles]], only in this version, players rotate court position after each game. As such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving. Scoring styles vary, but one popular method is to assign a value of 2 points to each game, with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve, and the doubles team each taking one if they break. Throughout the United Kingdom (particularly England) and Australia this format is usually known as "American doubles", whereas in South Africa you would call it "American singles", or cut-throat tennis. It is also found in the Caribbean &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tennistips.org/doubles-tennis.html | title=Doubles Tennis Rules | accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordache tennis===
A game played between three players.  A normal tennis game takes place between two of the three contestants.  Players are awarded 5 points for a game win and the loser is awarded points based on the score achieved: 3 for deuce, 2 for 30 and 1 for 15.  The winner remains in.  The player replacing the loser gets to choose who serves.  The first to 50 wins.  Scoring is calculated continuously, so if a player is currently on 49 points at the start of a game they only have to win one point for the game to end.  There is a variation invented in 2005, called "mini-Jordache", where the first person to 25 points wins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feekhok.com/matches-type.html http://www.feekhok.com/matches-type.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wheelchair tennis===
{{Main|Wheelchair tennis}}
Played in both singles and doubles forms by people in wheelchairs. The main difference is that the ball may bounce twice before it is hit, the second bounce may even be outside the court. All four Grand Slam tournaments include wheelchair tennis.

=== Visually impaired tennis ===
Visually impaired tennis (also known as '''"blind tennis'''" in Japan, its country of origin, and as '''"sound tennis"''' is some parts of the world) is competed in 4 types of classification with the B1 (blind) group  are requires players to wear a blindfold. and utilizes special balls, which make a sound upon contact with the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ibta-takei.com/blind-tennis-history|title=International Blind Tennis Association » Blind tennis history|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually uses a smaller court and a lower net than standard tennis; up to three bounces may be allowed before returning the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tennisfoundation.org.uk/play-tennis/blind-visually-impaired-tennis/|title=Visually impaired tennis|website=Tennis Foundation|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sound tennis is not part of [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]], [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]], and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournaments, an international tournament is held annually, and world rankings are published for male and female players with different degrees of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ibta-takei.com/blind-tennis-classifications|title=International Blind Tennis Association » Blind Tennis World Ranking|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mini-tennis===
There is an evolution in tennis training that employs the use of low compression balls and in some cases modified court sizes. Organizations around the world have begun to use lower compression balls and modified court sizes as a way to reach out to younger tennis players interested in tennis. The use of low compression balls and modified court sizes is meant to ease the process into becoming a competitive or amateur tennis player. The low compression balls are colored differently to indicate the level of compression. Young players and beginners are likely to find the game easier to learn because the balls do not bounce as high or travel as fast as "normal" balls. The modified smaller courts make covering the court, or reaching the opponents shot, easier as well.

A '''tennis court''' is the venue where the sport of [[tennis]] is played. It is a firm rectangular surface with a low net stretched across the centre. The same surface can be used to play both [[Types of tennis match|doubles and singles]] matches. A variety of surfaces can be used to create a tennis court, each with its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game.

==Dimensions==
[[File:Tennis court imperial.svg|thumb|The dimensions of a tennis court.]]
The dimensions of a tennis court are defined and regulated by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) governing body and are written down in the annual 'Rules of Tennis' document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Rules of Tennis|url=http://itf.uberflip.com/i/428396-2015-rules-of-tennis-english/0|publisher=ITF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court is {{convert|78|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} long. Its width is {{convert|27|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} for singles matches and {{convert|36|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} for doubles matches.&lt;ref name="Rule 1 - The Court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itf.uberflip.com/i/428396-2015-rules-of-tennis-english/5|title=Rule 1 – The Court|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service line is {{convert|21|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} from the net.&lt;ref name="Rule 1 - The Court"/&gt; Additional clear space around the court is needed in order for players to reach overrun balls for a total of {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|120|ft|m|abbr=off}} long. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. The net is {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=off}} high at the posts, and {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}} high in the center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/C0125827/tennis.htm Rules of tennis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206102855/http://library.thinkquest.org/C0125827/tennis.htm |date=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The net posts are {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}} outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}} outside the singles court on each side.

===Smaller courts===
The ITF's Play and Stay campaign promotes playing on smaller courts with slower red, orange and green balls for younger children. This gives children more time and control so they can serve, rally, and score from the first lesson on courts that are sized to fit their bodies. The ITF has mandated that official competition for children aged 10 years and under should be played on "Orange" courts {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|6.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. Competition for children under 8 years is played on "Red" courts that are {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. The net is always 0.8 m high in the center.&lt;ref name=playstay&gt;[http://www.tennisplayandstay.com ITF Play and Stay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surfaces==
Tennis is played on a variety of surfaces and each surface has its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game. There are four main types of courts depending on the materials used for the court surface: [[Clay court|clay]] courts, [[hardcourt|hard]] courts, [[Grass court|grass]] courts and [[carpet court]]s. The [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) lists different surfaces and properties and classifies surfaces into one of five pace settings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Pace Classification Programme|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/equipment/courts/class.asp|publisher=ITF|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Category 1 (slow)
* Category 2 (medium-slow)
* Category 3 (medium)
* Category 4 (medium-fast)
* Category 5 (fast)

Of the current four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments, the [[Australian Open|Australian]] and [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] use hard courts, [[French Open]] is played on clay, and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the only Grand Slam to have always been played on the same surface, is played on grass. The Australian Open switched from grass to hard courts in 1988 and in its early years the French championship alternated between clay and sand/rubble courts. The US Open is the only major to have been played on three surfaces; it was played on grass from its inception until 1974, clay from 1975 until 1977 and hard courts since it moved from the [[West Side Tennis Club]] to the [[Billie Jean King National Tennis Center|National Tennis Center]] in 1978.

ITF uses the following classification for tennis court surface types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Approved Tennis Balls, Classified Surfaces &amp; Recognised Courts 2015|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/200593/200593.pdf|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF)|page=62|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clay courts===
{{Main|Clay court}}
[[File:ND DN 2006FO.jpg|thumbnail|The [[French Open]] is played on clay courts.]]
Clay courts are made of crushed shale, stone or brick.&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"/&gt; The French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to use clay courts.

Clay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce in comparison to grass or hard courts.&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"/&gt; For this reason, the clay court takes away many of the advantages of big serves, which makes it hard for serve-based players to dominate on the surface. Clay courts are cheaper to construct than other types of tennis courts, but a clay surface costs more to maintain. Clay courts need to be rolled to preserve flatness. The clay's water content must be balanced; green clay courts generally require the courts to be sloped to allow water run-off.

Clay courts are more common in Europe and Latin America than in North America, and tend to heavily favour baseline players.

Historically for the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slams]] clay courts have been used at the [[French Open]] since 1891 and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] from 1975 to 1977.

===Grass courts===
{{Main|Grass court}}
[[File:London - Wimbledon - 3065.jpg|thumb|right|Grass court maintenance at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]]]
Grass courts are the fastest type of courts in common use.&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"/&gt; They consist of grass grown on very hard-packed soil, which adds additional variables: bounces depend on how healthy the grass is, how recently it has been mowed, and the wear and tear of recent play. [[point (tennis)|Point]]s are usually very quick where fast, low bounces keep rallies short, and the [[serve (tennis)|serve]] plays a more important role than on other surfaces. Grass courts tend to favour [[serve-and-volley]] tennis players.

Grass courts were once among the most common tennis surfaces, but are now rare due to high maintenance costs as they must be watered and mown often, and take a longer time to dry after rain than hard courts.

Historically for the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slams]] grass courts have been used at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] since 1877, the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] from 1881 to 1974, and the [[Australian Open]] from 1905 to 1987.

===Hard courts===
{{Main|Hardcourt}}
[[File:RoofCourt.jpg|thumb|right|Rooftop tennis hardcourts in Downtown [[Singapore]]]]
Hard courts are made of uniform rigid material, often covered with an [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] surface layer&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"/&gt; to offer greater consistency of bounce than other outdoor surfaces.&lt;ref name="Hard Courts Make Tennis Champions"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hard Courts Make Tennis Champions|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/11/03/100597217.pdf|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 November 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hard courts can vary in speed, though they are faster than clay but not as fast as grass courts. The quantity of sand added to the paint can greatly affect the rate at which the ball slows down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennisuniversal.com/Data/product_search_res.asp?SearchCateg=050206&amp;ProductCateg=0500&amp;SubCateg1=0502&amp;SubCateg2=050206This Tennis Universal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716210537/http://www.tennisuniversal.com/Data/product_search_res.asp?SearchCateg=050206&amp;ProductCateg=0500&amp;SubCateg1=0502&amp;SubCateg2=050206This |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Open (Tennis)|US Open]] is played on [[DecoTurf]] while the [[Australian Open]] is played on [[GreenSet]], both acrylic-topped hard court surfaces.

Historically for the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slams]] hard courts have been used at the US Open since 1978 and the Australian Open since 1988.

===Carpet courts===
{{Main|Carpet court}}
[[File:Field club tennis courts in central old part of Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|Artificial turf tennis courts in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]]]
"Carpet" in tennis means any removable court covering.&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/facilities/facilities-guide/surface-descriptions.aspx|title=Surface Descriptions|website=itftennis.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor arenas store rolls of rubber-backed court surfacing and install it temporarily for tennis events, but they are not in use any more for professional events. A short [[pile (textile)|piled]] form of [[artificial turf]] infilled with sand is used for some outdoor courts, particularly in Asia. Carpet is generally a fast surface, faster than hardcourt, with low bounce.&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"/&gt;

Notable tennis tournaments previously held on carpet courts were the [[WCT Finals]], [[Paris Masters]], [[U.S. Pro Indoor]] and [[Kremlin Cup]]. Since 2009, their use has been discontinued on the top tier of the ATP. [[ATP Challenger Tour]] tournaments such as the [[Trofeo Città di Brescia]] still use carpet courts. The WTA Tour's last carpet court event, the [[WTA International tournaments|International]]-level [[Tournoi de Québec]], was discontinued after 2018.

==Indoor courts==
Some tennis courts are indoors, which allows to play regardless of weather conditions and is more comfortable for spectators.

Different court surfaces have been used indoors. Hard courts are most common indoors, as they are the easiest to install and maintain. If the installation is permanent, they are constructed on an asphalt or concrete base, as with outdoor courts. Temporary indoor hard courts are typically constructed using wooden floor panels topped with acrylic which are installed over the venue's standard floor. This is the system used for modern indoor professional events such as the [[ATP Finals]]. 

Clay courts can be installed indoors with subsurface watering systems to keep the clay from drying out, and have been used for [[Davis Cup]] matches. 

Carpet courts were once the most prominent of indoor surfaces, especially in temporary venues, but have largely been replaced by removable hard courts. They were used on both the [[ATP World Tour]] and [[World Championship Tennis]] circuits, though no events currently use them. 

Historically, other surfaces have been used indoors such as [[hardwood flooring]] at the defunct [[World Covered Court Championships]] and [[London Indoor Professional Championships]].

The conclusion of the [[Wimbledon Championships]], in 2012, was played on the lawn of [[Centre Court]] under the closed roof and artificial lights; the [[Halle Open]] has also seen a number of matches played on its grass court in the [[Gerry Weber Stadion]] with the roof closed. These, however, are outdoor venues with retractable roofs.

==Terminology==
{{main|Glossary of tennis terms}}

Common tennis court terms:

* ''Advantage service box'' or ''ad court'': The receiver's left side service box, or the opponent's right for the server; significant as the receiving side for an advantage point.
* ''Alley'' or ''Tramlines'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/rules_and_equipment/4222680.stm | title=BBC Sports: Basic rules of tennis | accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lanes on each side of the singles court. These are only used when playing doubles.
* ''Back court'': The area between the baseline and the service line.
* ''Baseline'': The rearmost line of the court, furthest from and parallel to the net.
* ''Center service line'': The line dividing the two service boxes on each side.
* ''Center mark'': The 4-inch mark at the halfway point of the baseline used to distinguish the two halves (and service boxes) of a tennis court.
* ''Deuce service box'' or ''deuce court'': The receiver's right side service box, or the opponent's left for the server, significant as the receiving side for a deuce point.
* ''Service box'': The area on each side bounded by the singles sideline, the service line, and the net. There are left and right service boxes, separated by the center service line.
* ''Service line'': The line that is parallel to the net and is located between the baseline and the net. It marks the end of the service boxes.
* ''Side T'': The T shape formed by the service line and the singles sideline. There are four such side Ts, two on each side of the net.
* ''T'' or ''Middle T'': The T shape formed by the service line and the center service line.

{{Original research|date=April 2017}}
{{Cleanup list|date=April 2017}}
{{italic title}}
The [[phrase]] '''''Anyone for tennis?''''' is thought to have originated from [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1914 play ''[[Misalliance]]'', in which Johnny Tarleton asks "Anybody on for a game of tennis?"&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Shaw, George. 1914. ''Misalliance''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This phrase is often used to typify a particular genre of [[drawing room play|drawing room comedy]] about the leisured upper class.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

This phrase has been used several times in popular culture, including in the song "Beautiful Girl" in the movie musical ''[[Singin' in the Rain]],'' and as the [[Anyone for Tennis|title of a song]] by the British blues-rock band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. It is also mentioned in the popular 1975 song ''[[Spanish Train and Other Stories|Patricia the Stripper]]'' by [[Chris de Burgh]].

Other uses of the phrase in pop culture include:

* The stage play ''[[Anyone for Denis? (video)|Anyone for Denis?]]'', referring to [[Denis Thatcher]].
* In June 2012, after the [[England national football team|English national football team]] was eliminated from that year's [[UEFA Euro 2012|European championships]], ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper announced that Britain could still win [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], using the headline "Anyone for Tennis?" Two weeks later when British hopeful [[Andy Murray]] lost the Wimbledon final, ''The Sun'' asked "Anyone for Ennis?" in reference to hopes that English track-and-field athlete [[Jessica Ennis]] could take home the gold in that year's [[2012 Summer Games|Summer Olympics]].
* [[Daffy Duck]] used the phrase in the cartoons ''[[Rabbit Fire]], [[Drip-Along Daffy]]'' and ''[[The Ducksters]]''.

==History==
{{main article|History of tennis}}
Women's tennis is present from the first [[Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in 1900 in Paris and 1908 in London, but the women's doubles only appeared in 1920 at the Antwerp Games.

One of the first superstars of women's tennis is [[Suzanne Lenglen]], who after six titles won at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the Internationaux de France leaves the amateur tennis to achieve a first professional tour in North America in 1926-1927. It is then considered a " Diva " 2.

However women's tennis not really become established until the 1960s, and especially with the establishment of the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= WOMEN'S TENNIS, MONEY, AND THE UPHILL BATTLE FOR EQUALITY|work= [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=|url= https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/womens-tennis-money-and-the-uphill-battle-for-equality|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of women's tennis==
In women's tennis matches the ball is usually played without effect (less than lift) and games tend to play more from the baseline; typing is generally less powerful than men. The game is made in a more tactical speed and anticipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=dRzACQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=tennis+f%C3%A9minin&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBGoVChMI0ZjJrqzYxwIVQu8UCh34IAlY#v=onepage&amp;q=tennis%20f%C3%A9minin&amp;f=false |title=Succčs en Tennis: La Science derričre les Performance |author=Cesar Coutinho |page=142 |website=Books.google.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service is also less powerful; it is relatively less important than for men. However, there has been a noted evolution in this field since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Glam Slam: How Women's Tennis Is Making the Richest Sportswomen in History Even Richer|work= Time|date=|url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2117785,00.html|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Women's Tennis Changes Its Game|work= Newsweek|date=|url= http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_12/b4220022715912.htm|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This injury categorizes as a tendon injury where it occurs in the forearm muscle called the extensor carpi radialis brevis ([[ECRB]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Lateral epicondylitis in tennis: update on aetiology, biomechanics and treatment|url = http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/41/11/816|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|date = 2007-11-01|issn =  1473-0480|pmc = 2465303|pmid = 17616547|pages = 816–819|volume = 41|issue = 11|doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2007.036723|first = Thomas De|last = Smedt|first2 = Andy de|last2 = Jong|first3 = Wim Van|last3 = Leemput|first4 = Dossche|last4 = Lieven|first5 = Francis Van|last5 = Glabbeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury is regularly developed in recreational players.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Experienced players are less likely to develop lateral epicondylitis than the inexperienced players due to poorer technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The effect of tennis racket grip size on forearm muscle firing patterns. |date = 1992|journal = Am J Sports Med|doi =10.1177/0363546506290185 |pmid = 16861576|access-date = |volume = 34|issue = 12 |pages = 1977–83 | last1 = Hatch | first1 = George F. | last2 = Pink | first2 = Marilyn M. | last3 = Mohr | first3 = Karen J. | last4 = Sethi | first4 = Paul M. | last5 = Jobe | first5 = Frank W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 	Tennis elbow or lateral epicondylalgia is a common injury that occurs in 40-50% of tennis players. It is more prominent at the lower levels of play and usually comes from any incorrect use of the wrist or grip on the forehand or one-handed backhand strokes&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dines|first=Joshua S|date=2015|title=Tennis Injuries: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Treatment|url=|journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Players at higher levels often have more relaxed grips and have a larger racquet extension out to the ball after they make contact, where professionals have less emphasis on the arm and more on the use of every part of the body in order exert the natural power behind the ball, lower level players don’t always receive the training on how to use their whole body for a tennis stroke and are often reduced to using their arms in order to exert all of the power, therefore putting heavy strain on the arm&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

Most players respond well to simple rest, but other means of treatment include physical therapy, strength training, and electrical stimulation&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. Some players will make alterations to their racquet, such as increasing their grip size which will ultimately prevent any unwanted movement of the wrist when extending out and finishing the tennis stroke&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;.

=== Shoulder ===
[[Sports injury|Shoulder injury]] is another common type of tennis injury. Shoulder injuries are caused by the repetitive use of shoulder&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Shoulder injuries in tennis players|url = http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/40/5/435|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|date = 2006-05-01|issn = 1473-0480|pmc = 2577490|pmid = 16632575|pages = 435–440|volume = 40|issue = 5|doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2005.023218|first = H. van der|last = Hoeven|first2 = W.

It is common for tennis players, at all levels of play, to have experienced back injury throughout their career.

In order to relieve pain in the lower back people are often told to rest it, but no longer than two days because of its potential damage to the bones, connecting tissue, and cardiovascular system. Once the back pain has dispersed stretching is recommended in order to prevent the stiffness from the initial pain, with examples being the [[squatting position]] or spinal extensions. In order to prevent future lower back injuries strength training to the abdominal muscles is necessary to strengthen the abdomen, and to protect the back from excessive intervertebral disk strain. The straight crunch, the Oblique crunch, and balance exercises with the gym ball are some of the workouts for abdominal strengthening, but the exercises should be done with caution to prevent any further back strain. After the injury is dealt with, players at any level may return to the court, the higher level players will often go through proper stretching before any matches to prevent hurting their back or any other part of their body.

=== Blister ===
[[Blister]] can be described as a patch that appears on the skin and is filled with a clear fluid and sometimes blood. During physical activities, the continuous force of friction, cutting, squeezing and scratching, which causes the separation of the epidermal cell layer, as a result the blister is formed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sock Systems to Prevent Foot Blisters and the Impact on Overuse Injuries of the Knee Joint|journal = Military Medicine|date = 2009-01-01|volume = 174|issue = 2|doi = 10.7205/milmed-d-01-8508|pmid = 19317200|first = Damien|last = Van Tiggelen|first2 = Simon|last2 = Wickes|first3 = Pascal|last3 = Coorevits|first4 = Mich|last4 = Dumalin|first5 = Erik|last5 = Witvrouw|pages=183–189|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blister (foot) occurs frequently among marathon runners, walk racers, backpackers and in hiking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In tennis, the blister development site often occurs on the hand or around the fingers because the skin is consistently rubbing against the [[Racket (sports equipment)|tennis racquet]]. Blisters can also occur on the backside of the feet due to wearing the wrong sized shoe, worn out shoes, too thin of socks, or improper foot work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tennisgems.com/how-to-prevent-blisters-on-hands-and-feet-in-tennis/|title=How to Prevent Blisters on Hands and Feet in Tennis|date=2019-01-12|website=Tennis Gems|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leg ===
Tennis leg is the most common tennis injury within older tennis players. Tennis leg is an incomplete tear or rupture of the calf muscle.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stopsportsinjuries.org/STOP/STOP/Prevent_injuries/tennis_injury_prevention.aspx|title=Tennis Leg Care and Treatment: One to One Physical Therapy|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The injury is noticed right away by hearing a popping sound, or a jabbed feeling in the leg. The injury is very painful; players are unable to finish their match if injury occurs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;After injury occurs, players should rest, ice, compress, and elevate injury. In most cases, physical therapy is required. Physical therapy lasts from a four to six week period; includes running, stretching, and jumping drills to strengthen the muscle.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;After recovery, returning to play is slow; prevention includes proper stretching and warmup before play, rolling out muscles, and cross training, such as, Pilates, cycling, or running.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Knee ===
Patellar tendinopathy is an overuse injury of the patellar tendon.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/scienceandmedicine/injury-clinic/tennis-injuries/jumpers-knee.aspx|title=Jumper’s Knee|last=|first=|date=|website=International Tennis Federation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its more common name is Jumper’s knee. Common injury in tennis players due to constant jarring, jumping, and quick changes of motion while in play.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Common symptoms are pain below the knee cap, or an aching pain after playing. Recovery for Jumping knee includes strengthening the thigh muscle, stretching the front and back of the thigh, hamstrings, quadriceps, and coordination training.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Another more permanent knee injury is chondromalacia. Unlike jumper’s knee, this injury is unreversible. Symptoms are pain in the front of the kneecap.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.orthoteam.com/blog/tennis-injuries-most-common-how-to-prevent-therapy-for.|title=Tennis Injuries: Most Common, How to Prevent, Therapy For|last=Havens|first=Kristen|date=7 July 2006|website=Coastal Orthopedics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;This condition is due to the gradual breakdown of the cartilage in the knee.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Stress Fractures ===
Stress fractures are considered one of the most common injuries in athletes. In tennis, stress fractures are due to repetitive jarring and excessive submaximal loads on bones and muscles.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maquirriain, Ghisi|first=J, J.P.|date=May 2006|title=The Incidence and Distribution of Stress Fractures in Elite Tennis Players|url=|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=40|pages=454|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The number one symptom of stress fractures is pain. Symptoms of stress fractures in the feet include tenderness and swelling.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Stress fractures are common in hands,feet, shins, and the last five vertebrae of the back&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Female tennis players are set at higher risk to stress fractures than males.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Wrist and arm stress fractures can lead to greater issues such as tendonitis.

'''Tennis''' is a [[racket sport]] that can be played individually against a single opponent ([[Types of tennis match#Singles|singles]]) or between two teams of two players each ([[Types of tennis match#Doubles|doubles]]). Each player uses a [[tennis racket]] that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber [[Tennis ball|ball]] covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's [[tennis court|court]]. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.

Tennis is an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including [[Wheelchair tennis|wheelchair users]]. The modern game of tennis originated in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], in the late 19th century as '''lawn tennis'''.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Baker (1988). "Sports in the Western World". p. 182. University of Illinois Press,&lt;/ref&gt; It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as [[croquet]] and [[bowls]] as well as to the older racket sport today called [[real tennis]]. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term ''tennis'' referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis.

The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the [[Tiebreak (tennis)|tiebreak]] in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the [[line call]] of a point, a system known as [[Hawk-Eye]].

Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the [[Australian Open]] played on [[hard court]]s, the [[French Open]] played on red [[clay court]]s, [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] played on [[grass court]]s, and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] also played on hard courts.

[[File:Jeu de paume002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|''Jeu de paume'' in the 17th century]]
Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern [[France]], where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillmeister|first=Heiner|title=Tennis : A Cultural History|url=https://archive.org/details/tennisculturalhi0000gill|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=New York University Press|location=Washington Square, N.Y.|isbn=0-8147-3121-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/tennisculturalhi0000gill/page/117 117]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis X of France]] was a keen player of ''[[jeu de paume]]'' ("game of the palm"), which evolved into [[real tennis]], and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris "around the end of the 13th century".&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Paul B.|title=Daily life in the Middle Ages|year=2001|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-0897-9|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; In June 1316 at [[Vincennes]], Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either [[pneumonia]] or [[pleurisy]], although there was also suspicion of poisoning.&lt;ref name=Gillmeister&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillmeister|first=Heiner|title=Tennis : A Cultural History|url=https://archive.org/details/tennisculturalhi0000gill|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=Leicester University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-7185-0195-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tennisculturalhi0000gill/page/17 17–21]|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name.&lt;ref name=Gillmeister/&gt; Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King [[Charles V of France]], who had a court set up at the [[Louvre Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Moyer Heathcote |author2=C.

It was not until the 16th century that [[tennis racket|racket]]s came into use and the game began to be called "tennis", from the [[French language|French]] term ''tenez'', which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!", an [[interjection]] used as a call from the server to his opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tennis |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=10 June 1927 |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. [[Henry VIII of England]] was a big fan of this game, which is now known as [[real tennis]].&lt;ref&gt;Crego, Robert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XCl1c2yy5ooC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22real+tennis%22+and+tenez&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GrD8S8GtIcT68Abk173KBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22real%20tennis%22%20and%20tenez&amp;f=false Sports and Games of the 18th and 19th Centuries]'', page 115 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th and early 19th centuries, as real tennis declined, new racket sports emerged in England.&lt;ref name="Perris"/&gt;

The invention of the first [[lawn mower]] in 1830, in Britain, is believed to have been a catalyst, for the preparation of modern-style grass courts, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, greens, etc. This in turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn tennis, most football codes, lawn bowls and others.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins of the modern game ===
[[File:Tennis birthplace Edgbaston.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Augurio Perera]]'s house in [[Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]], where he and [[Harry Gem]] first played the modern game of lawn tennis]]
Between 1859 and 1865 [[Harry Gem]], a solicitor and his friend [[Augurio Perera]] developed a game that combined elements of [[racquets (sport)|racquets]] and the Basque ball game [[Basque pelota|pelota]], which they played on Perera's [[croquet]] lawn in [[Birmingham]] in England.&lt;ref name="countrylife"&gt;Tyzack, Anna, [http://www.countrylife.co.uk/news/culture/article/79487/The_True_Home_of_Tennis.html The True Home of Tennis] ''Country Life'', 22 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Harry Gem Project|url=http://www.theharrygemproject.co.uk/|publisher=theharrygemproject.co.uk|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, along with two local doctors, they founded the world's first tennis club on Avenue Road, [[Leamington Spa]].&lt;ref name=LTC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leamington-tennis-squash.co.uk/club-history|title=Leamington Tennis Club|accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where "lawn tennis" was used as a name of activity by a club for the first time. After Leamington, the second club to take up the game of lawn tennis appears to have been the Edgbaston Archery and Croquet Society, also in Birmingham.

In ''Tennis: A Cultural History'', Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on December 8, 1874, British army officer [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]] wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he (Wingfield) had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis “for a year and a half”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leamingtonrealtennis.co.uk/history-of-the-game/leamington-and-tennis.html|title=Leamington Tennis Court Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1873, Wingfield designed and patented a game which he called ''sphairistikè'' ({{lang-el|σφαιριστική}}, meaning "ball-playing"), and was soon known simply as "sticky" – for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate of [[Nantclwyd Hall]], in [[Llanelidan]], Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/sphairistik%C3%A9-anyone|title=Sphairistiké, Anyone?|magazine=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|author=E. M. Halliday|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to R. D. C. Evans, turfgrass [[agronomist]], "Sports historians all agree that [Wingfield] deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis."&lt;ref name="Perris"&gt;J. Perris

In the U.S. in 1874 [[Mary Ewing Outerbridge]], a young socialite, returned from Bermuda with a sphairistikè set. She became fascinated by the game of tennis after watching British army officers play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimsley|first=Will|title=Tennis: Its History, People and Events|year=1971|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-903377-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/tennisitshistory00grim/page/9 9]|url=https://archive.org/details/tennisitshistory00grim/page/9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She laid out a tennis court at the [[Staten Island Cricket Club]] at Camp Washington, Tompkinsville, [[Staten Island]], New York.

On 21 May 1881, the oldest nationwide tennis organization in the world&lt;ref&gt;[Heiner Gillmeister ''Tennis: A Cultural History'']&lt;/ref&gt; was formed, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the [[United States Tennis Association]]) in order to standardize the rules and organize competitions.&lt;ref name=USTA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usta.com/communitytennis/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=95424&amp;icategoryid=437|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030214640/http://www.usta.com/communitytennis/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=95424&amp;icategoryid=437|archivedate=30 October 2007|title=History of United States Tennis Association|accessdate=29 May 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. National Men's Singles Championship, now the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], was first held in 1881 at the [[Newport Casino]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ri.gov/facts/trivia.php|title=Fact &amp; History |work= Rhodes Island Government|accessdate=29 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2011.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/history.html|title=History of the U.S. National Championships/US Open|publisher=USOpen.org|accessdate=2 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603131646/http://2011.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/history.html|archive-date=3 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), now the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF), was founded and established three official tournaments as the major championships of the day. The [[World Grass Court Championships]] were awarded to Great Britain.  The [[World Hard Court Championships]] were awarded to France; the term "hard court" was used for clay courts at the time. Some tournaments were held in Belgium instead. And the [[World Covered Court Championships]] for indoor courts was awarded annually; Sweden, France, Great Britain, Denmark, Switzerland and Spain each hosted the tournament.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bensen |first1=Clark |title=The World Championships of 1913 to 1923: the Forgotten Majors |url=http://www.tenniscollectors.org/journal/number30/tca30_text_p467.pdf |website=tenniscollectors.org |publisher=Journal of The Tennis Collectors of America |accessdate=5 September 2018 |location=Newport, RI, United States |page=470 |date=2013-2014 |quote=Number 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting held on 16 March 1923 in Paris, the title 'World Championship' was dropped and a new category of Official Championship was created for events in Great Britain, France, the United States, and Australia – today's Grand Slam events.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ITF: History |url=https://www.itftennis.com/about/organisation/history.aspx |website=ITF Tennis |publisher=International Tennis Federation |accessdate=5 September 2018 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact on the four recipient nations to replace the ‘world championships’ with ‘official

== Equipment ==
{{Main|Tennis technology}}
Part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a [[racket (sports equipment)|racket]] and balls.

=== Rackets ===
{{main|Racket (sports equipment)#Tennis}}
The components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.
[[File:Reket Franje Punčeca.jpg|thumb|Racket of [[Franjo Punčec]] in a wooden frame – late 1930s]]

Under modern rules of tennis, the rackets must adhere to the following guidelines;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Tennis&amp;nbsp;– Technical&amp;nbsp;– Appendix II|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/equipment/appendixii.asp|publisher=ITF|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The hitting area, composed of the strings, must be flat and generally uniform.
* The frame of the hitting area may not be more than {{convert|29|in|cm}} in length and {{convert|12.5|in|cm}} in width.
* The entire racket must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any energy source built into the rackets.
* The rackets must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match.

The rules regarding rackets have changed over time, as material and engineering advances have been made. For example, the maximum length of the frame had been {{convert|32|in|cm}} until 1997, when it was shortened to {{convert|29|in|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Tennis&amp;nbsp;– Technical&amp;nbsp;– The Racket|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/history/racket.asp|publisher=ITF|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many companies manufacture and distribute tennis rackets. Wilson, Head and Babolat are some of the more commonly used brands; however, many more companies exist.{{Example needed|date=September 2018}} The same companies sponsor players to use these rackets in the hopes that the company name will become more well known by the public.
[[File:Tennis Racket and Balls.jpg|thumb|A tennis racket and balls.]]

=== Balls ===
{{main|Tennis ball}}

Tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimsley|first=Will|title=Tennis: Its History, People and Events: Styles of the Greats|year=1971|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-903377-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/tennisitshistory00grim/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/tennisitshistory00grim/page/14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern tennis balls are made of hollow [[vulcanized rubber]] with a [[felt]] coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]], and bounce to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as {{convert|65.41|–|68.58|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Balls must weigh between {{convert|56.0|and|59.4|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Rule 3 – The Ball|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/history/index.asp#2006|publisher=ITF|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Although the process of producing the balls has remained virtually unchanged for the past 100 years, the majority of manufacturing now takes place in the [[Far East]]. The relocation is due to cheaper [[labour costs]] and materials in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Balls- Manufacture|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/balls/other/manufacture.aspx|publisher=ITF|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tournaments that are played under the ITF Rules of Tennis must use balls that are approved by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and be named on the official ITF list of approved tennis balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/media/298557/298557.pdf|title=ITF Rules of Tennis|publisher=International Tennis Federation|access-date=23 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscellaneous ===
Advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements. Vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players' grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out of their eyes as well. Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear.

{{For|individual terms|Glossary of tennis}}

=== Court ===
{{Main|Tennis court}}

Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 [[foot (length)|feet]] (23.77&amp;nbsp;m) long, and {{convert|27|ft|m}} wide for singles matches and {{convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}} for doubles matches.&lt;ref name=TCS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsknowhow.com/tennis/dimensions/tennis-court-dimensions.html|publisher=Sportsknowhow.com|title=Tennis court dimensions|accessdate=29 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a cord or metal cable of diameter no greater than {{convert|0.8|cm|in|frac=3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ITF Rules"&gt;{{cite web|last=International Tennis Federation|title=ITF Rules of Tennis|url=http://assets.usta.com/assets/1/15/ITF%20-%20RoT%202010.pdf|work=United States Tennis Association Website|publisher=USTA|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The net is {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m}} high at the posts and {{convert|3|ft|m}} high in the center.&lt;ref name=TCS/&gt; The net posts are {{convert|3|ft|m}} outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, {{convert|3|ft|m}} outside the singles court on each side.

The modern tennis court owes its design to Major [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]]. In 1873, Wingfield patented a court much the same as the current one for his [[Stické|stické tennis]] (sphairistike). This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield's version, but with the [[hourglass]] shape of his court changed to a rectangle.&lt;ref name="Tennis court history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/equipment/courts/history.asp|title=Tennis court history&amp;nbsp;– Grass|publisher=ITF|accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces.&lt;ref name="ITF court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/facilities/facilities-guide/surface-descriptions.aspx|title=Surface Descriptions|publisher=International Tennis Federation|access-date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[grass court|Grass]], [[clay court|clay]], and [[hardcourt]]s of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. Occasionally carpet is used for indoor play, with hardwood flooring having been historically used. [[Artificial turf]] courts can also be found.

==== Lines ====
The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines; they are the boundaries for doubles matches. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines, and are the boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve.&lt;ref name="ITF Court rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf|title=ITF Rules of Tennis&amp;nbsp;– Rule 1 (The Court)|publisher=ITF|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line dividing the service line in two is called the center line or center service line. The boxes this center line creates are called the service boxes; depending on a player's position, they have to hit the ball into one of these when serving.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf|title=ITF Rules of Tennis&amp;nbsp;– Rule 17 (Serving)|publisher=ITF|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ball is out only if none of it has hit the area inside the lines, or the line, upon its first bounce. All lines are required to be between {{convert|1|and|2|in|mm}} in width, with the exception of the baseline which can be up to {{convert|4|in|mm}} wide, although in practice it is often the same width as the others.&lt;ref name="ITF Court rules"/&gt;

=== Play of a single point ===
{{Main|Point (tennis)}}
The players or teams start on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated the ''server'', and the opposing player is the ''receiver''. The choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss before the warm-up starts. Service alternates game by game between the two players or teams. For each point, the server starts behind the baseline, between the center mark and the sideline. The receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net. When the receiver is ready, the server will [[Serve (tennis)|serve]], although the receiver must play to the pace of the server.

For a service to be legal, the ball must travel over the net without touching it into the diagonally opposite service box. If the ball hits the net but lands in the service box, this is a ''let'' or ''net service'', which is void, and the server retakes that serve. The player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults. A fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box, or does not clear the net. There is also a "foot fault" when a player's foot touches the baseline or an extension of the center mark before the ball is hit. If the second service, after a fault, is also a fault, the server ''double faults,'' and the receiver wins the point. However, if the serve is in, it is considered a legal service.

A legal service starts a ''rally'', in which the players alternate hitting the ball across the net. A legal return consists of a player hitting the ball so that it falls in the server's court, before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel over the net into the other players' court. A ball that hits the net during a rally is considered a legal return as long as it crosses into the opposite side of the court. The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point.&lt;ref name=Terminology&gt;{{cite news|title=Tennis Terminology |publisher=cbs.com |accessdate=31 December 2011|quote=|url=http://www.cbssports.com/tennis/story/6145343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scoring ===
{{Main|Tennis scoring system}}
{{redirect|Break point|software term|Breakpoint}}

==== Game, set, match ====
===== Game =====
A [[Tennis score#Game score|game]] consists of a sequence of [[Point (tennis)|points]] played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as "''love''", "''15''", "''30''", and "''40''", respectively. If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player's scores equal at 40 apiece, the score is not called out as "40–40", but rather as "''deuce''". If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "''advantage''" for the player in the lead. During informal games, "''advantage''" can also be called "''ad in''" or "''van in''" when the serving player is ahead, and "''ad out''" or "''van out''" when the receiving player is ahead; alternatively, either player may simply call out "''my ad''" or "''your ad''" during informal play.
[[File:Final Score Andy Roddick vs Saulnier.jpg|thumb|The scoreboard of a match between [[Andy Roddick]] and [[Cyril Saulnier]].]]
The score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving player's score first. In tournament play, the chair umpire calls the point count (e.g., "''15-love''") after each point. At the end of a game, the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score.

===== Set =====
A [[Tennis score#Set score|set]] consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played. If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins the game (tying the set 6–6) a ''[[Tiebreak (tennis)|tie-break]]'' is played. A tie-break, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7–6. A "love" set means that the loser of the set won zero games, colloquially termed a 'jam donut' in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATP Most Jam Donuts Served|url=http://www.tennis.com/stats/men_6-0.aspx|publisher=Tennis.com|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. The final score in sets is always read with the winning player's score first, e.g. "6–2, 4–6, 6–0, 7–5".

A [[Tennis score#Match score|match]] consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined through a best of three or five ''sets'' system. On the professional circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches at all four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the [[Olympic Games]] and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments. The first player to win two sets in a best-of-three, or three sets in a best-of-five, wins the match.&lt;ref&gt;From 1984 through 1998, women played first-to-win-three-sets in the final of the year-ending [[WTA Tour Championships]].&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the final sets of matches at the [[French Open]], the Olympic Games, and [[Fed Cup]] are tie-breaks not played. In these cases, sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead, occasionally leading to some [[Longest tennis match records|remarkably long matches]].

In tournament play, the chair [[Referee|umpire]] announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase "''Game, set, match''" followed by the winning person's or team's name.

==== Special point terms ====
===== Game point =====
{{anchor|game point|set point|match point|championship point}}A ''game point'' occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game. The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40-love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game. Game points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.

===== Break point =====
A ''break point'' occurs if the receiver, not the [[Serve (tennis)|server]], has a chance to win the game with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because [[Serve (tennis)|serving]] is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 30–40 or advantage), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has ''break point'', ''double break point'' or ''triple break point'', respectively. If the receiver does, in fact, win their break point, the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have ''converted'' their break point. If the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a ''failure to convert.'' Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as ''breaking serve'', as the receiver has disrupted, or ''broken'' the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as ''breaking back''. Except where [[Tennis score#Scoring a tiebreak game|tie-breaks]] apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set (otherwise a two-game lead would never occur).

=== Rule variations ===
{{See also|Types of tennis match}}

* '''No ad'''
: From 'No advantage'. Scoring method created by [[Jimmy Van Alen]]. The first player or doubles team to win four points wins the game, regardless of whether the player or team is ahead by two points. When the game score reaches three points each, the receiver chooses which side of the court (advantage court or deuce court) the service is to be delivered on the seventh and game-deciding point. Utilized by [[World Team Tennis]] professional competition, ATP tours, WTA tours, ITF Pro Doubles and ITF Junior Doubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTT Firsts &amp; Innovations|url=http://www.wtt.com/page.aspx?article_id=626|publisher=WTT.com|accessdate=3 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225082726/http://www.wtt.com/page.aspx?article_id=626|archivedate=25 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Procedures and Scoring Methods|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/equipment/appendixiv.asp|publisher=ITF|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Pro set'''
: Instead of playing multiple sets, players may play one "pro set". A pro set is first to 8 (or 10) games by a margin of two games, instead of first to 6 games. A 12-point tie-break is usually played when the score is 8–8 (or 10–10). These are often played with no-ad scoring.

* '''Match tie-break'''
: This is sometimes played instead of a third set. A match tie-break (also called ''super tie-break'') is played like a regular tie-break, but the winner must win ten points instead of seven. Match tie-breaks are used in the [[Hopman Cup]], Grand Slams (excluding [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]) and the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] for mixed doubles; on the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] (since 2006), [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] (since 2007) and [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] (excluding four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments and the [[Davis Cup]]) tours for doubles and as a player's choice in USTA league play.

* '''Fast4'''
: [[Fast4 Tennis|Fast4]] is a shortened format that offers a "fast" alternative, with four points, four games and four rules: there are no advantage scores, lets are played, tie-breakers apply at three games all and the first to four games wins the set.

Another, however informal, tennis format is called [[Canadian doubles]]. This involves three players, with one person playing against a doubles team. The single player gets to utilize the alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team. Conversely, the doubles team does not use the alleys when executing a shot. The scoring is the same as for a regular game. This format is not sanctioned by any official body.

"Australian doubles", another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, is played with similar rules to the [[Canadian doubles]] style, only in this version, players rotate court position after each game, each player taking a turn at playing alone against the other two. As such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving. Scoring styles vary, but one popular method is to assign a value of 2 points to each game, with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve and the doubles team each taking one if they break serve.

[[Wheelchair tennis]] can be played by able-bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility. An extra bounce is permitted. This rule makes it possible to have mixed wheelchair and able-bodied matches. It is possible for a doubles team to consist of a wheelchair player and an able-bodied player (referred to as "one-up, one-down"), or for a wheelchair player to play against an able-bodied player. In such cases, the extra bounce is permitted for the wheelchair users only.

== Officials ==
[[File:Tennis umpire.jpg|thumb|An [[Referee|umpire]] informing two players of the rules]]
{{Main|Official (tennis)}}

In most professional play and some amateur competition, there is an officiating head judge or chair [[Referee|umpire]] (usually referred to simply as the umpire), who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court. The umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations. The umpire may be assisted by line judges, who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults. There also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service. The umpire has the right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if the umpire is sure that a clear mistake has been made.&lt;ref name=officials&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf|title=ITF Rules of Tennis&amp;nbsp;– Appendix V (Role of Court Officials)|publisher=ITF|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In past tournaments, line judges tasked with calling the serve were sometimes assisted by [[Electronic line judge|electronic sensors]] that beeped to indicate an out-of-bounds serve; one such system was called "[[Cyclops (computer system)|Cyclops]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyclops and speed guns|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/tennis/features/newsid_3001000/3001768.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2012|date=20 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclops has since largely been replaced by the [[Hawk-Eye]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cyclops knocked off centre as Wimbledon adopts Hawkeye |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/24/tennis |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=6 May 2012 |date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hawk-eye Vision |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/27/tennis-hawk-eye?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=6 May 2012 |first=Richard |last=Evans|date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In professional tournaments using this system, players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one additional appeal in the tie-break to challenge close [[line call]]s by means of an [[instant replay|electronic review]]. The [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], [[Miami Masters]], [[United States Open Series|US Open Series]], and [[World Team Tennis]] started using this challenge system in 2006 and the [[Australian Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] introduced the system in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History Of Hawk-Eye|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/page/OffCourtNews/Read/0,,12781~2475719,00.html|publisher=WTA Tour|accessdate=6 September 2012|date=7 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124064901/http://www.wtatennis.com/page/OffCourtNews/Read/0,,12781~2475719,00.html|archive-date=24 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In clay-court matches, such as at the [[French Open]], a call may be questioned by reference to the mark left by the ball's impact on the court surface.

The referee, who is usually located off the court, is the final authority about tennis rules. When called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire's decision on a question of fact. If, however, the referee is on the court during play, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision. (This would only happen in Davis Cup or Fed Cup matches, not at the World Group level, when a chair umpire from a non-neutral country is in the chair).&lt;ref name=officials/&gt;

[[Ball boy|Ball boys and girls]] may be employed to retrieve balls, pass them to the players, and hand players their towels. They have no [[adjudicative]] role. In rare events (e.g., if they are hurt or if they have caused a hindrance), the umpire may ask them for a statement of what actually happened. The umpire may consider their statements when making a decision. In some leagues, especially junior leagues, players make their own calls, trusting each other to be honest. This is the case for many school and university level matches. The referee or referee's assistant, however, can be called on court at a player's request, and the referee or assistant may change a player's call. In unofficiated matches, a ball is out only if the player entitled to make the call is sure that the ball is out.

== Junior tennis ==
{{Main|Junior tennis}}

In tennis, a junior is a player under 18 who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian. Players on the main adult tour who are under 18 must have documents signed by a parent or guardian. These players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments.

The [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and an [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) or [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) ranking. Most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through ITF, Satellite, Future, and Challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit. The latter three circuits also have adults competing in them. Some juniors, however, such as Australian [[Lleyton Hewitt]] and Frenchman [[Gaël Monfils]], have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the ATP tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments.

In 2004, the ITF implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles, by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Announce Combined Junior Rankings|url=http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_1693_original.PDF|publisher=ITF|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Junior tournaments do not offer [[prize money]] except for the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam tournaments]], which are the most prestigious junior events. Juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the Future, Satellite, or Challenger tours. Tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points, culminating with Grade A.

Leading juniors are allowed to participate for their nation in the [[Junior Davis Cup and Junior Fed Cup|Junior Fed Cup and Davis Cup]] competitions. To succeed in tennis often means having to begin playing at a young age. To facilitate and nurture a junior's growth in tennis, almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system. Juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces, accommodating all different standards of play. Talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions.

== Match play ==
[[File:Tennis shake hands after match.jpg|left|thumb|Convention dictates that two players [[Handshake|shake hands]] at the end of a match]]

=== Continuity ===
A tennis match is intended to be continuous.&lt;ref name=ITF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_30333_original.PDF|title=The ITF states this in Rule No. 29|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because stamina is a relevant factor, arbitrary delays are not permitted. In most cases, service is required to occur no more than 20 seconds after the end of the previous point.&lt;ref name=ITF/&gt; This is increased to 90 seconds when the players change ends (after every odd-numbered game), and a 2-minute break is permitted between sets.&lt;ref name=ITF/&gt; Other than this, breaks are permitted only when forced by events beyond the players' control, such as rain, damaged footwear, damaged racket, or the need to retrieve an errant ball. Should a player be deemed to be stalling repeatedly, the chair umpire may initially give a warning followed by subsequent penalties of "point", "game", and default of the match for the player who is consistently taking longer than the allowed time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/109832/109832.pdf|publisher=ITF|title=Code of Conduct for 2012 ITF Pro Circuits Tournaments|quote=The first violation of this Section shall be penalised by a Time Violation warning and each subsequent violation shall be penalised by the assessment of one Time Violation point penalty.|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of a rain delay, darkness or other external conditions halting play, the match is resumed at a later time, with the same score as at the time of the delay, and each player at the same end of the court as when rain halted play, or as close to the same relative compass point if play is resumed on a different court.

=== Ball changes ===
Balls wear out quickly in serious play and, therefore, in [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournaments, they are changed after every nine games with the first change occurring after only seven games, because the first set of balls is also used for the pre-match warm-up.&lt;ref name=ball/&gt; In [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] tournaments like [[Fed Cup]], the balls are changed after every eleven games (rather than nine) with the first change occurring after only nine games (instead of seven). An exception is that a ball change may not take place at the beginning of a tiebreaker, in which case the ball change is delayed until the beginning of the second game of the next set.&lt;ref name="ITF Rules" /&gt; As a courtesy to the receiver, the server will often signal to the receiver before the first serve of the game in which new balls are used as a reminder that they are using new balls. Continuity of the balls' condition is considered part of the game, so if a re-warm-up is required after an extended break in play (usually due to rain), then the re-warm-up is done using a separate set of balls, and use of the match balls is resumed only when play resumes.

=== On-court coaching ===
A recent rule change is to allow coaching on court on a limited basis during a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expert-tennis-tips.com/tennis-on-court-coaching.html |publisher=Expert-tennis-tips.com|title=Tennis On-Court Coaching}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usta.com/USTA/Global/Improve_Your_Game/Archive/Tennis_Tips/Rules_and_Line_Calls/Coaching_during_a_match.aspx|publisher=USTA|title=Coaching during a match|accessdate=7 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505073501/http://www.usta.com/USTA/Global/Improve_Your_Game/Archive/Tennis_Tips/Rules_and_Line_Calls/Coaching_during_a_match.aspx|archive-date=5 May 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5441281 |title=Tennis Coaching Debate |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2620446 |title=Does on-court coaching have a future? |publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been introduced in women's tennis for [[WTA Tour]] events in 2009 and allows the player to request her coach once per set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/SEWTATour-Archive/Archive/AboutTheTour/rules.pdf WTA 2012 Official Rulebook] Chapter XVII/H&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stance ==
Stance refers to the way a player prepares themselves in order to best be able to return a shot. Essentially, it enables them to move quickly in order to achieve a particular stroke. There are four main stances in modern tennis: open, semi-open, closed, and neutral. All four stances involve the player crouching in some manner: as well as being a more efficient striking posture, it allows them to [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometrically preload]] their muscles in order to play the stroke more dynamically. What stance is selected is strongly influenced by shot selection. A player may quickly alter their stance depending on the circumstances and the type of shot they intend to play. Any given stance also alters dramatically based upon the actual playing of the shot with dynamic movements and shifts of body weight occurring.&lt;ref name="Tennis Stances"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.optimumtennis.net/tennis-stances.htm |title=Tennis Stances |access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tennis Techniques for Beginners"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.optimumtennis.net/tennis-techniques-for-beginners.htm |title=Tennis Techniques for Beginners |access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open stance ===
This is the most common stance in tennis. The player’s feet are placed parallel to the net. They may be pointing sideways, directly at the net or diagonally towards it. This stance allows for a high degree of torso rotation which can add significant power to the stroke. This process is sometimes likened to the coiling and uncoiling of a spring. i.e the torso is rotated as a means of preloading the muscular system in preparation for playing the stroke: this is the coiling phase. When the stroke is played the torso rotates to face forwards again, called uncoiling, and adds significant power to the stroke. A disadvantage of this stance is that it does not always allow ‘for proper weight transfer and maintenance of balance’&lt;ref name="Tennis Stances"/&gt; when making powerful strokes. It is commonly used for forehand strokes; double-handed backhands can also be made effectively from it.

=== Semi-open stance ===
This stance is somewhere between open and closed and is a very flexible stance. The feet are aligned diagonally towards the net. It allows for a lot of shoulder rotation and the torso can be coiled, before being uncoiled into the shot in order to increase the power of the shot. It is commonly used in modern tennis especially by ‘top professional players on the forehand’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.optimumtennis.net/tennis-stances.htm |title=Tennis Stances |access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-handed backhands can also be employed from this stance.

=== Closed stance ===
The closed stance is the least commonly used of the three main stances. One foot is placed further towards the net with the other foot further from it; there is a diagonal alignment between the feet.  It allows for effective torso rotation in order to increase the power of the shot. It is usually used to play backhand shots and it is rare to see forehand shots played from it. A stroke from this stance may entail the rear foot coming completely off the floor with bodyweight being transferred entirely to the front foot.&lt;ref name="Tennis Stances"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="Tennis Techniques for Beginners"/&gt;

=== Neutral stance ===
This is sometimes also referred to as the square stance. One foot is positioned closer to the net and ahead of the other which is  behind and in line with it. Both feet are aligned at a 90 degree angle to the net. The neutral stance is often taught early because ‘It allows beginners to learn about shifting weight and rotation of the body.’&lt;ref name="Tennis Techniques for Beginners"/&gt; Forehands and backhands may be made from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://woooiii.com/tennis-footwork-different-hitting-stances-explained/ |title=Tennis Footwork: Different Hitting Stances Explained |date=March 27, 2019 |access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shots ==
{{Main|Tennis shots}}
A competent tennis player has eight basic shots in his or her repertoire: the serve, forehand, backhand, volley, half-volley, overhead smash, drop shot, and lob.

=== Grip ===
{{Main|Grip (Tennis)}}
A grip is a way of holding the racket in order to hit shots during a match. The grip affects the angle of the racket face when it hits the ball and influences the pace, spin, and placement of the shot. Players use various grips during play, including the Continental (The "Handshake Grip"), Eastern (Can be either semi-eastern or full eastern. Usually used for backhands.), and Western (semi-western or full western, usually for forehand grips) grips. Most players change grips during a match depending on what shot they are hitting; for example, slice shots and serves call for a Continental grip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grip Guide&amp;nbsp;— A Grip on Your Game|url=http://www.tennis.com/articles/templates/instruction.aspx?articleid=1337|publisher=Tennis.com|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Serve ===
{{Main|Serve (tennis)}}
[[File:Paraguay stamp - Martina Navrátilová.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Paraguayan stamp depicting a [[Martina Navratilova]] service motion.]]
A serve (or, more formally, a "service") in tennis is a shot to start a point. The serve is initiated by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chang refused to lose 20 years ago|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french09/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&amp;id=4173388|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a "let" and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in. There can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isn't prepared.&lt;ref name="ITF Rules" /&gt; If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve, then they get one more try to get the serve in the box.

Experienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement. The server may employ different types of serve including flat serve, topspin serve, slice serve, and kick (American twist) serve. A reverse type of spin serve is hit in a manner that spins the ball opposite the natural spin of the server, the spin direction depending upon right- or left-handedness. If the ball is spinning counterclockwise, it will curve right from the hitter's point of view and curve left if spinning clockwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/skills/4229090.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2012|date=12 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; however, advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve. A winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an "ace".

=== Forehand ===
{{Main|Forehand}}
For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body. There are various [[Grip (tennis)|grips]] for executing the forehand, and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the ''continental'', the ''eastern'', the ''semi-western'', and the ''western''. For a number of years, the small, frail 1920s player [[Bill Johnston (tennis)|Bill Johnston]] was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a ''western'' grip. Few top players used the ''western'' grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the ''western'' forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racket, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s, the Ecuadorian/American player [[Pancho Segura]] used a two-handed forehand to achieve a devastating effect against larger, more powerful players. Players such as [[Monica Seles]] or France's [[Fabrice Santoro]] and [[Marion Bartoli]] are also notable players known for their two-handed forehands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two-handed Forehand Revisited|url=http://www.tennisone.com/magazine/iwells/07/smith/2-fh/2fh.php|publisher=TennisONE|accessdate=6 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511130748/http://www.tennisone.com/magazine/iwells/07/smith/2-fh/2fh.php|archive-date=11 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Backhand ===
{{Main|Backhand}}
[[File:Canada 2010 Andy Murray Backhand.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Andy Murray]] hitting a two-handed backhand.]]
For right-handed players, the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body, continues across their body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of their body. It can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. For most of the 20th century, the backhand was performed with one hand, using either an ''eastern'' or a ''continental'' grip. The first notable players to use two hands were the 1930s Australians [[Vivian McGrath]] and [[John Bromwich]], but they were lonely exceptions. The two-handed grip gained popularity in the 1970s as [[Björn Borg]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Jimmy Connors]], and later [[Mats Wilander]] and [[Marat Safin]] used it to great effect, and it is now used by a large number of the world's best players, including [[Rafael Nadal]] and [[Serena Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two-Handed is Superior to One-Handed Backhand|url=http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_27759_original.PDF|publisher=ITF|accessdate=6 May 2012|author=Damir Popadic|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two hands give the player more control, while one hand can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. Reach is also limited with the two-handed shot. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, [[Don Budge]], had a powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted topspin onto the ball. [[Ken Rosewall]], another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a very accurate slice backhand through the 1950s and 1960s. A small number of players, notably [[Monica Seles]], use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.

=== Other shots ===
A ''[[volley (tennis)|volley]]'' is a shot returned to the opponent in mid-air before the ball bounces, generally performed near the net, and is usually made with a stiff-wristed punching motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponent's court. The ''[[half volley]]'' is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, also generally in the vicinity of the net, and played with the racket close to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grasso|first=John|title=Historical Dictionary of Tennis|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-7237-0|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''swinging volley'' is hit out of the air as the player approaches the net. It is an offensive shot used to take preparation time away from the opponent, as it returns the ball into the opponent's court much faster than a standard volley.

From a poor defensive position on the baseline, the ''[[lob (tennis)|lob]]'' can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon, hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent's head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, an opponent near the net may then hit an ''[[smash (tennis)|overhead smash]]'', a hard, serve-like shot, to try to end the point.

A difficult shot in tennis is the return of an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player. When the contact point is higher than the reach of a two-handed backhand, most players will try to execute a high slice (under the ball or sideways). Fewer players attempt the backhand sky-hook or smash. Rarely, a player will go for a high topspin backhand, while themselves in the air. A successful execution of any of these alternatives requires balance and timing, with less margin of error than the lower contact point backhands, since this shot is a break in the regular pattern of play.

If an opponent is deep in his court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected ''[[drop shot]]'', by softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it. Advanced players will often apply back spin to a drop shot, causing the ball to "skid" upon landing and bounce sideways, with less forward momentum toward their opponent, or even backwards towards the net, thus making it even more difficult to return.

== Injuries ==
{{Main|Tennis injuries}}
Muscle strain is one of the most common injuries in tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Epidemiology of musculoskeletal injury in the tennis player|url = http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/46/7/492|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|date = 1 June 2012|issn =  1473-0480|pmid = 22554841|pages = 492–498|volume = 46|issue = 7|doi = 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091164|first = Geoffrey D.|last = Abrams|first2 = Per A.|last2 = Renstrom|first3 = Marc R.|last3 = Safran}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an isolated large-energy appears during the muscle contraction and at the same time body weight apply huge amount of pressure to the lengthened muscle, [[muscle strain]] can occur.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Joint structure and function: A comprehensive analysis (5th ed.).|last = Levangie, P.

[[List of muscles of the human body|Muscle]], [[cartilage]], [[nerves]], [[Knee bursae|bursae]], [[ligaments]] and [[tendons]] may be damaged from overuse. The repetitive use of a particular muscle without time for repair and recovery is the most common cause of injury.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Tournaments ==
{{See also|List of tennis tournaments}}
[[File:Centre Court.jpg|thumb|right|A tennis match at Centre Court in the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in [[2007 Wimbledon Championship|2007]]]]
Tournaments are often organized by gender and number of players. Common tournament configurations include men's singles, women's singles, and doubles, where two players play on each side of the net. Tournaments may be organized for specific age groups, with upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players. Example of this include the [[Dunlop Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] and [[Les Petits As]] junior tournaments. There are also tournaments for players with disabilities, such as [[wheelchair tennis]] and deaf tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lta.org.uk/PlayAndCompete/DisabilityTennis/DisabilityTennisHearing.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205021146/http://www.lta.org.uk/PlayAndCompete/DisabilityTennis/DisabilityTennisHearing.htm|archivedate=5 February 2008|title=Lawn Tennis Association Deaf tennis|accessdate=16 March 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments, the singles draws are limited to 128 players for each gender.

Most large tournaments [[Seed (sports)|seed]] players, but players may also be matched by their skill level. According to how well a person does in sanctioned play, a player is given a rating that is adjusted periodically to maintain competitive matches. For example, the [[United States Tennis Association]] administers the National Tennis Rating Program ([[United States Tennis Association#NTRP Ratings|NTRP]]), which rates players between 1.0 and 7.0 in 1/2 point increments. Average club players under this system would rate 3.0–4.5 while world class players would be 7.0 on this scale.

=== Grand Slam tournaments ===
The four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments are considered to be the most prestigious tennis events in the world. They are held annually and comprise, in chronological order, the [[Australian Open]], the [[French Open]], [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Apart from the [[Olympic Games]], [[Davis Cup]], [[Fed Cup]], and [[Hopman Cup]], they are the only tournaments regulated by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF).&lt;ref name=Slams&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/about/grand-slams/overview.aspx|publisher=ITF|title=Grand Slams Overview|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITF's national associations, [[Tennis Australia]] (Australian Open), the [[Fédération Française de Tennis]] (French Open), the [[Lawn Tennis Association]] (Wimbledon) and the [[United States Tennis Association]] (US Open) are delegated the responsibility to organize these events.&lt;ref name=Slams/&gt;

Aside from the historical significance of these events, they also carry larger prize funds than any other tour event and are worth double the number of ranking points to the champion than in the next echelon of tournaments, the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|Masters 1000]] (men) and [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier events]] (women).&lt;ref name=Rankings&gt;{{cite web|title=ATP Rankings FAQ|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx|publisher=ATP|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/includes/TrackIt.asp?file=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/Pdfs/rankings/howitworks.pdf|title=WTA Tour Rankings|accessdate=16 March 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119124913/http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/includes/TrackIt.asp?file=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonyericssonwtatour.com%2F3%2Fglobal%2FPdfs%2Frankings%2Fhowitworks.pdf|archivedate=19 January 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinguishing feature is the number of players in the singles draw. There are 128, more than any other professional tennis tournament. This draw is composed of 32 seeded players, other players ranked in the world's top 100, qualifiers, and players who receive invitations through [[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]]. Grand Slam men's tournaments have best-of-five set matches while the women play best-of-three. Grand Slam tournaments are among the small number of events that last two weeks, the others being the [[BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells Masters]] and the [[Sony Ericsson Open|Miami Masters]].

Currently, the Grand Slam tournaments are the only tour events that have [[Types of tennis match|mixed doubles]] contests. Grand Slam tournaments are held in conjunction with wheelchair tennis tournaments and [[junior tennis]] competitions. These tournaments also contain their own idiosyncrasies. For example, players at Wimbledon are required to wear predominantly white. [[Andre Agassi]] chose to skip Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 citing the event's traditionalism, particularly its "predominantly white" dress code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4088298.stm | title = What not to wear at Wimbledon | work = [[BBC Sport]] |author = Sarah Holt | date = 15 June 2005 | accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wimbledon has its own particular methods for disseminating tickets, often leading tennis fans to follow complex procedures to obtain tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wimbledondebentureholders.com/articles/ten_ways_to_grab_a_seat_at_wimbledon |title=10 Ways to Grab a Seat at Wimbledon 2010 |publisher=Wimbledondebentureholders.com |accessdate=24 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615193839/http://www.wimbledondebentureholders.com/articles/ten_ways_to_grab_a_seat_at_wimbledon |archive-date=15 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;* The international tournament began in 1925&lt;/small&gt;

=== Men's tournament structure ===
==== Masters 1000 ====
The [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] is a group of nine tournaments that form the second-highest echelon in men's tennis. Each event is held annually, and a win at one of these events is worth 1000 ranking points. When the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]], led by [[Hamilton Jordan]], began running the men's tour in 1990, the directors designated the top nine tournaments, outside of the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] events, as "Super 9" events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/abouttheitf/worldwide/history.asp|title=History of Tennis|accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 this became the Tennis Masters Series and in 2004 the [[ATP Masters Series]]. In November at the end of the tennis year, the world's top eight players compete in the [[ATP World Tour Finals]], a tournament with a rotating locale. It is currently held in [[London, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6264650.stm | title = London to host World Tour Final | publisher = [[BBC Sport]], Piers Newbery | date = 3 July 2007 | accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007 the ATP announced major changes to the tour that were introduced in 2009. The Masters Series was renamed to the "Masters 1000", the addition of the number 1000 referring to the number of ranking points earned by the winner of each tournament. Contrary to earlier plans, the number of tournaments was not reduced from nine to eight and the [[Monte Carlo Masters]] remains part of the series although, unlike the other events, it does not have a mandatory player commitment. The [[Hamburg Masters]] has been downgraded to a 500-point event. The [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Madrid Masters]] moved to May and onto clay courts, and a new tournament in [[Shanghai]] took over Madrid's former indoor October slot. As of 2011 six of the nine "1000" level tournaments are combined ATP and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coretennis.net/majic/pageServer/0p0100006b/en/ATP-Tour-2009.html |title=ATP Tour 2009 |publisher=Coretennis.net |date= |accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and fourth tier of men's tennis tournaments are formed by the [[ATP World Tour 500 series]], consisting of 11 tournaments, and the [[ATP World Tour 250 series]] with 40 tournaments.&lt;ref name=season&gt;{{cite web|title=ATP World Tour Season|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tournaments/Tournament-Landing.aspx|publisher=ATP|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]], these events offer various amounts of prize money and the numbers refer to the amount of ranking points earned by the winner of a tournament.&lt;ref name=Rankings/&gt; The [[Dubai Tennis Championships]] offer the largest financial incentive to players, with total prize money of [[US$]]2,313,975 (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Tournaments/Dubai.aspx|publisher=ATP|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These series have various draws of 28, 32, 48 and 56 for singles and 16 and 24 for doubles. It is mandatory for leading players to enter at least four 500 events, including at least one after the US Open.

==== Challenger Tour and Futures tournaments ====
The [[ATP Challenger Tour|Challenger Tour]] for men is the lowest level of tournament administered by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]]. It is composed of about 150 events and, as a result, features a more diverse range of countries hosting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tournaments/Challenger/ABOUT.aspx | title = About the Challenger Circuit | publisher = [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] | accessdate = 2 May 2012 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100227095535/http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tournaments/Challenger/ABOUT.aspx | archivedate = 27 February 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of players use the Challenger Series at the beginning of their career to work their way up the rankings. [[Andre Agassi]], between winning Grand Slam tournaments, plummeted to World No. 141 and used Challenger Series events for match experience and to progress back up the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon06/news/story?id=2506393 | title = An appreciation of Andre Agassi | publisher = [[ESPN]], Matt Wilansky | date = 1 July 2006 | accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Challenger Series offers prize funds of between [[US$]]25,000 and US$150,000.

Below the Challenger Tour are the Futures tournaments, events on the [[ITF Men's Circuit]]. These tournaments also contribute towards a player's [[ATP rankings]] points. Futures Tournaments offer prize funds of between US$10,000 and US$15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/mens/circuitinfo/index.asp|title=About the ITF Men's Circuit|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 530 Futures Tournaments are played each year.

=== Women's tournament structure ===
==== Premier events ====
[[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier]] events for women form the most prestigious level of events on the [[WTA Tour|Women's Tennis Association Tour]] after the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments. These events offer the largest rewards in terms of points and prize money. Within the Premier category are Premier Mandatory, Premier 5, and Premier tournaments. The Premier events were introduced in 2009 replacing the previous Tier I and II tournament categories. Currently four tournaments are Premier Mandatory, five tournaments are Premier 5, and twelve tournaments are Premier. The first tiering system in women's tennis was introduced in 1988. At the time of its creation, only two tournaments, the [[Lipton International Players Championships]] in [[Florida]] and the [[WTA German Open|German Open]] in Berlin, comprised the [[Tier I]] category.

==== International events ====
[[WTA International tournaments|International tournaments]] are the second main tier of the WTA tour and consist of 31 tournaments, with a prize money for every event at U.S.$220,000, except for the year-ending [[Commonwealth Bank Tournament of Champions]] in [[Bali]], which has prize money of U.S.$600,000.

== Players ==
=== Professional players ===
Professional tennis players enjoy the same relative perks as most top sports personalities: clothing, equipment and endorsements. Like players of other individual sports such as golf, they are not salaried, but must play and finish highly in tournaments to obtain prize money.

In recent years, some controversy has surrounded the involuntary or deliberate noise caused by players' [[Grunting (tennis)|grunting]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} 

====Singles and doubles professional careers====
While players are gradually less competitive in singles by their late 20s and early 30s, they can still continue competitively in doubles (as instanced by [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[John McEnroe]], who won doubles titles in their 40s).

In the Open Era, several female players such as [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Margaret Court]], [[Martina Hingis]], [[Serena Williams]], and [[Venus Williams]] (the latter two sisters playing together) have been prolific at both singles and doubles events throughout their careers. [[John McEnroe]] is one of the very few professional male players to be top ranked in both singles and doubles at the same time,&lt;ref name="nyt20000130"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.julianrubinstein.com/john.html |first=Julian |last=Rubinstein |title=Being John McEnroe |magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=January 30, 2000 |accessdate=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/john-mcenroe |title=John McEnroe |website=[[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=October 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029220802/http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/john-mcenroe |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6M0AEe3xA0C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=mcenroe+%22greatest+doubles%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4AjDPjAb5G&amp;sig=8NctZ15zDcc6PxzL9VmNJiD1E44&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EJRuUrvYM6f8iQKOmIH4Cg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mcenroe%20%22greatest%20doubles%22&amp;f=false |last=Cronin |first=Matthew |title=Epic: John McEnroe, Bjorn Borg, and the Greatest Tennis Season Ever |date=10 March 2011 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-01595-7 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] is the most recent male player to win multiple Grand Slams in both singles and doubles during the same period of his career.

In terms of public attention and earnings (see below), singles champions have far surpassed their doubles counterparts. The Open Era, particularly the men's side, has seen many top-ranked singles players that only sparingly compete in doubles, while having "doubles specialists" who are typically being eliminated early in the singles draw but do well in the doubles portion of a tournament. Notable doubles pairings include [[The Woodies]] ([[Todd Woodbridge]] and [[Mark Woodforde]]) and the [[Bryan Brothers]] (identical twin brothers [[Bob Bryan|Robert Charles "Bob" Bryan]] and [[Mike Bryan|Michael Carl "Mike" Bryan]]). Woodbridge has disliked the term "doubles ‘specialists’", saying that he and Woodforde "set a singles schedule and doubles fitted in around that", although later in Woodbridge's career he focused exclusively on doubles as his singles ranking fell too low that it was no longer financially viable to recover at that age. Woodbridge noted that while top singles players earn enough that they don't need to nor want to play doubles, he suggested that lower-ranked singles players outside the Top Ten should play doubles to earn more playing time and money.&lt;ref name="tennis.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2016/04/doubles-specialists-face-unusual-pressure-atmosphere-in-olympic-tennis/58267/|title=Doubles specialists face unusual pressure, atmosphere in Olympic tennis|website=Tennis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tennismash.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tennismash.com/2017/03/14/woodbridge-doubles-specialists-tennis-players/|title=Woodbridge: Doubles 'specialists' or tennis players?|date=14 March 2017|website=Tennismash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Olympics====
The Olympics doubles tennis tournament necessitates that both members of a doubles pairing be from the same country, hence several top professional pairs such as [[Jamie Murray]] and [[Bruno Soares]] cannot compete in the Olympics. Top-ranked singles players that are usually rivals on the professional circuit, such as [[Boris Becker]] and [[Michael Stich]], and [[Roger Federer]] and [[Stan Wawrinka]] have formed a rare doubles partnership for the Olympics. Unlike professional tennis tournaments (see below) where singles players receive much more prize money than doubles players, an Olympic medal for both singles and doubles has similar prestige. The Olympics is more of a priority for doubles champions while singles champions often skip the tournament.&lt;ref name="tennis.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tennismash.com"/&gt; While the ATP has voted for Olympic results to count towards player ranking points, WTA players voted against it.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-aug-06-sp-65453-story.html|title=Raymond Is Taking Issue With a Doubles Standard|date=6 August 2000|website=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2000 Olympics]], [[Lisa Raymond]] was passed over for Team USA in favor of [[Serena Williams]] by captain [[Billie Jean King]], even though Raymond was the top-ranked doubles player in the world at the time, and Raymond unsuccessfully challenged the selection.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;

====Prize money====
In professional tennis tournaments such as [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the singles competition receives the most prize money and coverage, followed by doubles, and then mixed doubles usually receive the lowest monetary awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wimbledon Prize Money|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/news?slug=ap-wimbledonprizemoneylist|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance in the [[US Open (tennis)#Prize money|US Open]] as of 2018, the men's and women's singles prize money (US$40,912,000) accounts for 80.9 percent of total player base compensation, while men's and women's doubles (US$6,140,840), men's and women's singles qualifying (US$3,008,000), and mixed doubles (US$505,000) account for 12.1 percent, 5.9 percent, and 1.0 percent, respectively. The singles winner receives US$3,800,000, while the doubles winning pair receives $700,000 and the mixed doubles winning pair receives US$155,000.&lt;ref name="Prize money"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usopen.org/en_US/visit/prize_money.html | title=2018 US Open Prize Money | publisher=[[United States Tennis Association]] | accessdate=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greatest male players ===
{{further|Tennis male players statistics|World number one male tennis player rankings}}

A frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time. By a large margin, an [[Associated Press]] poll in 1950 named [[Bill Tilden]] as the greatest player of the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016509.html|title=ESPN.com: Tilden brought theatrics to tennis|website=www.espn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1920 to 1930, Tilden won singles titles at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] three times and the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]] seven times. In 1938, however, [[Donald Budge]] became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]], and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge "the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.authentichistory.com/1930s/sports/1937_Don_Budge_on_Davis_Cup_SF_Win_Over_Von_Cramm.html | title=Don Budge's Comments After 1937 Davis Cup Semi-final Match Against Baron Gottfried von Cramm (1:07) | accessdate=29 May 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426051252/http://www.authentichistory.com/1930s/sports/1937_Don_Budge_on_Davis_Cup_SF_Win_Over_Von_Cramm.html | archivedate=26 April 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1979 autobiography, [[Jack Kramer]] said that, based on consistent play, Budge was the greatest player ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Game, My 40 Years in Tennis''|date=|year=1979|last1=Kramer|first1=Jack|last2=Deford|first2=Frank|isbn=0-399-12336-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers, however, also felt that Kramer deserved consideration for the title. Kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late 1940s and early 1950s. [[Tony Trabert]] has said that of the players he saw before the start of the [[Open Era]], Kramer was the best male champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sportsmediainc.net/tennisweek/index.cfm?func=showarticle&amp;newsid=10503&amp;bannerregion | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024737/http://www.sportsmediainc.net/tennisweek/index.cfm?func=showarticle&amp;newsid=10503&amp;bannerregion | archivedate=27 September 2007 | title=The Tennis Week Interview: Tony Trabert Part II | author=Richard Pagliaro | date=26 February 2004 | accessdate=29 May 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, Budge and others had added [[Pancho Gonzales]] and [[Lew Hoad]] to the list of contenders. Budge reportedly believed that Gonzales was the greatest player ever.&lt;ref&gt;Will Grimsley, ''Tennis: Its History, People, and Events'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzales said about Hoad, "When Lew's game was at its peak nobody could touch him.&amp;nbsp;... I think his game was the best game ever. Better than mine. He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesbuddell.com/files/hoad.pdf|title=Hoad|publisher=Jame Buddell|accessdate=28 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625042034/http://www.jamesbuddell.com/files/hoad.pdf|archive-date=25 June 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Roger Federer]] is considered by many observers to have the most "complete" game in modern tennis.

As with the men there are frequent discussions about who is the greatest female singles player of all time with [[Steffi Graf]], [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Serena Williams]] being the three players most often nominated.

In March 2012 the TennisChannel published a combined list of the 100 greatest men and women tennis players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Greatest of All Time|url=http://www.tennischannel.com/goat/71.aspx|publisher=The Tennis Channel|accessdate=3 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605022801/http://www.tennischannel.com/goat/71.aspx|archivedate=5 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ranked Steffi Graf as the greatest female player (in 3rd place overall), followed by [[Martina Navratilova]] (4th place) and [[Margaret Court]] (8th place). The rankings were determined by an international panel.
[[File:Serena Williams July 2008.jpg|upright|alt=Serena Williams July 2008|thumb|Serena Williams July 2008]]
Sportswriter John Wertheim of [[Sports Illustrated]] stated in an article in July 2010 that [[Serena Williams]] is the greatest female tennis player ever with the argument that "Head-to-head, on a neutral surface (i.e. hard courts), everyone at their best, I can't help feeling that she crushes the other legends.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=I said it: Serena Williams is game's greatest ever. |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/jon_wertheim/07/07/serena.mailbag/index.html |publisher=SI.com |accessdate=3 May 2012 |first=John |last=Wertheim |date=7 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824035739/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/jon_wertheim/07/07/serena.mailbag/index.html |archive-date=24 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a reaction to this article Yahoo sports blog Busted Racket published a list of the top-10 women's tennis players of all time placing Martina Navratilova in first spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranking the top-10 women's tennis players of all time|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/blog/busted_racquet/post/Ranking-the-top-10-women-s-tennis-players-of-all?urn=ten,256242|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This top-10 list was similar to the one published in June 2008 by the Bleacher Report who also ranked Martina Navratilova as the top female player of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greatest Ever: Tennis: The Top Ten Female Players of All Time|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/29251-greatest-ever-tennis-the-top-ten-female-players-of-all-time|website=Bleacher Report|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of tennis matches ===

[[Types of tennis match]]
* Standard matches &amp;ndash; are played in official tournaments and during casual play.
** Singles &amp;ndash; two players compete, usually two men or two women, although games between a man and a woman may be played on an informal basis.  Singles matches do not include the part of the tennis court called the ''alley''.
** Doubles  &amp;ndash; two teams of two players each, most often all-male or all-female. The two players on the receiving side change positions after each point played: one at the net and the other near the baseline preparing to return serve.  The full court is used in doubles matches, that is, the area in the ''alley'' is included.
** Mixed doubles  &amp;ndash; same as ''doubles'', but with one man and one woman on each team.
* Other informal matches
** [[Canadian doubles]] &amp;ndash; two players play against one player, where the duo can only hit the ball within the single player's singles lines. Often used for training, or when the single player is much better than the other two.

*** Baseline &amp;ndash; line marking the end of the court, at the back of the back court and the alleys.
*** Center line &amp;ndash; line dividing the two ''service boxes'' in the center of the court.
*** Center mark &amp;ndash; 12-inch mark at the halfway point of the baseline used to distinguish the right and left halves of a tennis court.

A match consists of best of three sets or, only on the men's side, the best of five in grand slams and Davis Cup play. Doubles matches are usually the best of three sets, with the third set being played in a match tie break form.
** [[Set (tennis)|Sets]] &amp;ndash; a maximum of 12 games, unless a player or team reach 6 or 7 games and are clear by two. If the set gets to 6-all then a tie breaker is played
*** [[Game (tennis)|Games]] &amp;ndash; which are the first to four points and clear by two, and a maximum of 12 games make up a set.
**** [[Tie break]] &amp;ndash; In regular play if the scores reach 6 all then a tie break is played. It is played to the first to seven points and must be won by at least two points. If not then play continues until one player is two points ahead.
***** [[Point (tennis)|Points]] &amp;ndash; Points are a passages of play which players win points to make a game. The scoring is based on a clock face. The scoring is fifteen, thirty, forty five (although this was shortened to forty to make it easier for the umpire) and game. However, if the players are tied at 40-all, otherwise known as deuce, then a player must win two points consecutively from deuce to win the game.

== Game play ==

=== Tennis moves ===

==== Tennis shots ====

[[Tennis shots]]
There are eight basic shots in the game of tennis:

# [[Serve (tennis)|Serve]] &amp;ndash; a shot to start a point. A player begins a serve by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the highest point of the toss) into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net.
#* [[Ace (tennis)|Ace]] &amp;ndash; a legal serve that is not touched by the receiver. Aces are usually powerful and generally land on or near one of the corners at the back of the service box.
# [[Forehand]] &amp;ndash;  shot made by swinging the racquet across one's body in the direction of where the player wants to place the shot. It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke.
# [[Backhand]] &amp;ndash;  shot in which one swings the racquet around one's body in the direction where one wants the ball to go, usually performed from the baseline or as an approach shot.  The backhand can be a one-handed or two-handed stroke.
# [[Volley (tennis)|Volley]] &amp;ndash;
# [[Half volley]] &amp;ndash; (pick-up ball)
# [[Smash (tennis)|Overhead smash]] &amp;ndash;
# [[Drop shot]] &amp;ndash;
# [[Lob (tennis)|Lob]] &amp;ndash;

=== Strategy and styles of play ===

[[Tennis strategy]]
Players are often described by their style of play:
* [[Offensive baseliner]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Pusher (tennis)|Defensive baseliner]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Serve-and-volley]]er &amp;ndash;
* [[All-court player]] &amp;ndash;

Doubles strategies include:

      <text bytes="9408" xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Wimbledonchair frontview.jpg|thumb|right|Australian Chair umpire Scott Ray positions himself prior to a match at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/682921/qualifications-galore-at-burnie-international/|title=Qualifications galore at Burnie International|last=HOPE|first=BB] nBURNIE INTERNATIONAL By CHLOE|date=2010-02-02|website=The Advocate|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] In [[tennis]], an '''official''' is a person who ensures that a match or tournament is conducted according to the [[International Tennis Federation]] Rules of Tennis and other competition regulations.&lt;ref name="Rules of Tennis 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf|title=Rules of Tennis 2012 - ITF|publisher=International Tennis Federation|accessdate=September 30, 2012|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the highest levels of the sport, a team of up to eleven officials may be on court at any given time.&lt;ref name="D+P"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/107082/107082.pdf|title=Duties and Procedures for Officials 2012 - ITF|publisher=International Tennis Federation|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These officials are broken up into categories based on their responsibility during the match. Contrastingly, many tennis matches are conducted with no officials present directly on court.

== Certification ==
Tennis officials are certified by their respective national association. The ITTF also certifies officials in the categories of chair umpire, referee and chief umpire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/abouttheitf/rulesregs/officiating.asp|title=ITF Officiating}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each ITTF certification or "badge" is broken into five certification levels. The first, green badge, is considered sufficient for officiating at the highest levels of tennis within the official's own nation and is not divided into categories (and is primarily used in Spanish- and French-speaking areas, where a national organization may not be present). The second, the white badge, is divided into the three categories (chair, chief, and referee) but remains only a national certification. The following three, bronze (chair umpire only), silver, and gold badge, are considered international certifications. These international officials are those seen at the highest levels of play like the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slams]], [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] Tours, and the [[Fed Cup|Fed]] and [[Davis Cup|Davis]] Cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dps.usta.com/usta_master/usta/doc/content/doc_13_15624.pdf|title=2007 ITF Officiating Structure|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chair umpire ==
The '''chair umpire''' is the final authority on all questions of fact during the match. Questions of fact include whether a ball was in, the calling of a service let or the calling of a foot-fault. In matches where line umpires are also assigned, the chair umpire has the right to overrule if he or she is sure that a clear mistake has been made.
The chair umpire is often situated in a tall chair at the center of the court, behind a net post. The players' benches are to either side of the chair. From this position, the chair umpire calls the score of the match to the players and spectators between points. At the conclusion of a point, game, or set, the chair umpire times the players to ensure they follow ITF regulations on pace of play. The chair umpire is responsible for completing a scorecard, the official historical record of the match.

== Line umpire ==
[[Image:Line umpire.jpg|thumb|right|A line umpire stands at ready position, focusing on his assigned line.]]
The '''line umpire''' "calls all shots relating to the assigned lines."&lt;ref&gt;USTA Regulation VI.F.1 from FAC&lt;/ref&gt; Line umpires work on court as part of a team of between one and nine line umpires. Each line umpire is assigned to one line or, in the case of a short-handed crew, a position in a system. For example, a line umpire on the receiver's side may have to cover the center service line then, following the serve, move to one of the sidelines.

The line umpire signals a ball out by making a verbal "out" call ("fault" for a serve) followed by the extension of the arm shoulder high in the direction the ball was out. A ball is signalled "safe" or "good" by holding both hands together knee high in front of the body.&lt;ref&gt;FAC Comment VI.F-1.2-3 from FAC&lt;/ref&gt; A line umpire who is unable to call a shot (usually because a player obstructs his/her view) signals this by holding his/her hands beside his/her head, the upper side pointing in the same direction as the eyes; that call is then the chair umpire's responsibility.  Line umpires are also responsible for calling footfaults.  When baseline umpires are being used, they watch to see if the server touches any part of the baseline before the ball is struck.  Center service line umpires are responsible for calling footfaults when the server steps over the imaginary extension of the centerline.  Footfault calls are made with a verbal "Footfault" call followed by a vertical extension of the arm with the palm open.

== Off-court officials==
=== Referee ===
The '''referee''' "is the official who is responsible for assuring that the competition is fair and played under the ITF Rules of Tennis." The referee supervises all of the aspects of play at a tournament including the conduct of players, coaches, spectators, and administrative crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Off Court Officials|url=http://www.itftennis.com/officiating/officiating-roles/off-court-officials.aspx|publisher=ITF|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The referee must be present whenever matches are being played.

The referee also "is the final authority on all questions of tennis law..."&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;Appendix V of [http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf The 2012 ITF Rules of Tennis]&lt;/ref&gt; Any player may appeal the chair umpire's interpretation of tennis law to the tournament referee or deputy referee. In making the decision on an appeal the referee must consider the rulings of fact of the chair umpire, as well as statements of the players and line umpires. The referee's decision is final.

The referee is also responsible for making the [[Bracket (tournament)|tournament draw]] in accordance with competition regulations. The making of the draw includes determining [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeds]] and placing players and [[Bye (sports)|byes]]. The referee must then work with tournament organizers to schedule matches. This process has been made much easier in recent years with the introduction of computer programs that complete draw sheets and schedules based on online player entries and court availability.

During play of a tournament, the referee is the sole authority on the suspension of play due to weather and other concerns.&lt;ref&gt;USTA Regulation III.B.8 from FAC&lt;/ref&gt;

The referee is usually only seen on court during the administration of a medical timeout. Due to the complex regulations dictating medical timeouts the referee accompanies the medical trainer onto court. The referee is present to explain procedures and regulations to the player and trainer, and to time the timeout to ensure no extra time is given, as this would be construed as an unfair advantage.

=== Chief umpire ===
The '''chief umpire''' of a tournament "appoints and replaces or reassigns, when necessary, Chair Umpires, (and) Line Umpires..."&lt;ref&gt;USTA Regulation VI.B from FAC&lt;/ref&gt; Chief umpires are used primarily in large professional tournaments and are responsible for the recruitment and hiring of officials for the tournament. During the tournament, the chief umpire assigns umpires to courts, subject to overrule by the referee. The chief umpire also collects scorecards from chair umpires at the conclusion of the match and thus may furnish the media with any factual information they may request.

The practice of '''doping in tennis''' involves the use of prohibited, performance-enhancing substances listed by the [[International Tennis Federation|International Tennis Federation (ITF)]] and [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/antidoping/rules/prohibited-list.aspx|title=Prohibited List}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is considered unsportsmanlike and unethical, with punishments for such offences ranging from official warnings to career bans, depending on the severity of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/players/2010/04/faq-drug-testing-and-doping-in-tennis/21954/|title=FAQ: Drug Testing and Doping In Tennis|work=Tennis.com|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread illegal substance abuse in tennis developed during the 1980s and 1990s as performance-enhancing substances became increasingly available in professional sport. The detection and punishment for the use of drugs in this period was aided by the takeover of policing drug cheating by the International Tennis Federation in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/antidoping/about-the-programme/history.aspx|title=History|website=ITF Tennis|access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Anti-doping policy within tennis primarily developed from the 1980s with the increased prevalence of recreational drugs and steroid use among athletes across various sporting professions.

According to the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF), the Men's Tennis Council began drug testing in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/antidoping/about-the-programme/history.aspx|title=History|date=2018|website=ITF Tennis|access-date=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug testing program that was administered by the Men's Tennis Council targeted recreational drugs such as [[cocaine]], [[methamphetamine]] and [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], before the creation of the ATP Tour in 1990 marked an official transition towards performance-enhancing drug regulation.

From 1993, the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA World Tour), [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP World Tour) and [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) led a combined anti-doping initiative in professional tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/antidoping/about-the-programme/history.aspx|title=History|website=ITF Tennis|access-date=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the joint initiative between the ATP and WTA, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) became the sole governing body for professional tennis anti-doping initiatives in 2007, as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP World Tour) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA World Tour) moved towards a player-focused organisation and administrative role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/antidoping/about-the-programme/history.aspx|title=History|website=ITF Tennis|access-date=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bodies that regulate doping within tennis on a national level include the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]].

== Doping in men's tennis ==
=== Andre Agassi (1997) ===
[[File:Andre Agassi Indian Wells 2006.jpg|thumb|Andre Agassi (2006)]]
In 1997, [[Andre Agassi]] returned a positive drug test for the use of [[methamphetamine]]. A joint investigation carried out by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) and [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] ([[ATP World Tour]]) handed down a three-month suspension from professional tennis for the incident. However, the punishment was not formally handed down after Agassi blamed the positive result on a spiked drink.

Agassi's case was revisited in 2009 following the publication of Agassi's autobiography, ''Open: An Autobiography'', where Agassi admitted to lying about the cause of his positive drug test result. Agassi admitted that he became addicted to [[methamphetamine]] during 1997 after his assistant introduced him to the drug and he faced both personal and professional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-agassi-drugs/andre-agassi-revelations-leave-sport-in-state-of-shock-idUSTRE59Q5IH20091028|title=Andre Agassi revelations leave sport in state of shock|last=Herman|first=Martyn|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the admission, no formal case has been opened against Agassi as the offence was committed prior to the establishment of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency|World-Anti Doping Agency]] in 1999 and the [[International Tennis Federation|International Tennis Federation's]] (ITF) formal takeover of the ATP World Tour's anti-doping program since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-agassi-drugs/andre-agassi-revelations-leave-sport-in-state-of-shock-idUSTRE59Q5IH20091028|title=Andre Agassi revelations leave sport in state of shock|last=Herman|first=Martyn|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Richard Gasquet (2009) ===
In 2009, [[Richard Gasquet]] returned a positive drug result for [[cocaine]] use. Gasquet denied intentional use of the drug, citing that he may have been exposed to the substance after kissing a female at a Miami nightclub (known in the media as "The Cocaine Kiss Controversy").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=4329491|title=Cocaine ban over, Gasquet cleared to return|date=2009-07-15|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Richard Gasquet (19049021379).jpg|thumb|Richard Gasquet (2015)]]The [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] were initially seeking a two-year ban because of the substance used in the incident. Due to the Gasquet's denial, and the small amount of cocaine detected, Gasquet initially received a one-year ban. However, this was overturned following an independent review that found the case was unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/dec/17/richard-gasquet-cocaine-cas-ban|title=Richard Gasquet escapes ban after CAS clears him over positive cocaine test|last=Nakrani|first=Sachin|date=2009-12-17|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITF and WADA challenged the ruling in the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] but were unsuccessful. 
Consequently, Gasquet received a formal six-week ban that came into effect in May 2009 to July 2009, which prevented him from competing in the [[French Open]] or [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. During this period his professional ranking fell nine places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=4329491|title=Cocaine ban over, Gasquet cleared to return|date=2009-07-15|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only punishment enforced by governing authorities, with no prize money fine or forfeiture of ranking being imposed. An independent tribunal ruled that Gasquet had not intentionally consumed the substance, that it was not performance-enhancing, and that he would have consumed the bare minimum amount to be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/05/tennis-richard-gasquet-drugs-ban|title=Cocaine kisses could come back to bite Richard Gasquet and ITF|last=Scott|first=Matt|date=2009-08-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] found Gasquet not guilty of a doping offence and he returned to professional tennis following the ban at the Australian Open in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/australianopen/7012778/Australian-Open-2010-Richard-Gasquet-glad-to-be-putting-cocaine-scandal-behind-him.html|title=Australian Open 2010: Richard Gasquet glad to be putting cocaine scandal behind him|last=Hodgkinson|first=Mark|date=2010|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marin Cilic (2013) ===
In 2013, [[Marin Čilić|Marin Cilic]] returned a positive drug test for the substance [[nikethamide]]. The drug is a widely used stimulant that effects respiratory function through the increase in blood flow and oxygen intake within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macarthur|first=J.

[[File:Marin Cilic (18697958020).jpg|thumb|Marin Cilic (2015)]]Cilic denied having deliberately taken the drug, stating that the substance was contained in [[glucose]] tablets that were purchased from a pharmacy while he was competing in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/sports/tennis/marin-cilic-suspended-for-nine-months-for-doping.html|title=Cilic Is Suspended Nine Months for Doping|last=Press|first=The Associated|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) recognised Cilic's claim and did not hand down the regular two-year professional ban for instances of illegal doping. Instead, he received a nine-month ban due to the low level of the drug that was detected and the contextual circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/09/18/13/cilic-appeal-doping-ban|title=Cilic to appeal doping ban|last=Reuters|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The initial ban would have prevented Cilic from competing in the [[2013 US Open (tennis)|2013 US Open]] and the [[2014 Australian Open]] with the suspension period extending from May 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/sports/tennis/marin-cilic-suspended-for-nine-months-for-doping.html|title=Cilic Is Suspended Nine Months for Doping|last=Press|first=The Associated|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a successful appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], Cilic's nine-month ban was reduced to four months, with a retrospective provisioning period recognising time already spent away from the game. The ruling also resulted in the return of Cilic's prize money and ATP World Tour points from the [[2013 French Open]], [[2013 Wimbledon Championships|2013 Wimbledon]] and [[2013 BMW Open]] where he tested positive to [[nikethamide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/10404579/Marin-Cilic-has-doping-ban-reduced-to-four-months-by-Court-of-Arbitration-for-Sport.html|title=Marin Cilic has doping ban reduced to four months by Court of Arbitration for Sport|last=Sport|first=Telegraph|date=2013-10-25|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victor Troicki, Boodles.jpg|thumb|Victor Troicki (2011)]]
In 2013, [[Viktor Troicki]] refused to partake in a mandatory blood test carried out by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF). As part of the 2013 anti-doping program administered by the governing body, it is compulsory that when requested by ITF staff, that players provide in and/or out-of-competition blood and urine testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/media/197083/197083.pdf|title=2013 Testing Summary|website=ITF Tennis|access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible for players to ask to be excused from such test, it is at the discretion of the ITF to postpone such tests.

Troicki stated he did not agree to the blood test as he was sick when the test was ordered by the ITF, however, he did provide the mandatory urine sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/23459655|title=Viktor Troicki banned for 18 months for doping violation|date=2013-07-26|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with his illness, Troicki also suffers from a [[Needle phobia|phobia of needles]] that makes such tests difficult to administer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/07/back-exile-viktor-troicki-returns-tennis/52185/|title=Back from Exile: Viktor Troicki Returns to Tennis|work=Tennis.com|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having refused Troicki's claim, the ITF handed down an 18-month ban due to the failure to comply with the organisations anti-doping regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/23459655|title=Viktor Troicki banned for 18 months for doping violation|date=2013-07-26|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial ban prevented Troicki from competing professionally on the ITF Challenger or ATP World Tour from 26 July 2013 until 24 January 2015, missing the [[2013 US Open (tennis)|2013 US Open]], all the 2014 Grand Slams and [[2015 Australian Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/25/viktor-troicki-banned-18-months|title=Viktor Troicki banned for 18 months for failing to provide blood sample|last=Association|first=Press|date=2013-07-25|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment also enforced the forfeiture of all ATP World Tour points and prize money received at the 2013 [[Monte-Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo Masters]] tennis tournament where he refused to participate in the blood test.

Troicki appealed the sentence to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] in October 2013 and was successful in having his ban reduced by 6 months from 18 to a total 12-month ban. The new sentence prevented Troicki from competing professionally from 26 July 2013 to 26 July 2014 with the sentence recognising time already spent suspended from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/07/back-exile-viktor-troicki-returns-tennis/52185/|title=BACK FROM EXILE: VIKTOR TROICKI RETURNS TO TENNIS|last=Cox|first=David|date=20 July 2014|website=Tennis.com|access-date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to tournaments on the International Tennis Federation's Challenger circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/07/back-exile-viktor-troicki-returns-tennis/52185/|title=BACK FROM EXILE: VIKTOR TROICKI RETURNS TO TENNIS|last=Cox|first=David|website=Tennis.com|access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hingis challenged the ruling, however, this was refused by the ITF as she had already announced a retirement from the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ubitennis.net/2017/10/martina-hingis-teenage-sensation-marred-doping-ban-turned-doubles-icon/|title=Martina Hingis: A Teenage Sensation Marred By A Doping Ban That Turned Into A Doubles Icon - UBITENNIS|website=www.ubitennis.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-23|date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2016, the drug was placed on the International Tennis Federation's banned substance list as it was ruled to have performance-enhancing effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-08/what-is-meldonium-and-what-does-it-do-to-your-body/7228670|title=What is meldonium and how does it affect the body?|date=2016-03-08|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such effects include increased blood circulation through the greater intake of oxygen that enables increased exercise ability and a reduced recovery period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/11/sports/tennis/effects-of-meldonium-on-athletes-are-hazy.html|title=Effects of Meldonium on Athletes Are Hazy|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report handed down by the [[International Tennis Federation]] and [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] found that while Sharapova may not have been consciously using the substance to increase performance, it is the responsibility of the player and team to be aware of new additions to the banned substance list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-09/tennis-maria-sharapova-banned-for-two-years-for-doping/7494786|title=Maria Sharapova banned for two years for failing drug test|date=2016-06-09|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Sharapova was initially issued a two-year ban by the ITF that prevented her from competing professionally on the WTA World Tour until 25 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-09/tennis-maria-sharapova-banned-for-two-years-for-doping/7494786|title=Maria Sharapova banned for two years for failing drug test|date=2016-06-09|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of banned substances ==
[[File:Rawdealsteroids4.jpg|thumb|Banned anabolic steroid canisters.]]The list of banned substances in tennis as it stands in 2018 has been published by the [[International Tennis Federation|International Tennis Federation (ITF)]]. The prohibited substance list is categorised into the following:

* '''[[Anabolic steroid|Anabolic agents:]]''' include the use of anabolic steroids that increase [[testosterone]] levels in players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/mentalhealth/Factsheets/Pages/anabolic.aspx|title=Anabolic Steroids - Fact sheets|website=www.health.nsw.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug is prohibited as it hastens the process of muscle growth in athletes and allows for limited recovery time post matches. A full list of itemised anabolic agents is listed on the ITF website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/antidoping/education/prohibited-substances/overview.aspx|title=Overview|website=ITF Tennis|access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Hormone and metabolic modulators:''' include drugs that effect the levels of [[oestrogen]] in both males and females. Such substances can prevent the conversion of [[testosterone]] into [[Estrogen|oestrogen]] and effect the levels of growth of these hormones in the human body. Due to the change on hormones, the use of these agents can also effect athletes [[metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.antidoping.ch/en/prevention/mobile-learning-programs/mobile-lesson-substances-and-methods/s4-hormone-and-metabolic|title=S4 Hormone and metabolic modulators|date=2014-03-28|work=Antidoping Switzerland|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tube with blood sample.jpg|thumb|Example of blood samples stored and later re-injected into players bodies to increase red blood cell levels.]]
In addition to the publication of an official list of banned substances, the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) has published a list of banned practices that are considered acts of illegal doping within tennis.

* '''[[Blood doping|Blood doping:]]''' includes the use of substances to increase [[red blood cell]] levels to regulate oxygen levels within the body, increasing athlete performance and recovery. Examples of [[blood doping]] include direct manipulation of the red blood cell count by injecting athletes with additional red blood cells and the retrieving and storing method that involves blood samples being collected, stored and then re-entered into the body once the cell count has returned to normal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/content/what-is-prohibited/prohibited-at-all-times/manipulation-of-blood-and-blood-components|title=What is Prohibited|website=World Anti-Doping Agency|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Doping (semiconductor)|Chemical doping:]]''' involves the manipulation of blood and drug samples provided by athletes and [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous injections]] except for acceptable hospital treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oly-dop-day1/substances-and-methods-used-in-doping-idUSBRE86R0DA20120728|title=Substances and methods used in doping|last=Kelland|first=Kate|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gene doping|Gene doping:]]''' is similar to blood doping in that additional genes are injected to an athletes body to increase performance.

While it is not recognised as a doping method, the un/intentional avoidance or missed drug test carried out by the ITF or other anti-doping body is also recognised as a type of doping offence. While the player may not have banned substances within their system, a missed test can result in a ban from professional competition of up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/06/29/serena-williams-pushes-back-in-strange-drug-testing-controversy/|title=Serena Williams pushes back in strange drug testing controversy|date=2018-06-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies surrounding anti-doping policy ==
Anti-doping policy remains controversial due to the large amount of substances, ingredients and chemicals that athletes are prohibited from being exposed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hon|first=Olivier de|last2=Coumans|first2=Bart|date=2007-11-01|title=The continuing story of nutritional supplements and doping infractions|url=https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/41/11/800|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|language=en|volume=41|issue=11|pages=800–805|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2007.037226|issn=0306-3674|pmc=2465258|pmid=17957017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy surrounds inadvertent cases of doping, such as those by [[Richard Gasquet]] (The Cocaine Kiss Controversy)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/usopen/6115999/US-Open-Richard-Gasquet-puts-Cocaine-Kiss-saga-behind-him.html|title=US Open: Richard Gasquet puts 'Cocaine Kiss' saga behind him|last=Hodgkinson|first=Mark|date=2009-08-31|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maria Sharapova]] (long used drug added to the prohibited list without knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-09/tennis-maria-sharapova-banned-for-two-years-for-doping/7494786|title=Maria Sharapova banned for two years for failing drug test|date=2016-06-09|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in both cases these players were ruled not to be at fault, the strict measures led to legal battle and damage to players reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-09/tennis-maria-sharapova-banned-for-two-years-for-doping/7494786|title=Maria Sharapova banned for two years for failing drug test|date=2016-06-09|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy surrounding doping policy is the strict times at which testing can be carried out that players must hold themselves to or face potential repercussions, as seen with [[Viktor Troicki]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/tennis/beyond-baseline/2013/07/26/viktor-troicki-itf-suspension-appeal-doping|title=Why Viktor Troicki was suspended for anti-doping violation|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was raised by [[Serena Williams]] in 2018 when she was absent from an out-of-competition test that was conducted by the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA) outside the hours that were previously agreed upon by Williams and the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2018/jul/01/serena-williams-and-roger-federer-voice-frustrations-with-tennis-doping-tests-video|title=Serena Williams and Roger Federer voice frustrations with tennis doping tests – video|last=Reuters|first=Source|date=2018-07-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue raised by Williams is the inconsistency of testing. While the ITF, WADA and USADA use randomised testing with the consent of players, there is overlap with certain tests with Williams being tested five times before playing at Wimbledon in 2018 whereas other players had not been subject to the random, out-of-competition test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2018/jul/01/serena-williams-and-roger-federer-voice-frustrations-with-tennis-doping-tests-video|title=Serena Williams and Roger Federer voice frustrations with tennis doping tests – video|last=Reuters|first=Source|date=2018-07-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''tennis scoring system''' is a way to keep track of tennis matches (including [[pick-up game]]s). Some tennis matches are played as part of a tournament. (Tournaments may have various categories, such as singles and doubles.) The great majority are organised as a [[single-elimination tournament]], with competitors being eliminated after a single loss, and the overall winner being the last competitor without a loss. Optimally, such tournaments have a number of competitors equal to a [[power of two]] in order to fully fill out a single elimination bracket. In many professional and top-level amateur events, the brackets are [[Seed (sports)|seeded]] according to a recognised ranking system, in order to keep the best players in the field from facing each other until as late in the tournament as possible; additionally, if [[Bye (sports)|byes]] are necessary because of a less-than-full bracket, those byes in the first round are usually given to the highest-seeded competitors.

A tennis match is composed of [[Point (tennis)|points]], games, and sets. A set consists of a number of games (a minimum of six), which in turn each consist of points. A set is won by the first side to win 6 games, with a margin of at least 2 games over the other side (e.g. 6–3 or 7–5). If the set is tied at six games each, a tie-break is usually played to decide the set. A match is won when a player or a doubles team has won the majority of the prescribed number of sets. Matches employ either a [[Best-of-three playoff|best-of-three]] (first to two sets wins) or [[Best-of-five playoff|best-of-five]] (first to three sets wins) set format. The best-of-five set format is usually only used in the men's singles or doubles matches at [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] and [[Davis Cup]] matches.

==Game score==

===Description===
A game consists of a sequence of [[Point (tennis)|points]] played with the same player serving, and is won by the first side to have won at least four points with a margin of two points or more over their opponent. Normally the server's score is always called first and the receiver's score second. Score calling in tennis is unusual in that (except in tie-breaks) each point has a corresponding call that is different from its point value.  The current point score is announced orally before each point by the judge, or by the server if there is no judge.

For instance, if the server has won three points so far in the game, and the non-server has won one, the score is "40–15".

When both sides have won the same number of points within a given game—i.e., when each side has won one, or two, points—the score is described as "15–all" and "30–all" (or "15–up" and "30–up"), respectively. However, if each player has won three points, the score is called as "'''deuce'''", not "40–all".  From that point on in the game, whenever the score is tied, it is described as "deuce" regardless of how many points have been played.

In standard play, scoring beyond a "deuce" score, in which both players have scored three points each, requires that one player must get two points ahead in order to win the game. This type of tennis scoring is known as "advantage scoring" (or "ads"). The side which wins the next point after deuce is said to have the '''advantage'''. If they lose the next point, the score is again deuce, since the score is tied. If the side with the advantage wins the next point, that side has won the game, since they have a lead of two points.  When the server is the player with the advantage, the score may be called as "advantage in". When the server's opponent has the advantage, the score may be called as "advantage out". These phrases are sometimes shortened to "ad in" or "van in" (or "my ad") and "ad out" (or "your ad"). Alternatively, the players' names are used: in professional tournaments the umpire announces the score in this format (e.g. "advantage [[Rafael Nadal|Nadal]]" or  "advantage [[Serena Williams|Williams]]").

In the [[USTA]] rule book (but not the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] rules), there is the following comment: “ ‘Zero,’ ’one,’ ’two,’ and ’three,’ may be substituted for ’Love,’ ’15,’ ’30,’ and ’40.’ ” This is particularly appropriate for matches with an inexperienced player or in which one player does not understand English.’&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

For tie-breaks, the calls are simply the number of points won by each player.

===History===
The origins of the 15, 30, and 40 scores are believed to be medieval French. The earliest reference is in a ballad by [[Charles, Duke of Orléans|Charles D'Orleans]] in 1435 which refers to ''quarante cinque'' ("forty-five"), which gave rise to modern 40. In 1522, there is a sentence in Latin "we are winning 30, we are winning 45". The first recorded theories about the origin of 15 were published in 1555 and 1579. However, the origins of this convention remain obscure.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Tennis: Origin and mysteries |first=Malcolm |last=Whitman |chapter=The Mystery of Fifteen in Scoring |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2004 |edition=reprint of 1932}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--- [[File:Clock Face Tennis Scoring.jpg|thumb|An illustration of a possible 'clock face' method of tennis scoring, from which the modern system may have evolved.]] image contradicts text and has no apparent source — possible OR? ---&gt;

It is sometimes believed that [[clock face]]s were used to keep score on court, with a quarter move of the minute hand to indicate a score of 15, 30, and 45. When the hand moved to 60, the game was over. However, in order to ensure that the game could not be won by a one-point difference in players' scores, the idea of "''deuce''" was introduced. To make the score stay within the "60" ticks on the clock face, the 45 was changed to 40. Therefore, if both players had 40, the first player to score would receive ten, and that would move the clock to 50. If the player scored a second time before the opponent is able to score, they would be awarded another ten and the clock would move to 60. The 60 signifies the end of the game. However, if a player fails to score twice in a row, then the clock would move back to 40 to establish another "''deuce''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-08-31/news/1998243026_1_tennis-scoring-bud-collins-love-tennis |publisher=The Baltimore Sun |title=A scoring system you have to love |accessdate=29 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232113/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-08-31/news/1998243026_1_tennis-scoring-bud-collins-love-tennis |archive-date=1 February 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepostgame.com/features/201106/so-whats-scoring-system-and-other-tennis-faqs |via=Yahoo Sports|title= So What's Up with the Strange Scoring System? |accessdate=29 January 2014 |author=Hart, Jay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202100933/http://www.thepostgame.com/features/201106/so-whats-scoring-system-and-other-tennis-faqs |archive-date=2 February 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this suggestion might sound attractive, the first reference to tennis scoring (as mentioned above) is in the 15th century, and at that time clocks measured only the hours (1 to 12). It was not until about 1690, when the more accurate [[pendulum]] [[escapement]] was invented, that clocks regularly had minute hands. So the concept of tennis scores originating from the clock face could not have come from medieval times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Time and Timekeepers |last=Milham |first=Willis I. |publisher=MacMillan |year= |isbn=0-7808-0008-7 |location=New York |page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory is that the scoring nomenclature came from the French game ''[[jeu de paume]]'' (a precursor to tennis which initially used the hand instead of a racket). Jeu de paume was very popular before the [[French Revolution]], with more than 1,000 courts in Paris alone. The traditional court was 90&amp;nbsp;feet (''[[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution#Length|pieds du roi]]'') in length with 45&amp;nbsp;feet on each side. When the server scored, he or she moved forward 15&amp;nbsp;feet. If the server scored again, he or she would move another 15&amp;nbsp;feet. If the server scored a third time, he or she could only move 10&amp;nbsp;feet closer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jeu de Paume: History |publisher=Réunion des musées nationaux |author=Françoise Bonnefoy |year=1991 |page=42 |isbn=978-2908901016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the use of "love" for zero is also disputed. The most likely explanation is that it derives from the French expression for "the egg" (''l'œuf'') because an egg looks like the number zero.&lt;ref&gt;Palmatier, Robert.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=kSr4fO2zYrIC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=love+l%27oeuf+tennis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Flr8S8ukFYOB8gb_4ND6BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=love%20l%27oeuf%20tennis&amp;f=false Speaking of animals: a dictionary of animal metaphors], p. 245 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horn, Geoffrey.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=tQoY647Kk-wC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=love+l%27oeuf+tennis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Flr8S8ukFYOB8gb_4ND6BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=love%20l%27oeuf%20tennis&amp;f=false Rafael Nadal], p. 13 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the origin of the term "duck" in [[cricket]], supposedly from "duck's egg", referring to a batsman who has been called out without scoring a run. Another possibility comes from the Dutch expression ''iets voor lof doen'', which means to do something for praise, implying no monetary stakes.&lt;ref&gt;Bondt, Cees de (1993) ''Heeft yemant lust met bal, of met reket te spelen...?'' Hilversum: Uitgeverij Verloren p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory on the origins of the use of "love" comes from the notion that, at the start of any match, when scores are at zero, players still have "love for each other".&lt;ref&gt;Collynshum, Cirt Frijk (1971) ''Brikt noordjest tennis ul areven'' Kreb.: Steken of en lad Verk p.&amp;nbsp;132&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative ("no-ad") game scoring===
A popular alternative to advantage scoring is "no-advantage" (or "no-ad") scoring, created by [[Jimmy Van Alen|James Van Alen]] in order to shorten match playing time.&lt;ref name=":00"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.usta.com/Improve-Your-Game/Rules/Rules-and-Line-Calls/Scoring/ |work=Improving your game |title=Scoring |publisher=[[USTA]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203191639/http://www.usta.com/Improve-Your-Game/Rules/Rules-and-Line-Calls/Scoring/ |archive-date=3 February 2014 |url-status=dead}}
&lt;/ref&gt; No-advantage scoring is a scoring method in which the first player to reach four points wins the game.  No-ad scoring eliminates the requirement that a player must win by two points.  Therefore, if the game is tied at deuce, the next player to win a point wins the game.  This method of scoring is used in most [[World TeamTennis]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usta.com/Improve-Your-Game/Rules/Rules-and-Line-Calls/Scoring/ |title=USTA: Improve Your Game |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtt.com/page.aspx?article_id=75 |title=WTT Rules |accessdate=29 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807104224/http://www.wtt.com/page.aspx?article_id=75 |archivedate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this style of play is implemented, at deuce, the receiver then chooses from which side of the court he or she desires to return the serve.  However, in no-ad mixed doubles play, each gender always serves to the same gender at game point and during the final point of tiebreaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/equipment/appendixiv.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406154923/http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/equipment/appendixiv.asp |archive-date=6 April 2012 |website=ITF tennis.com |title=Appendix IV – Alternative Procedures and Scoring Methods}} Extract from Rules of Tennis 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{Anchor|Set_score}}Set score==

===Description===
In tennis, a set consists of a sequence of games played with alternating service and return roles. There are two types of set formats that require different types of scoring.&lt;ref name="RulesITF2010"/&gt;

An ''advantage set'' is played until a player or team has won at least 6 games and that player or team has a 2-game lead over their opponent(s). The set continues, without tiebreak(er), until a player or team wins the set by 2 games. Advantage sets are no longer played under the rules of the [[United States Tennis Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dps.usta.com/usta_master/usta/doc/content/doc_13_4204.pdf |title=Part 7 - Glossary |website=USTennis.com |accessdate=29 March 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115053554/http://dps.usta.com/usta_master/usta/doc/content/doc_13_4204.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor in the [[Australian Open]] starting from 2019;&lt;ref name="FinalSet"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ausopen.com/articles/news/final-set-tiebreaks-australian-open-2019 |title=Final set tiebreaks at Australian Open 2019. |website=The Australian Open |accessdate=17 March 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128200017/https://ausopen.com/articles/news/final-set-tiebreaks-australian-open-2019 |archivedate=28 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they are still used in the final sets in men's and women's singles in the [[French Open]] and [[Fed Cup]]. [[The Championships|Wimbledon]] uses a unique scoring system for the last set where the players continue to play after 6–6 as in an advantage set until a player earns a 2-game lead. However, if the players reach 12–12, a 7-point tie-breaker is played to determine the winner. Mixed doubles at the Grand Slams (except for Wimbledon) are a best-of-three format with the final set being played as a "Super Tie Break" (sometimes referred to as a "best of two" format) except at Wimbledon, which still plays a best-of-three match with the final set played as an advantage set and the first two played as tie-break sets.

A ''tie-break set'' is played with the same rules as the advantage set, except that when the score is tied at 6–6, a tie-break game (or tiebreaker) is played. Typically, the tie-break game continues until one side has won seven points with a margin of two or more points. However, many tie-break games are played with different tiebreak point requirements, such as 8 or 10 points. Often, a 7-point tie-breaker is played when the set score is tied at 6–6 to determine who wins the set. If the tiebreak score gets to 6–6, then whichever player to win the best of two points wins the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennistips.org/tennis-score.html |title=Tie-Breaker Scoring, 'The Tennis Score Solution - Break The Tie - Finish The Set' |website=TennisTips.org |accessdate=29 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217082412/http://www.tennistips.org/tennis-score.html |archive-date=17 February 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The score of games within a set is counted in the ordinary manner, except that when a player or team has a score of no games it is read as "love". The score is written using digits separated by a dash. This score is announced by the judge or server at the start of each game.

{| class="wikitable"

|  0–0

|  "set"
|}

In doubles, service alternates between the teams. One player serves for an entire service game, with that player's partner serving for the entirety of the team's next service game. Players of the receiving team receive the serve on alternating points, with each player of the receiving team declaring which side of the court (deuce or ad side) they will receive serve on for the duration of the set. Teams alternate service games every game.

=== Comparison ===

''Advantage sets'' sometimes continue much longer than ''tie-break sets''. The [[Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships|2010 Wimbledon first-round match]] between [[John Isner]] and [[Nicolas Mahut]], which is the longest professional tennis match in history, notably ended with Isner winning the fifth set by 70–68. The match lasted in total 11 hours and five minutes, with the fifth set alone lasting eight hours, 11 minutes. Whoever wins by a margin of two wins the set, but this could take a very long time to finish.

Nevertheless, even tie-break sets can last a long time. For instance, once players reach 6–6 set score and also reach 6–6 tiebreaker score, play must continue until one player has a 2-point advantage, which can take [[Longest tiebreaker in tennis|a considerable time]]. Sets decided by tiebreakers, however, are typically significantly shorter than extended advantage sets.

The set is won by the first player (or team) to have won at least six games and at least two games more than his or her opponent. Traditionally, sets would be played until both these criteria had been met, with no maximum number of games. To shorten matches, [[Jimmy Van Alen|James Van Alen]] created a tie-breaker system, which was widely introduced in the early 1970s. If the score reaches 6–5 (or 5–6), one further game is played. If the leading player wins this game, the set is won 7–5 (or 5–7). If the trailing player wins the game, the score is tied at 6–6 and a special tiebreaker game is played. The winner of the tiebreak wins the set by a score of 7–6 (or 6–7).

The tiebreak is sometimes not employed for the final set of a match and an advantage set is used instead. Therefore, the deciding set must be played until one player or team has won two more games than the opponent. Of the major tennis championships, this now only applies in the [[French Open]]. In the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], a tiebreak is played in the deciding set (fifth set for the men, third set for the women) at 6–6. Starting in 2019, in [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], a tiebreak will be played if the score reaches 12–12 in the final set. In the [[Australian Open]], a "first to 10" tiebreak is played in the deciding set if it reaches 6–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2018-10-19/aeltc_announces_introduction_of_final_set_tiebreak.html|title=The Championships, Wimbledon 2018 – Official Site by IBM|website=www.wimbledon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ausopen.com/articles/news/final-set-tiebreaks-australian-open-2019|title=Final set tiebreaks at Australian Open 2019|website=www.ausopen.com|date=21 December 2018|accessdate=8 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (When the tiebreak was first introduced at Wimbledon in 1971, it was invoked at 8–8 rather than 6–6.) The US Open formerly held "Super Saturday" where the two men's semi-finals were played along with the women's final on the second Saturday of the event; therefore a tie-break was more prudent where player rest and scheduling is more important.

===Scoring a tiebreak game=== &lt;!-- [[Tiebreaker (tennis)]] redirects here. don't change the header! --&gt;
At a score of 6–6, a set is often determined by one more game called a "twelve point tiebreaker" (or just "tiebreak"). Only one more game is played to determine the winner of the set; the score of the resulting completed set is 7–6 or 6–7 (though it can be 6–6 if a player retires before completion).&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [[2007 Australian Open – Men's Singles#Section 8|Verdasco v. Mathieu in the 2007 Australian Open]], where Mathieu retired in the 3rd set tiebreak due to injury (despite being up 2 sets to none and 3 points to 1 in the tiebreak)&lt;/ref&gt;

Points are counted using ordinary numbering. The set is won by the player who has scored at least seven points in the tiebreak and at least two points more than their opponent. For example, if the score is 6 points to 5 and the player with 6 points wins the next point, they win the tiebreak (7 points to 5), as well as the set (7 games to 6). If the player with 5 points wins the point instead (for a score of 6–6), the tiebreak continues and cannot be won on the next point (7–6 or 6–7), since no player will be two points ahead.  In the scoring of the set, sometimes the tiebreak points are shown as well as the game count, e.g., 7–6&lt;sup&gt;10–8&lt;/sup&gt;. Another way of listing the score of the tiebreak is to list only the loser's points. For example, if the set score is listed as 7–6&lt;sup&gt;(8)&lt;/sup&gt;, the tiebreak score was 10–8 (since the 8 is the loser's score, and the winner must win by two points). Similarly, 7–6&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt; means the tiebreak score was 7–3.

The player who would normally be serving after 6–6 is the one to serve first in the tiebreak, and the tiebreak is considered a [[service game]] for this player. The server begins his or her service from the [[deuce court]] and serves one point. After the first point, the serve changes to the first server's opponent. Each player then serves two consecutive points for the remainder of the tiebreak. The first of each two-point sequence starts from the server's [[advantage court]] and the second starts from the deuce court. In this way, the sum of the scores is even when the server serves from the deuce court. After every six points, the players switch ends of the court; note that the side-changes during the tiebreak will occur in the middle of a server's two-point sequence.  At the end of the tiebreak, the players switch ends of the court again, since the set score is always odd (13 games).

An alternative tie-break system called the "Coman Tie-Break" is sometimes used by the United States Tennis Association. Scoring is the same, but end changes take place after the first point and then after every four points. This approach allows the servers of doubles teams to continue serving from the same end of the court as during the body of the set. It also reduces the advantage the elements (e.g. wind and sun) could give playing the first six points of a seven-point tiebreak on one side of the court.

The French open is the only Grand Slam or professional tournament where in the fifth set at 6-6 a tiebreak is not played and rather games are continued to be played out until a 2 game lead occurs. 

====History of the tiebreak====
The tiebreaker – more recently shortened to just "tiebreak", though both terms are still used interchangeably – was invented by [[Jimmy Van Alen (tennis player)|James Van Alen]] and unveiled in 1965 as an experiment at the pro tournament he sponsored at Newport Casino, Rhode Island,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=Z1cr577EpcUC&amp;pg=PT365&amp;lpg=PT365&amp;dq=Copenhague+1992,+Aki+Rahunen++Peter+Nyborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jNDp2gSl7-&amp;sig=pfiJXoUfBUsQfVPifHu4SGebS0g&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=cPDZTpbZIdCChQeKpvy3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=Copenhague+1992,+Aki+Rahunen++Peter+Nyborg&amp;f=false |title=Tennis Confidential: Today's Greatest Players, Matches, and Controversies |first=Paul |last=Fein |date=29 March 2018 |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc. |accessdate=29 March 2018 |via=Google Books |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330080142/https://books.google.fr/books?id=Z1cr577EpcUC&amp;pg=PT365&amp;lpg=PT365&amp;dq=Copenhague+1992,+Aki+Rahunen++Peter+Nyborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jNDp2gSl7-&amp;sig=pfiJXoUfBUsQfVPifHu4SGebS0g&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=cPDZTpbZIdCChQeKpvy3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=Copenhague+1992,+Aki+Rahunen++Peter+Nyborg&amp;f=false |archive-date=30 March 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; after an earlier, unsuccessful attempt to speed up the game by the use of his so-called "Van Alen Streamlined Scoring System" ("VASSS"). For two years before the Open Era, in 1955 and 1956, the [[United States Pro Championship]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], was played by VASSS rules. The scoring was the same as that in [[table tennis]], with sets played to 21 points and players alternating five services, with no second service.  The rules were created partially to limit the effectiveness of the powerful service of the reigning professional champion, [[Pancho Gonzales]]. Even with the new rules, however, Gonzales beat [[Pancho Segura]] in the finals of both tournaments. Even though the 1955 match went to 5 sets, with Gonzales barely holding on to win the last one 21–19, it is reported to have taken 47 minutes to complete.&lt;ref&gt;USTA Midwest,{{cite web |url=http://www.midwest.usta.com/content/custom.sps?iType=1435&amp;icustompageid=2647 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 May 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427021758/http://www.midwest.usta.com/content/custom.sps?iType=1435&amp;icustompageid=2647 |archivedate=27 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fans attending the matches preferred the traditional rules, however, and in 1957 the tournament reverted to the old method of scoring.

Van Alen called his innovation a "tiebreaker", and he actually proposed two different kinds or versions of it: ''best-five-of-nine-points tiebreaker'' and ''best-seven-of-12-points tiebreaker''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The first lasts a maximum of 9 points, and awards victory in the set to whichever player or team first reaches 5 points – even if the other player or team already has 4; the margin of victory can be a single point.  Because this "9-point" tiebreaker ''must'' end after a maximum of 9 points, even if neither player or team has a 2-point (or greater) margin, Van Alen also called it a "sudden-death tiebreaker" (If and when the score reached four points all, both players faced simultaneous set point and/or match point.). This type of tiebreaker had its Grand Slam debut at 1970 [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and was employed there until 1974. Apart from being used for 5 years at US Open it was also used 1 year at Wimbledon and for a while on the Virginia Slims circuit and in American Colleges.

The other type of tiebreaker Van Alen introduced is the "12-point" tiebreaker that is most familiar and widely used today.  Because it ends as soon as either player or team reaches 7 points – provided that that player or team leads the other at that point by ''at least'' two points – it ''can'' actually be over in as few as 7 points.  However, because the winning player or team ''must'' win by a margin of at least two points, a "12-point" tiebreaker may go beyond 12 points – sometimes [[Longest tiebreaker in tennis|well beyond]].  That is why Van Alen derisively likened it to a "lingering death", in contrast to the 9-point (or fewer) "sudden-death tiebreaker" that he recommended and preferred.

The impetus to use ''some'' kind of a tie-breaking procedure gained force after a monumental 1969 struggle at Wimbledon between [[Pancho Gonzales]] and [[Charlie Pasarell]]. This was a 5-set match that lasted five hours and 12 minutes and took 2 days to complete. In the fifth set the 41-year-old Gonzales won all seven match points that Pasarell had against him, twice coming back from 0–40 deficits. The final score was 22–24, 1–6, 16–14, 6–3, 11–9 for Gonzales.

The tiebreaker gave tennis a definite "finish line".

:''In what follows, the "final set" means the fifth set for best-of-five matches, and the third set for best-of-three matches.''

In 1971, the nine-point tiebreaker was introduced at Wimbledon (the first scoring change at Wimbledon in 94 years).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1972, Wimbledon put into effect a 12-point tiebreaker when the score in a set reached 8–8 in games unless the set was such that one of the players could achieve a match victory by winning it.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1979, Wimbledon changed their rules so that a (12-point) tiebreak would be played once any set except the final set reached 6–6 in games.

In 1989, the Davis Cup adopted the tie-break in all sets except for the final set, and then extended it to the final set starting in 2016.

In 2001, the Australian Open replaced the deciding third set of mixed doubles with an eighteen-point "match tiebreak" (first to ten points and win by two points wins the match).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=CNNSI.com |title=Reactions: Mixed doubles |quote=Responses overwhelmingly against new format |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/your_turn/news/2001/01/16/reactions_mixeddoubles/ |date=2001-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616155150/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/your_turn/news/2001/01/16/reactions_mixeddoubles/ |archive-date=2004-06-16 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some criticism of the change by fans and former pros,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What They're Saying about Tiebreakers Replacing Third Sets … |url=http://www.tennisconfidential.com/articles6.htm |website=Articles &amp; Essays by Paul Fein |access-date=2019-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827003945/http://www.tennisconfidential.com/articles6.htm |archive-date=27 August 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US Open (from 2003) and the French Open (from 2007) have followed the Australian Open in using the same format for mixed doubles. Wimbledon continues to play a traditional best of three match, with a tie-break in the final set at 12–12 (advantage set was played before 2019).

Tie-break sets are now nearly universal in all levels of play, for all sets in a match; however, the tie-break is not a compulsory element in any set, and the actual formatting of sets and tie-breaks depends on the tournament director in tournaments, and, in private matches, on the players' agreement before play begins. Currently, the French Open is the only tournament to not use a tie-break for the deciding set in singles. Tie-breaks were not used in the final set in the [[Australian Open]] for singles before 2019, [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] before 2019, or the [[Fed Cup]] before 2019, nor were they used for final sets in [[Davis Cup]] play or the [[Olympics]] before 2016. The [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] has used a tiebreak in the final set, both in singles and in doubles, since 1970, and was the only [[Grand Slam (tennis)|major tournament]] to use a tiebreak in the final set for singles before 2019. However, the [[Australian Open]] and [[French Open]] do use a final set tiebreak in both men's and women's doubles.

After criticism of two lengthy semifinals in the [[2018 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|2018 Men's Singles]], Wimbledon announced the [[2019 Wimbledon Championships|2019 Championships]] would use final-set tiebreaks if the score reaches 12 games all.&lt;ref name="BBC-20181019"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/45913728|title=Wimbledon: Final set tie-breaks to be introduced in 2019|work=BBC Sport|date=19 October 2018|accessdate=15 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind-20181019"&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Menezes |first1=Jack |title=Wimbledon announces radical rule change from 2019 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon-rule-change-final-set-tie-break-end-long-matches-a8591621.html |publisher=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=20 January 2019 |language=en |date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such was in the [[2019 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Doubles#Section 3|Men's Doubles third round]], with [[Henri Kontinen]] and [[John Peers]] defeating [[Rajeev Ram]] and [[Joe Salisbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History made: Doubles match goes to Wimbledon's first 12–12 final-set tie-break |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/av/48926249 |website=www.bbc.com |accessdate=10 July 2019 |date=9 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly following Wimbledon's final set tiebreak introduction announcement, the Australian Open also for their 2019 tournament has now introduced a "super-tiebreak" at 6-6 for both singles and doubles (but not mixed doubles) in the final set, replacing the previous format in which the final set would continue until one player was ahead by two games. The new format for the final set is similar to the "12-point tiebreaker", but with the winner being the first to 10 points instead of 7 (and they must still win by 2 points).&lt;ref name="BBC-20181221"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/46647600|title=Australian Open: Final-set tie-breaks to be used in 2019|work=BBC Sport|date=21 December 2018|accessdate=15 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tennis Australia]] has called this a "10-point tiebreak", though this is inconsistent with the reasoning behind the naming of the "12-point tiebreaker", which represents the minimum total number of points (a score of 7–5); the same reasoning would make the new format an "18-point tiebreaker" with a minimum winning score of 10–8.&lt;ref name="FinalSet"/&gt;

{{As of|2019}}, the French Open remains the only one among the grand slam tournaments that does not utilize any form of a tie-break for singles in the final set; each of the four grand slam tournaments have now effectively adopted different rules governing how the final set for singles will be concluded in close matches.

===Alternative set scoring format===
While traditional sets continue until a player wins at least six games by a margin of at least two games there are some alternative set scoring formats in use.  A common alternative set format is the eight or nine game pro set.  Instead of playing until one player reaches six games with a margin of two games, one plays until one player wins eight or nine games with a margin of two games.  A tie-break is then played at eight or nine games all.  While the format is not used in modern professional matches or recognized by the ITF rules, it was supposedly used in early professional tours.  It is commonly utilized in various amateur leagues and high school tennis as a shorter alternative to a best of three match, but longer than a traditional tie-break set. In addition, eight game pro sets were used during doubles for all Division I college dual matches, until the 2014–2015 season.&lt;ref name=":00"/&gt;

Another alternative set format are so called "short sets" where the first to four games to win by two games.  In this format a tie-break is played at four games all.  The ITF experimented with this format in low level Davis Cup matches, but the experiment was not continued.  Nevertheless, this alternative remains as an acceptable alternative in the ITF rules of Tennis.&lt;ref name="RulesITF2010"/&gt;

Another alternative set format is seen in [[World Team Tennis]] where the winner of a set is the first to win five games and a nine-point tie-break is played at 4–4.

An alternative to Tennis Australia's Fast4 shorter scoring method is Thirty30 tennis where every game starts at 30–30. Thirty30 (T30) is a shortened format of tennis and can be described as the tennis equivalent of the Twenty20 (T20) format of cricket. Sets are rather short: One set is generally played in 20 minutes.

==Match score==

===Description===
The winner is the side that wins more than half of the sets, and the match ends as soon as this is achieved. Men's matches may be the best of either three or five sets, while women's and mixed doubles matches are usually best of three sets.

The alternation of service between games continues throughout the match without regard to sets, but the ends are changed after each odd game within a set (including the last game). If, for example, the second set of a match ends with the score at 6–3, 1–6, the ends are changed as the last game played was the 7th (odd) game of the set and in spite of it being the 16th (even) game of the match. Even when a set ends with an odd game, ends are again changed after the first game of the following set. A tiebreaker game is treated as a single game for the purposes of this alternation. Since tiebreakers always result in a score of 7–6, there is always a court change after the tiebreaker.

The score of a complete match may be given simply by sets won, or with the scores in each set given separately. In either case, the match winner's score is stated first. In the former, shorter form, a match might be listed as 3–1 (i.e. three sets to one). In the latter form, this same match might be further described as "7–5, 6–7&lt;sup&gt;(4–7)&lt;/sup&gt;, 6–4, 7–6&lt;sup&gt;(8–6)&lt;/sup&gt;". (As noted above, an alternate form of writing the tiebreak score lists only the loser's score{{snd}}e.g., "7–6&lt;sup&gt;(6)&lt;/sup&gt;" for the fourth set in the example.) This match was won three sets to one, with the match loser winning the second set on a tiebreaker. The numbers in parentheses, normally included in printed scorelines but omitted when spoken, indicate the duration of the tiebreaker following a given set. Here, the match winner lost the second-set tiebreaker 7–4 and won the fourth-set tiebreaker 8–6.

===Total points won===
Because tennis is scored set by set and game by game, a player may lose a match despite winning the majority of points and/or games played.

Consider a player who wins six games in each of two sets, all by a score of game–30. The winner has scored 4×12 = 48 points and the loser 2×12 = 24. Suppose also that the loser wins four games in each set, all by a score of game-love. The loser has scored 4×8 = 32 points and the winner zero in those games. The final score is a win by 6–4, 6–4; total points 48–56.

An example of this in actual practice was the record-breaking [[Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships|Isner-Mahut match]] in the Wimbledon first round, 22–24 June 2010. American [[John Isner]] beat [[Nicolas Mahut]] of France 6–4, 3–6, 6–7&lt;sup&gt;(7–9)&lt;/sup&gt;, 7–6&lt;sup&gt;(7–3)&lt;/sup&gt;, 70–68 – Mahut winning a total of 502 points to Isner's 478.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day11/1160ms.html |title=Wimbledon Championships Website |publisher=Wimbledon.org |date=21 September 1998 |accessdate=28 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627113000/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day11/1160ms.html |archive-date=27 June 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Total games won===
Likewise, a player may lose a match despite winning the majority of games played (or win a match despite losing the majority of games). [[Roger Federer]] won the 2009 Wimbledon final over [[Andy Roddick]] (5–7, 7–6&lt;sup&gt;(8–6)&lt;/sup&gt;, 7–6&lt;sup&gt;(7–5)&lt;/sup&gt;, 3–6, 16–14) despite Roddick's winning more games (39, versus Federer's 38). Roger Federer also lost the [[2019 Wimbledon Championships – Men's singles final|2019 Wimbledon final]], despite winning more games (and in fact more points as well) than [[Novak Djokovic]].

==Announcing the score==
When playing a match, it is usually best to report each score out loud with one's opponent to avoid conflicts. During a game, the server has the responsibility to announce the game score before serving. This is done by announcing the server's score first. If, for example, the server loses the first three points of his or her service game, he or she would say "love–40". This is to be done every time. After a set is complete, the server, before serving for the first game of the next set, announces the set scores so far completed in the match, stating his or her own scores first. If the server has won the first two sets and is beginning the third, he or she would say, "two–love, new set." If the server had lost the first two sets, he or she would say, "love–two, new set." Finally, after the completion of the match, either player, when asked the score, announces his or her own scores first.

As an example, consider a match between [[Victoria Azarenka]] and [[Ana Ivanovic]]. Azarenka wins the first set 6–4, Ivanovic wins the next set 7–6 (winning the tie break 7–4), and Azarenka wins the final set 6–0.

At the end of each set, the umpire would announce the winner of each set:
:''Game, first set, Azarenka.''
:''Game, second set, Ivanovic.''

At the completion of the match, the result would be announced as:

:''Game, set, match, (Victoria) Azarenka, two sets to one, six–four, six–seven, six–love.''

The result would be written as:

:{{flagicon|BLR}} '''Victoria Azarenka''' defeated {{flagicon|SRB}} Ana Ivanovic 6–4, 6–7&lt;sup&gt;(4–7)&lt;/sup&gt;, 6–0

The score is always written and announced in respect to the winner of the match. The score of the tiebreak is not included in announcing the final result; it is simply said "seven–six" or "six–seven" regardless of the score in the tiebreak.

If a match ends prematurely due to one player retiring or being disqualified (defaulting), the partial score at that point is announced as the final score, with the remaining player as the nominal winner. For instance, the result in the final of the [[2012 Aegon Championships]] was written and announced as follows:

:{{flagicon|CRO}} '''[[Marin Čilić]]''' defeated {{flagicon|ARG}} [[David Nalbandian]] 6–7&lt;sup&gt;(3–7)&lt;/sup&gt;, 4–3 (default)
:''Code violation, unsportsmanlike conduct, default, Mr. (David) Nalbandian.''

=== Variations and slang ===
During informal play of tennis, especially at tennis clubs in the U.S. (also in other English speaking countries), score announcements are frequently shortened with the use of abbreviations. For example, a score 15 is replaced with "five", or in some cases "fif". "Love" is often substituted to indicate "zero".  Similarly, the scores of 30 and 40 may sometimes be spoken as "three" or "four" respectively. A score of 15-all may sometimes be announced as "fives." To further confuse score announcements, a score of 30-all (30–30) may often be called "deuce", and the following point referred to as "ad in" or "ad out" (or "my ad" or "your ad"), depending on which player (or team) won the point. The logic for this is that a 30-all score is ''effectively'' the same as deuce (40–40).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tt.tennis-warehouse.com/showthread.php?t=258764 |title=Why do club players say "five" not "fifteen" when scoring? – Talk Tennis |publisher=Tt.tennis-warehouse.com |accessdate=28 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303022045/http://tt.tennis-warehouse.com/showthread.php?t=258764 |archive-date=3 March 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For formal scorekeeping, the official scoring the match (e.g. the chair umpire) fills out a scorecard, either on paper or electronically. The scorecard allows the official to record details for each point, as well as rule violations and other match information. Standard markings for each point are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.usta.com/assets/1/USTA_Import/USTA/dps/doc_13_2319.pdf |title=USTA Chair Umpire Handbook |website=United States Tennis Association |accessdate=29 March 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906015543/http://assets.usta.com/assets/1/USTA_Import/USTA/dps/doc_13_2319.pdf |archivedate=6 September 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematicians seek and use [[pattern]]s&lt;ref name=future/&gt;&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt; to formulate new [[conjecture]]s; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by [[mathematical proof]]. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] and [[logic]], mathematics developed from [[counting]], [[calculation]], [[measurement]], and the systematic study of the [[shape]]s and [[motion (physics)|motions]] of [[physical objects]]. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as [[History of Mathematics|written records]] exist. The [[research]] required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

[[Logic|Rigorous arguments]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.F99/Wise/essay7/essay7.htm|title=Eudoxus' Influence on Euclid's Elements with a close look at The Method of Exhaustion|last=Wise|first=David|date=|website=jwilson.coe.uga.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601004355/http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt668/EMAT6680.F99/Wise/essay7/essay7.htm|archive-date=June 1, 2019|access-date=2019-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the pioneering work of [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1858–1932), [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943), and others [[Foundations of mathematics|on axiomatic systems in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century]], it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing [[truth]] by [[Mathematical rigor|rigorous]] [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from appropriately chosen [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the [[Renaissance]], when mathematical innovations interacting with new [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics is essential in many fields, including [[natural science]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[finance]], and the [[social sciences]]. [[Applied mathematics]] has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as [[statistics]] and [[game theory]]. Mathematicians engage in [[pure mathematics]] (mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wigner1960 /&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of mathematics}}
The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstractions]]. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abstract representations of numbers in the animal and human brain |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=21 |issue=8 |date=Aug 1998 |pages=355–61 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01263-6 |pmid=9720604 |ref=harv |last1=Dehaene |first1=Stanislas |last2=Dehaene-Lambertz |first2=Ghislaine |last3=Cohen |first3=Laurent}}&lt;/ref&gt; was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.

As evidenced by [[tally sticks|tallies]] found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to [[counting|count]] physical objects, [[prehistoric]] peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time—days, seasons, or years.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Raymond L. Wilder, ''Evolution of Mathematical Concepts; an Elementary Study'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Plimpton 322.jpg|thumb|The Babylonian mathematical tablet Plimpton 322, dated to 1800 BC.]]
Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000&amp;nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]], when the [[Babylonia]]ns and Egyptians began using [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1990, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient mathematical texts from [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] are from 2000–1800 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyofmathematics.com/egyptian.html|title=Egyptian Mathematics – The Story of Mathematics|website=www.storyofmathematics.com|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916192024/http://storyofmathematics.com/egyptian.html|archive-date=September 16, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many early texts mention [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyofmathematics.com/sumerian.html|title=Sumerian/Babylonian Mathematics – The Story of Mathematics|website=www.storyofmathematics.com|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190907175552/http://www.storyofmathematics.com/sumerian.html|archive-date=September 7, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in [[Babylonian mathematics]] that [[elementary arithmetic]] ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]]) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is still in use today for measuring angles and time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" pp. 24–27}}
[[File:Archimedes pi.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]] to approximate the value of [[pi]].]]
Beginning in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], the [[Ancient Greeks]] began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right with [[Greek mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heath |first=Thomas Little |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofgreekma0002heat |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofgreekma0002heat/page/n14 1] |title=A History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid |location=New York |publisher=Dover Publications |date=1981 |orig-year=1921 |isbn=978-0-486-24073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 300 BC, [[Euclid]] introduced the [[axiomatic method]] still used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof.

During the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]], especially during the 9th and 10th&amp;nbsp;centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of [[Islamic mathematics]] was the development of [[algebra]]. Other notable achievements of the Islamic period are advances in [[spherical trigonometry]] and the addition of the [[decimal point]] to the Arabic numeral system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyofmathematics.com/islamic.html|title=Islamic Mathematics – The Story of Mathematics|website=www.storyofmathematics.com|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017220213/https://www.storyofmathematics.com/islamic.html|archive-date=October 17, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarismi]], [[Omar Khayyam]] and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]].

During the [[early modern period]], mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in [[Western Europe]]. The development of [[calculus]] by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyofmathematics.com/17th.html|title=17th Century Mathematics – The Story of Mathematics|website=www.storyofmathematics.com|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916223312/http://www.storyofmathematics.com/17th.html|archive-date=September 16, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonhard Euler]] was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyofmathematics.com/18th_euler.html|title=Euler – 18th Century Mathematics – The Story of Mathematics|website=www.storyofmathematics.com|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502123501/http://www.storyofmathematics.com/18th_euler.html|archive-date=May 2, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyofmathematics.com/19th_gauss.html|title=Gauss – 19th Century Mathematics – The Story of Mathematics|website=www.storyofmathematics.com|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725165145/http://www.storyofmathematics.com/19th_gauss.html|archive-date=July 25, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; who made numerous contributions to fields such as [[algebra]], [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[differential geometry and topology|differential geometry]], [[matrix theory]], [[number theory]], and [[statistics]]. In the early 20th century, [[Kurt Gödel]] transformed mathematics by publishing his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]], which show in part that any consistent axiomatic system—if powerful enough to describe arithmetic—will contain true propositions that cannot be proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyofmathematics.com/20th_godel.html|title=20th Century Mathematics – Gödel|website=The Story of Mathematics|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916192227/http://www.storyofmathematics.com/20th_godel.html|archive-date=September 16, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January&amp;nbsp;2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9&amp;nbsp;million, and more than 75&amp;nbsp;thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical [[theorem]]s and their [[mathematical proof|proofs]]."{{sfn|Sevryuk|2006|pp=101–09}}

===Etymology===
The word ''mathematics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] μάθημα (''máthēma''), meaning "that which is learnt",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=mathematic |dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307093926/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=March 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science". The word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.&lt;ref&gt;Both meanings can be found in Plato, the narrower in [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Rep.+6.510c&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168 510c], but Plato did not use a ''math-'' word; Aristotle did, commenting on it. {{LSJ|maqhmatiko/s|μαθηματική|ref}}. ''OED Online'', "Mathematics".&lt;/ref&gt; Its adjective is {{lang|grc|μαθηματικός}} (''mathēmatikós''), meaning "related to learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical". In particular, {{lang|grc|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}} (''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē''), {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}, meant "the mathematical art".

Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in [[Pythagoreanism]] was known as the ''mathēmatikoi'' (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "learners" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyofmathematics.com/greek_pythagoras.html|title=Pythagoras – Greek Mathematics – The Story of Mathematics|website=www.storyofmathematics.com|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215259/https://www.storyofmathematics.com/greek_pythagoras.html|archive-date=September 17, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term ''mathematics'' more commonly meant "astrology" (or sometimes "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, [[Saint Augustine]]'s warning that Christians should beware of ''mathematici'', meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lion Hunting and Other Mathematical Pursuits: A Collection of Mathematics, Verse, and Stories by the Late Ralph P. Boas, Jr | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Boas, Ralph | authorlink=Ralph P.

The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|les mathématiques}} (and the less commonly used singular derivative {{lang|fr|la mathématique}}), goes back to the Latin neuter plural {{lang|la|mathematica}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural {{lang|el|τὰ μαθηματικά}} (''ta mathēmatiká''), used by [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical", although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of ''[[physics]]'' and ''[[metaphysics]]'', which were inherited from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to ''maths'' or, in North America, ''math''.&lt;ref name=maths&gt;[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114982 "maths, ''n.''"] and [http://oed.com/view/Entry/114962 "math, ''n.3''"].

An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was [[Benjamin Peirce]]'s "the science that draws necessary conclusions" (1870).&lt;ref name="Peirce"&gt;{{cite book |title=Linear Associative Algebra |publisher=Van Nostrand |author=Peirce, Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Peirce |year=1882 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_De0GAAAAYAAJ/page/n62 1] |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_De0GAAAAYAAJ |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] advanced the philosophical program known as [[logicism]], and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of [[symbolic logic]]. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic" (1903).&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesmathe00russgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/principlesmathe00russgoog/page/n36 5]|title=The Principles of Mathematics|year=1903|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|access-date=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intuitionist]] definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt; A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct. Intuitionists also reject the [[law of excluded middle]]—a stance which forces them to reject [[proof by contradiction]] as a viable proof method as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#contradiction|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon – Proof by Contradiction|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020235508/https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary#contradiction|archive-date=October 20, 2019|access-date=2019-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalist]] definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. [[Haskell Curry]] defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics |publisher=Elsevier |author=Curry, Haskell |authorlink=Haskell Curry |year=1951 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZHrBQgp1bkC 56] |isbn=978-0-444-53368-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal system]] is a set of symbols, or ''tokens'', and some ''rules'' on how the tokens are to be combined into ''formulas''. In formal systems, the word ''axiom'' has a special meaning different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth", and is used to refer to a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.&lt;ref name=Mura/&gt; There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science.&lt;ref name=Runge/&gt; Some just say, "Mathematics is what mathematicians do."&lt;ref name=Mura/&gt;

===Mathematics as science===

The German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".&lt;ref name="Waltershausen"&gt;Waltershausen, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has called mathematics "the Queen of Science&amp;nbsp;... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicolas Bourbaki |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |access-date=26 October 2017 |series=A Brief History of Mathematics |first=Marcus |last=du Sautoy |station=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2010 |time=min. 12:50 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216050402/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |archivedate=December 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] observed that "most mathematical theories are, like those of [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[hypothesis|hypothetico]]-[[deductive]]: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."&lt;ref&gt;Popper 1995, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Popper also noted that "I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |year=2002 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=KZvXAAAAMAAJ 1959] |title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon-on-Thames |isbn=0-41527843-0 |page=[18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ..." in his ''History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|title=The science checklist applied: Mathematics|website=undsci.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027021023/https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|archive-date=October 27, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borel|first=Armand|date=March 2017|title=Mathematics: Art and Science|journal=EMS Newsletter|volume=3|issue=103|pages=37–45|doi=10.4171/news/103/8|issn=1027-488X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, [[land measurement]], architecture and later [[astronomy]]; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E.

Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".&lt;ref name=wigner1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |ref=harv |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].

For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical research often seeks critical features of a mathematical object. A theorem expressed as a [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the object by these features is the prize. Examples of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments has been published in ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]''.

The popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions. And at the other social extreme, philosophers continue to find problems in [[philosophy of mathematics]], such as the nature of [[mathematical proof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archivedate=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c–o–w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after – the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''."&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for "[[if and only if]]" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".

[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics&lt;!--This part needs improvement |&gt;&gt;--&gt;. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may be erroneous if the used computer program is erroneous.{{efn|For considering as reliable a large computation occurring in a proof, one generally requires two computations using independent software}}&lt;ref&gt;Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken–Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[proof assistant]]s allow verifying all details that cannot be given in a hand-written proof, and provide certainty of the correctness of long proofs such as that of the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]].{{efn|The book containing the complete proof has more than 1,000 pages.}}

[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|0-486-61630-4}}. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of mathematics==
{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}
[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|The [[abacus]] is a simple calculating tool used since ancient times.]]
Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

[[Discrete mathematics]] conventionally groups together the fields of mathematics which study mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.

===Foundations and philosophy===
In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Howard Hodgkin &amp; Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].

Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].

[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model—the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811193730/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

===Pure mathematics===
{{main|Pure mathematics}}

====Quantity====
{{Main|Arithmetic}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.

As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s ("[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of "[[infinity]]". According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

====Structure====
{{Main|Algebra}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Many mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].

By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

====Space====
{{Main|Geometry}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of space originates with [[geometry]]—in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proven only with the help of computers.

====Change====
{{Main|Calculus}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.

===Applied mathematics===
{{Main|Applied mathematics}}
[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and [[industry]]. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized [[knowledge]]. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.

In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].

====Statistics and other decision sciences====
{{Main|Statistics}}
Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];&lt;ref&gt;[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]—with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}

[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.&lt;ref name="RaoOpt"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |authorlink=C.R.

====Computational mathematics====
[[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization|discretisation]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].

==Mathematical awards==
Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: "The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics."}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778–82}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.

A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward. Currently, only one of these problems, the [[Poincaré Conjecture]], has been solved.

      <text bytes="16142" xml:space="preserve">'''Data-driven control systems''' are a broad family of [[Control theory|control systems]], in which the [[System identification|identification]] of the process model and/or the design of the controller are based entirely on ''experimental data'' collected from the plant &lt;ref&gt;Bazanella, A.S., Campestrini, L., Eckhard, D. (2012). Data-driven controller design: the &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; approach. Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-007-2300-9}}, 208 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In many control applications, trying to write a mathematical model of the plant is considered a hard task, requiring efforts and time to the process and control engineers. This problem is overcome by ''data-driven'' methods, which allow to fit a system model to the experimental data collected, choosing it in a specific models class. The control engineer can then exploit this model to design a proper controller for the system. However, it is still difficult to find a simple yet reliable model for a physical system, that includes only those dynamics of the system that are of interest for the control specifications. The ''direct'' data-driven methods allow to tune a controller, belonging to a given class, without the need of an identified model of the system. In this way, one can also simply weight process dynamics of interest inside the control cost function, and exclude those dynamics that are out of interest.

== Overview ==

The ''standard'' approach to control systems design is organized in two-steps: 
# Model identification aims at estimating a nominal model of the system &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} = G\left(q; \widehat{\theta}_N\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the unit-delay operator (for discrete-time transfer functions representation) and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}_N&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of parameters of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; identified on a set of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; data. Then, validation consists in constructing the ''uncertainty set'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; that contains the true system &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; at a certain probability level.
# Controller design aims at finding a controller &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; achieving closed-loop stability and meeting the required performance with &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Typical objectives of [[System Identification|system identification]] are to have &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; as close as possible to &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;, and to have &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; as small as possible. However, from an [[System identification#Identification for control|identification for control]] perspective, what really matters is the performance achieved by the controller, not the intrinsic quality of the model.

One way to deal with uncertainty is to design a controller that has an acceptable performance with all models in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, including &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is the main idea behind [[robust control]] design procedure, that aims at building frequency domain uncertainty descriptions of the process. However, being based on worst-case assumptions rather than on the idea of averaging out the noise, this approach typically leads to ''conservative'' uncertainty sets. Rather, data-driven techniques deal with uncertainty by working on experimental data, and avoiding excessive conservativism.

In the following, the main classifications of data-driven control systems are presented.

=== Indirect and direct methods ===
There are many methods available to control the systems. 
The fundamental distinction is between '''indirect''' and '''direct''' controller design methods. The former group of techniques is still retaining the standard two-step approach, ''i.e.'' first a model is identified, then a controller is tuned based on such model. The main issue in doing so is that the controller is computed from the estimated model &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; (according to the [[Stochastic control#Certainty equivalence|certainty equivalence]] principle), but in practice &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} \neq G_0&lt;/math&gt;. To overcome this problem, the idea behind the latter group of techniques is to map the experimental data ''directly'' onto the controller, without any model to be identified in between.

=== Iterative and noniterative methods ===

Another important distinction is between '''iterative''' and '''noniterative''' (or '''one-shot''') methods. In the former group, repeated iterations are needed to estimate the controller parameters, during which the [[optimization problem]] is performed based on the results of the previous iteration, and the estimation is expected to become more and more accurate at each iteration. This approach is also prone to on-line implementations (see below). In the latter group, the (optimal) controller parametrization is provided with a single optimization problem. This is particularly important for those systems in which iterations or repetitions of data collection experiments are limited or even not allowed (for example, due to economic aspects). In such cases, one should select a design technique capable of delivering a controller on a single data set. This approach is often implemented off-line (see below).

=== On-line and off-line methods ===

Since, on practical industrial applications, open-loop or closed-loop data are often available continuously, '''on-line''' data-driven techniques use those data to improve the quality of the identified model and/or the performance of the controller each time new information is collected on the plant. Instead, '''off-line''' approaches work on batch of data, which may be collected only once, or multiple times at a regular (but rather long) interval of time.

== Iterative feedback tuning ==

The iterative feedback tuning (IFT) method was introduced in 1994 &lt;ref&gt;Hjalmarsson, H., Gevers, M., Gunnarsson, S., &amp; Lequin, O. (1998). Iterative feedback tuning: theory and applications. IEEE control systems, 18(4), 26–41.&lt;/ref&gt;, starting from the observation that, in identification for control, each iteration is based on the (wrong) certainty equivalence principle.

IFT is a model-free technique for the direct iterative optimization of the parameters of a fixed-order controller; such parameters can be successively updated using information coming from standard (closed-loop) system operation.

Let &lt;math&gt;y^d&lt;/math&gt; be a desired output to the reference signal &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; the error between the achieved and desired response is &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}(\rho)=y(\rho)-y^d&lt;/math&gt;. The control design objective can be formulated as the minimization of the objective function:

:&lt;math&gt; J(\rho) = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{t=1}^N E\left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)^2\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Given the objective function to minimize, the ''quasi-Newton method'' can be applied, i.e. a gradient-based minimization using a gradient search of the type:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_{i+1} = \rho_i - \gamma_i R_i^{-1}  \frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}(\rho_i). &lt;/math&gt;

The value &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the step size, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate positive definite matrix and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation of the gradient; the true value of the gradient is given by the following:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dJ}{d\rho} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained through the following three-step methodology:

# Normal Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as reference; collect N measurements of the output &lt;math&gt;y(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(1)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Gradient Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and 0 as reference &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; inject the signal &lt;math&gt;r-y^{(1)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt; such that it is summed to the control variable output by &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, going as input into the plant. Collect the output, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(2)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Take the following as gradient approximation: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho) = \frac{\delta C}{\delta \rho} (\rho) y^{(2)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

A crucial factor for the convergence speed of the algorithm is the choice of &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;; when &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; is small, a good choice is the approximation given by the Gauss–Newton direction:

: &lt;math&gt; R_i = \frac 1 N \sum_{t=1}^N \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i) \frac{\delta \widehat{y}^T}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i).&lt;/math&gt;

== Noniterative correlation-based tuning ==

Noniterative correlation-based tuning (nCbT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller&lt;ref&gt;van Heusden, K., Karimi, A. and Bonvin, D. (2011), Data-driven model reference control with asymptotically guaranteed stability. Int. J. Adapt. Control Signal Process., 25: 331–351. {{doi|10.1002/acs.1212}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denotes an unknown LTI stable SISO plant, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined reference model and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined weighting function. An LTI fixed-order controller is indicated as &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)=\beta^T \rho&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \rho \in \mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of LTI basis functions. Finally, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal LTI controller of any structure, guaranteeing a closed-loop function &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; when applied to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The goal is to minimize the following objective function:

: &lt;math&gt;J(\rho)=\left\| F \bigg( \frac{ K^* G-K(\rho)G }{ (1+K^* G)^2 } \bigg) \right\|_2^2. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;J(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is a convex approximation of the objective function obtained from a model reference problem, supposing that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ (1+K(\rho)G) } \approx \frac{1}{ (1+K^*G) }&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is stable and minimum-phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the scheme in figure.

[[File:Noniterative Correlation-based Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The idea is that, when ''G'' is stable and minimum phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The input signal &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; is supposed to be a persistently exciting input signal and &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be generated by a stable data-generation mechanism. The two signals are thus uncorrelated in an open-loop experiment; hence, the ideal error &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The control objective thus consists in finding &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; are uncorrelated.

The vector of ''instrumental variables'' &lt;math&gt;\zeta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta(t)=[r_W (t+\ell_1 ),r_W (t+\ell_1-1),\ldots,r_W (t),\ldots,r_W (t-\ell_1) ]^T &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; is large enough and &lt;math&gt;r_W (t)=Wr(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate filter.

The correlation function is:

: &lt;math&gt;f_{N,\ell_1} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \zeta(t) \varepsilon(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

and the optimization problem becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho} = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} f_{N,\ell_1}^T f_{N,\ell_1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting with &lt;math&gt;\phi_r (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;, it can be demonstrated that, under some assumptions, if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is selected as:

:&lt;math&gt;W(e^{-j\omega}) = \frac{F(e^{-j\omega})(1-M(e^{-j\omega}))}{\phi_r (\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;

then, the following holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N,\ell_1 \to \infty, \ell_1/N \to \infty} \widehat{\rho} = \rho^*.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stability constraint ===

There is no guarantee that the controller &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;J_{N,\ell_1}&lt;/math&gt; is stable. Instability may occur in the following cases:

* If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is non-minimum phase, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; may lead to cancellations in the right-half complex plane.
* If &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; (even if stabilizing) is not achievable, &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be stabilizing.
* Due to measurement noise, even if &lt;math&gt;K^*=K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stabilizing, data-estimated &lt;math&gt;\widehat{K}(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be so.

Consider a stabilizing controller &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt; and the closed loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;M_s=\frac{K_s G}{1+K_s G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Define:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) := M_s - K(\rho) G (1-M_s) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\rho) := \left\| \Delta(\rho) \right\|_\infty. &lt;/math&gt;

:'''Theorem''' 
:''The controller &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes the plant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if

# &lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is stable
# &lt;math&gt;\exist \delta_N \in (0,1) &lt;/math&gt; s.t. &lt;math&gt; \delta (\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;''

Condition 1. is enforced when:

* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stable
* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; contains an integrator (it is canceled).

The model reference design with stability constraint becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_s = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J(\rho) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \text{s.t. } \delta(\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;

A '''convex data-driven estimation''' of &lt;math&gt;\delta(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained through the [[discrete Fourier transform]]. 

Define the following:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \widehat{R}_r (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) r(t) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2 \\[4pt]
&amp; \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) \varepsilon(t,\rho) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For '''stable minimum phase plants''', the following '''convex data-driven oprimization problem''' is given:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\rho} &amp; = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) \\[3pt]
&amp; \text{s.t.} \\[3pt]
&amp; \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \leq \delta_N \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_r (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \\[4pt]
\omega_k &amp; = \frac{2 \pi k}{2\ell_2+1}, \qquad k=0,\ldots,\ell_2+1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Virtual reference feedback tuning ==

Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

VRFT was first proposed in &lt;ref&gt;Campi, Marco C., Andrea Lecchini, and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Virtual reference feedback tuning: a direct method for the design of feedback controllers." Automatica 38.8 (2002): 1337–1346.&lt;/ref&gt; and then extended to LPV systems &lt;ref&gt;Formentin, S., Piga, D., Tóth, R., &amp; Savaresi, S. M. (2016). Direct learning of LPV controllers from data. Automatica, 65, 98–110.&lt;/ref&gt;. VRFT also builds on ideas given in &lt;ref&gt;Guardabassi, Guido O., and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Approximate feedback linearization of discrete-time non-linear systems using virtual input direct design." Systems &amp; Control Letters 32.2 (1997): 63–74.&lt;/ref&gt; as &lt;math&gt;VRD^2&lt;/math&gt;. 

The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)&lt;/math&gt; from the measured output signal &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model M and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference from the measured output signal y.]]

The virtual signals are &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)=M^{-1} y(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; e_v (t)=r_v (t) - y(t). &lt;/math&gt;

The optimal controller is obtained from noiseless data by solving the following optimization problem:

: &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho}_\infty = \underset{\rho}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \lim_{N \to \infty} J_{vr} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

where the optimization function is given as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; J_{vr}^N (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left(u(t)-K(\rho) e_v(t) \right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The society hosts regular talks at the [[Centre for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge)|Centre for Mathematical Sciences]], including in the past by many well-known speakers in the field of mathematics. It publishes two magazines, [[Eureka (University of Cambridge magazine)|''Eureka'']] and ''QARCH''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://the-archimedeans.org.uk/|title=The Archimedeans|website=the-archimedeans.org.uk|access-date=2019-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of several aims of the society, as laid down in its constitution, is to encourage co-operation between the existing mathematical societies of individual [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|Cambridge colleges]], which at present are just the Adam's society of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] and the [[Trinity Mathematical Society]], but in the past have included many more.

The society is mentioned in [[G. H. Hardy]]'s essay [[A Mathematician's Apology]].

Past presidents of The Archimedeans include [[Michael Atiyah]] and [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]].

== Activity ==
The main focus of the society's activities are the regular talks, which generally concern topics from mathematics or theoretical physics, and are accessible to students on an undergraduate level. Among the list of recent speakers are [[Fields Medal|Fields medalists]] [[Michael Atiyah]], [[Wendelin Werner]] and [[Alain Connes]], as well as authors [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Simon Singh]]. Many of the speakers are international, and are hosted by The Archimedeans during their visit.

After exams and University-wide project deadlines, the society is also known to organise social events.

== Publications ==
''Eureka'' is a mathematical journal that is published annually by The Archimedeans. It includes articles on a variety of topics in mathematics, written by students and academics from all over the world, as well as a short summary of the activities of the society, [[Problem set|problem sets]], puzzles, artwork and book reviews. The magazine has been published 60 times since 1939, and authors include many famous mathematicians and scientists such as [[Paul Erdős]], [[Martin Gardner]], [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Godfrey Hardy]], [[Béla Bollobás]], [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Roger Penrose]], [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], Fields Medallist [[Timothy Gowers]] and [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Paul Dirac]].

The journal is distributed free of charge to all current members of the Archimedeans. In addition, there are many subscriptions by other students, alumni and libraries. Subscriptions to ''Eureka'' are the society's main source of income.

The Archimedeans also publish ''QARCH'', a magazine containing problem sets and solutions or partial solutions submitted by readers. It is published on an irregular basis and distributed free of charge.

      <text bytes="28183" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], '''analysis of Boolean functions''' is the study of real-valued functions on &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; (such functions are sometimes known as [[pseudo-Boolean function]]s) from a spectral perspective.&lt;ref name="ODonnell14"&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Donnell|first=Ryan|date=2014|title=Analysis of Boolean functions|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03832-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functions studied are often, but not always, Boolean-valued, making them [[Boolean function]]s. The area has found many applications in [[combinatorics]], [[social choice theory]], [[random graph]]s, and theoretical computer science, especially in [[hardness of approximation]], [[property testing]], and [[probably approximately correct learning|PAC learning]].

==Basic concepts==
We will mostly consider functions defined on the domain &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes it is more convenient to work with the domain &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; instead. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then the corresponding function defined on &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;f_{01}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = f((-1)^{x_1},\ldots,(-1)^{x_n}).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for us a Boolean function is a &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;-valued function, though often it is more convenient to consider &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;-valued functions instead.

===Fourier expansion===
Every real-valued function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; has a unique expansion as a multilinear polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S(x), \quad \chi_S(x) = \prod_{i \in S} x_i. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Hadamard transform]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[Fourier transform]] in the [[group (mathematics)|group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2^n&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficients &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S)&lt;/math&gt; are known as ''Fourier coefficients'', and the entire sum is known as the ''Fourier expansion'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The functions &lt;math&gt;\chi_S&lt;/math&gt; are known as ''Fourier characters'', and they form an orthonormal basis for the space of all functions over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to the inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle f,g \rangle = 2^{-n} \sum_{x \in \{-1,1\}^n} f(x) g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Fourier coefficients can be calculated using an inner product:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{f}(S) = \langle f, \chi_S \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, this shows that &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(\emptyset) = \operatorname{E}[f].&lt;/math&gt; Parseval's identity states that

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|^2 = \operatorname{E}[f^2] = \sum_S \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

If we skip &lt;math&gt;S = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, then we get the variance of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}[f] = \sum_{S \neq \emptyset} \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Fourier degree and Fourier levels ===
The ''degree'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for some set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the degree of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is its degree as a multilinear polynomial.

It is convenient to decompose the Fourier expansion into ''levels'': the Fourier coefficient &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S)&lt;/math&gt; is on level &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;'' part of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; f^{=d} = \sum_{|S| = d} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S. &lt;/math&gt;

It is obtained from &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by zeroing out all Fourier coefficients not on level &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

We similarly define &lt;math&gt;f^{&gt;d},f^{&lt;d},f^{\geq d},f^{\leq d}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Influence===
The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th influence of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in two equivalent ways:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \operatorname{E}\left[ \left(\frac{f - f^{\oplus i}}{2} \right)^2 \right] = \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2, \\[5pt]
&amp; f^{\oplus i}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = f(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},-x_i,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f]&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that flipping the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate flips the value of the function:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \Pr[f(x) \neq f^{\oplus i}(x)]. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; doesn't depend on the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate.

The ''total influence'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all of its influences:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \sum_S |S| \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The total influence of a Boolean function is also the ''average sensitivity'' of the function. The ''sensitivity'' of a Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at a given point is the number of coordinates &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; such that if we flip the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate, the value of the function changes. The average value of this quantity is exactly the total influence.

The total influence can also be defined using the [[Discrete Laplace operator#Graph Laplacians|discrete Laplacian]] of the [[Hamming graph]], suitably normalized:  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \langle f,Lf \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The Sensitivity conjecture : There exists an absolute constant C &gt; 0, such that for every boolean function f,
           Block Sensitivity  bs(f) ≤ Sensitivity s(f}&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. 

was confirmed by Hao Huang &lt;ref&gt;Induced subgraphs of hypercubes and a proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture, Huang Hao, 19 August 2019, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00847.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Decades-old computer Science Conjecture Solved in Two Pages,Quanta Magazine, 2019 February, https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Noise stability===
Given &lt;math&gt;-1 \leq \rho \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, we say that two random vectors &lt;math&gt;x,y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; are ''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated'' if the marginal distributions of &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; are uniform, and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[x_iy_i] = \rho&lt;/math&gt;. Concretely, we can generate a pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated random variables by first choosing &lt;math&gt;x,z \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random, and then choosing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; according to one of the following two equivalent rules, applied independently to each coordinate:

:&lt;math&gt; y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \rho, \\ z_i &amp; \text{w.p. } 1-\rho. \end{cases} \quad \text{or} \quad y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \frac{1+\rho}{2}, \\ -x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \frac{1-\rho}{2}. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

We denote this distribution by &lt;math&gt; y \sim N_\rho(x) &lt;/math&gt;.

The ''noise stability'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in two equivalent ways:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] = \operatorname{E}_{x; y \sim N_\rho(x)}[f(x) f(y)] = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \delta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the ''noise sensitivity'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{NS}_\delta[f] = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{Stab}_{1-2\delta}[f]. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean, then this is the probability that the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; changes if we flip each coordinate with probability &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, independently.

===Noise operator===
The ''noise operator'' &lt;math&gt;T_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is an operator taking a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and returning another function &lt;math&gt;T_\rho f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt; (T_\rho f)(x) = \operatorname{E}_{y \sim N_\rho(x)}[f(y)] = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S. &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\rho &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the noise operator can also be defined using a [[continuous-time Markov chain]] in which each bit is flipped independently with rate 1. The operator &lt;math&gt;T_\rho&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to running this Markov chain for &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\log\frac{1}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; steps starting at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and taking the average value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at the final state. This Markov chain is generated by the Laplacian of the Hamming graph, and this relates total influence to the noise operator.

Noise stability can be defined in terms of the noise operator: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] = \langle f, T_\rho f \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

===Hypercontractivity===
For &lt;math&gt;1 \leq q &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Lp space#Lp spaces|&lt;math&gt;L_q&lt;/math&gt;-norm]] of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_q = \sqrt[q]{\operatorname{E}[|f|^q]}. &lt;/math&gt;

We also define &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_\infty = \max_{x \in \{-1,1\}^n} |f(x)|.&lt;/math&gt;

The hypercontractivity theorem states that for any &lt;math&gt;q &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q' = 1/(1-1/q)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \|T_\rho f\|_q \leq \|f\|_2 \quad \text{and} \quad \|T_\rho f\|_2 \leq \|f\|_{q'}. &lt;/math&gt;

Hypercontractivity is closely related to the [[logarithmic Sobolev inequalities]] of [[functional analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diaconis|first1=Persi|last2=Saloff-Coste|first2=Laurent|date=1996|title=Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for finite Markov chains|journal= [[Annals of Applied Probability]] |volume=6|number=3|pages=695–750|doi=10.1214/aoap/1034968224|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar result for &lt;math&gt;q &lt; 2&lt;/math&gt; is known as ''reverse hypercontractivity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mossel|first1=Elchanan|last2=Oleszkiewicz|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Sen|first3=Arnab|date=2013|title=On reverse hypercontractivity|journal=GAFA|volume=23|number=3|pages=1062–1097|doi=10.1007/s00039-013-0229-4|arxiv=1108.1210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''p''-Biased analysis===

In many situations the input to the function is not uniformly distributed over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, but instead has a bias toward &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. In these situations it is customary to consider functions over the domain &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; p &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, the ''p''-biased measure &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_p(x) = p^{\sum_i x_i} (1-p)^{\sum_i (1-x_i)}. &lt;/math&gt;

This measure can be generated by choosing each coordinate independently to be 1 with probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and 0 with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;.

The classical Fourier characters are no longer orthogonal with respect to this measure. Instead, we use the following characters:

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_S(x) = \left(\sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}\right)^{|\{i \in S : x_i = 0\}|} \left(-\sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p}}\right)^{|\{i \in S : x_i = 1\}|}. &lt;/math&gt;

The ''p''-biased Fourier expansion of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the expansion of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of ''p''-biased characters:

:&lt;math&gt; f = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \omega_S. &lt;/math&gt;

We can extend the definitions of influence and the noise operator to the ''p''-biased setting by using their spectral definitions.

====Influence====
The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'s influence is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2 = p(1-p) \operatorname{E}[(f-f^{\oplus i})^2]. &lt;/math&gt;

The total influence is the sum of the individual influences:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{Inf}_i[f].&lt;/math&gt;

====Noise operator====
A pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated random variables can be obtained by choosing &lt;math&gt;x,z \sim \mu_p&lt;/math&gt; independently and &lt;math&gt;y \sim N_\rho(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \rho, \\ z_i &amp; \text{w.p. } 1-\rho. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The noise operator is then given by

:&lt;math&gt; (T_\rho f)(x) = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S) \omega_S(x) = \operatorname{E}_{y \sim N_\rho(x)} [f(y)]. &lt;/math&gt;

Using this we can define the noise stability and the noise sensitivity, as before.

====Russo–Margulis formula====
The Russo–Margulis formula (also called the Margulis–Russo formula&lt;ref name="ODonnell14" /&gt;) states that for monotone Boolean functions &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dp} \operatorname{E}_{x \sim \mu_p} [f(x)] = \frac{\operatorname{Inf}[f]}{p(1-p)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \Pr[f \neq f^{\oplus i}]. &lt;/math&gt;

Both the influence and the probabilities are taken with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt;, and on the right-hand side we have the average sensitivity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If we think of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a property, then the formula states that as &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; varies, the derivative of the probability that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; occurs at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; equals the average sensitivity at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

The Russo–Margulis formula is key for proving sharp threshold theorems such as [[#Friedgut's sharp threshold theorem|Friedgut's]].

===Gaussian space===
One of the deepest results in the area, the [[#Invariance principle|invariance principle]], connects the distribution of functions on the Boolean cube &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; to their distribution on ''Gaussian space'', which is the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; endowed with the standard &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Gaussian measure]].

Many of the basic concepts of Fourier analysis on the Boolean cube have counterparts in Gaussian space:

* The counterpart of the Fourier expansion in Gaussian space is the Hermite expansion, which is an expansion to an infinite sum (converging in &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;) of multivariate [[Hermite polynomials]].
* The counterpart of total influence or average sensitivity for the indicator function of a set is Gaussian surface area, which is the Minkowski content of the boundary of the set.
* The counterpart of the noise operator is the [[Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process|Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator]] (related to the [[Mehler kernel|Mehler transform]]), given by &lt;math&gt;(U_\rho f)(x) = \operatorname{E}_{z \sim N(0,1)}[f(\rho x + \sqrt{1-\rho^2}z)]&lt;/math&gt;, or alternatively by &lt;math&gt;(U_\rho f)(x) = \operatorname{E}[f(y)]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; is a pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated standard Gaussians.
* Hypercontractivity holds (with appropriate parameters) in Gaussian space as well.

Gaussian space is more symmetric than the Boolean cube (for example, it is rotation invariant), and supports continuous arguments which may be harder to get through in the discrete setting of the Boolean cube. The invariance principle links the two settings, and allows deducing results on the Boolean cube from results on Gaussian space.

==Basic results==
===Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem===
If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; has degree at most 1, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is either constant, equal to a coordinate, or equal to the negation of a coordinate. In particular, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a ''dictatorship'': a function depending on at most one coordinate.

The Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedgut |first1=Ehud |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |last3=Naor |first3=Assaf |date=2002 |title=Boolean functions whose Fourier transform is concentrated on the first two levels |journal= [[Advances in Applied Mathematics]] |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=427–437 |doi=10.1016/S0196-8858(02)00024-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the ''FKN theorem'', states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ''almost'' has degree 1 then it is ''close'' to a dictatorship. Quantitatively, if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|f^{&gt;1}\|^2 &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a dictatorship, that is, &lt;math&gt;\|f - g\|^2 = O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; for some Boolean dictatorship &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\Pr[f \neq g] = O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; for some Boolean dictatorship &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, a Boolean function of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; depends on at most &lt;math&gt;C_{W}2^{d}&lt;/math&gt; coordinates, making it a ''junta'' (a function depending on a constant number of coordinates), where &lt;math&gt;C_{W}&lt;/math&gt; is an absolute constant equal to at least 1.5, and at most 4.41, as shown by Wellens. The Kindler–Safra theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kindler |first=Guy |date=2002 |title=Property testing, PCP, and juntas |chapter=16 |publisher=Tel Aviv University}}&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem to this setting. It states that if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\|f^{&gt;d}\|^2 &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Boolean function of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

===Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem===
The Poincaré inequality for the Boolean cube (which follows from formulas appearing above) states that for a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[f] \leq \operatorname{Inf}[f] \leq \deg f \cdot \operatorname{Var}[f]. &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] \geq \frac{\operatorname{Var}[f]}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=The influence of variables on Boolean functions. |last1=Kahn |first1=Jeff |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |last3=Linial |first3=Nati |date=1988 |publisher=IEEE |book-title=Proc. 29th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |pages=68–80 |location=White Plains |conference=SFCS'88 |doi=10.1109/SFCS.1988.21923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the ''KKL theorem'', states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean then &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The bound given by the Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem is tight, and is achieved by the ''Tribes'' function of Ben-Or and Linial:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Collective coin flipping, robust voting schemes and minima of Banzhaf values |last1=Ben-Or |first1=Michael |last2=Linial |first2=Nathan |date=1985 |publisher=IEEE |book-title=Proc. 26th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |pages=408–416 |location=Portland, Oregon |conference=SFCS'85 |doi=10.1109/SFCS.1985.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (x_{1,1} \land \cdots \land x_{1,w}) \lor \cdots \lor (x_{2^w,1} \land \cdots \land x_{2^w,w}). &lt;/math&gt;

The Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem was one of the first results in the area, and was the one introducing hypercontractivity into the context of Boolean functions.

===Friedgut's junta theorem===
If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;-junta (a function depending on at most &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; coordinates) then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] \leq M&lt;/math&gt; according to the Poincaré inequality.

Friedgut's theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedgut |first=Ehud |date=1998 |title=Boolean functions with low average sensitivity depend on few coordinates |journal=Combinatorica |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=474–483 |doi=10.1007/PL00009809|citeseerx=10.1.1.7.5597 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a converse to this result. It states that for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Boolean junta depending on &lt;math&gt;\exp (\operatorname{Inf}[f]/\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; coordinates.

Combined with the Russo–Margulis lemma, Friedgut's junta theorem implies that for every &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, every monotone function is close to a junta with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu_q&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;q \approx p&lt;/math&gt;.

===Invariance principle===
The invariance principle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mossel |first1=Elchanan |last2=O'Donnell |first2=Ryan |last3=Oleszkiewicz |first3=Krzysztof |date=2010 |title=Noise stability of functions with low influences: Invariance and optimality |journal= [[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume=171 |issue=1 |pages=295–341 |doi=10.4007/annals.2010.171.295|arxiv=math/0503503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the [[Berry–Esseen theorem]] to non-linear functions.

The Berry–Esseen theorem states (among else) that if &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_i&lt;/math&gt; and no &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is too large compared to the rest, then the distribution of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is close to a normal distribution with the same mean and variance.

The invariance principle (in a special case) informally states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a multilinear polynomial of bounded degree over &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; and all influences of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are small, then the distribution of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; under the uniform measure over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is close to its distribution in Gaussian space.

More formally, let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be a univariate [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz function]], let &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;k=\deg f&lt;/math&gt;, and let
&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \max_i \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{S \neq \emptyset} \hat{f}(S)^2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt; \left| \operatorname{E}_{x \sim \{-1,1\}^n} [\psi(f(x))] - \operatorname{E}_{g \sim N(0,I)} [\psi(f(g))] \right| = O(k9^k \varepsilon). &lt;/math&gt;

By choosing appropriate &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, this implies that the distributions of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; under both measures are close in [[Cumulative distribution function|CDF distance]], which is given by &lt;math&gt;\sup_t |\Pr[f(x)&lt;t] - \Pr[f(g)&lt;t]|&lt;/math&gt;.

The invariance principle was the key ingredient in the original proof of the [[#Majority is Stablest|''Majority is Stablest'' theorem]].

==Some applications==
===Linearity testing===
A Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is ''linear'' if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;f(xy) = f(x)f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;xy = (x_1y_1,\ldots,x_ny_n)&lt;/math&gt;. It is not hard to show that the Boolean linear functions are exactly the characters &lt;math&gt;\chi_S&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[property testing]] we want to test whether a given function is linear. It is natural to try the following test: choose &lt;math&gt;x,y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random, and check that &lt;math&gt;f(xy) = f(x)f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is linear then it always passes the test. Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blum |first1=Manuel |last2=Luby |first2=Michael |last3=Rubinfeld |first3=Ronitt |date=1993 |title=Self-testing/correcting with applications to numerical problems |journal=J. Comput. Syst. Sci. |volume=47 |number=3 |pages=549–595 |doi=10.1016/0022-0000(93)90044-W}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that if the test passes with probability &lt;math&gt;1-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Fourier character. Their proof was combinatorial.

Bellare et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Bellare |first1=Mihir |last2=Coppersmith |first2=Don |last3=Håstad |first3=Johan |last4=Kiwi |first4=Marcos |last5=Sudan |first5=Madhu |date=1995 |title= Linearity testing in characteristic two |booktitle = Proc. 36th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |conference=FOCS'95}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an extremely simple Fourier-analytic proof, that also shows that if the test succeeds with probability &lt;math&gt;1/2 + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is correlated with a Fourier character. Their proof relies on the following formula for the success probability of the test:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S)^3. &lt;/math&gt;

===Arrow's theorem===
[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that for three and more candidates, the only unanimous voting rule for which there is always a [[Condorcet criterion|Condorcet winner]] is a dictatorship.

The usual proof of Arrow's theorem is combinatorial. Kalai&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalai |first=Gil |date=2002 |title=A Fourier-theoretic perspective on the Condorcet paradox and Arrow's theorem |journal=Adv. Appl. Math. |volume=29 |number=3 |pages=412–426 |doi=10.1016/S0196-8858(02)00023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an alternative proof of this result in the case of three candidates using Fourier analysis. If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is the rule that assigns a winner among two candidates given their relative orders in the votes, then the probability that there is a Condorcet winner given a uniformly random vote is &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} \operatorname{Stab}_{-1/3}[f]&lt;/math&gt;, from which the theorem easily follows.

The [[#Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem|FKN theorem]] implies that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a rule for which there is almost always a Condorcet winner, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is close to a dictatorship.

===Sharp thresholds===
A classical result in the theory of [[random graph]]s states that the probability that a &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; random graph is connected tends to &lt;math&gt;e^{-e^{-c}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;p \sim \frac{\log n + c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This is an example of a ''sharp threshold'': the width of the "threshold window", which is &lt;math&gt;O(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;, is asymptotically smaller than the threshold itself, which is roughly &lt;math&gt;\frac{\log n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, the probability that a &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; graph contains a triangle tends to &lt;math&gt;e^{-c^3/6}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;p \sim \frac{c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Here both the threshold window and the threshold itself are &lt;math&gt;\Theta(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;, and so this is a ''coarse threshold''.

Friedgut's sharp threshold theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedgut |first=Ehud |date=1999 |title=Sharp thresholds of graph properties and the k-SAT problem |journal=J. Am. Math. Soc. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=1017–1054 |doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-99-00305-7|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; states, roughly speaking, that a monotone graph property (a graph property is a property which doesn't depend on the names of the vertices) has a sharp threshold unless it is correlated with the appearance of small subgraphs. This theorem has been widely applied to analyze random graphs and [[percolation]].

On a related note, the [[#Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem|KKL theorem]] implies that the width of threshold window is always at most &lt;math&gt;O(1/\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedgut |first1=Ehud |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |date=1996 |title=Every monotone graph property has a sharp threshold |journal= Proc.

===Majority is stablest===
Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Maj}_n\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; denote the majority function on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; coordinates. Sheppard's formula gives the asymptotic noise stability of majority:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[\operatorname{Maj}_n] \longrightarrow 1 - \frac{2}{\pi} \arccos \rho. &lt;/math&gt;

This is related to the probability that if we choose &lt;math&gt;x \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random and form &lt;math&gt;y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; by flipping each bit of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1-\rho}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, then the majority stays the same:
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[\operatorname{Maj}_n] = 2\Pr[\operatorname{Maj}_n(x) = \operatorname{Maj}_n(y)]-1&lt;/math&gt;.

There are Boolean functions with larger noise stability. For example, a dictatorship &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; has noise stability &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

The Majority is Stablest theorem states, informally, then the only functions having noise stability larger than majority have influential coordinates. Formally, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\tau &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; has expectation zero and &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] \leq \tau&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] \leq 1 - \frac{2}{\pi} \arccos \rho + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

The first proof of this theorem used the [[#Invariance principle|invariance principle]] in conjunction with an isoperimetric theorem of Borell in Gaussian space; since then more direct proofs were devised.

Majority is Stablest implies that the [[Semidefinite programming#Example 3 .28Goemans-Williamson MAX CUT approximation algorithm.29|Goemans–Williamson approximation algorithm]] for [[Maximum cut|MAX-CUT]] is optimal, assuming the [[unique games conjecture]].

In [[mathematic]]s and [[political science]], the '''quota rule''' describes a desired property of a [[proportional representation|proportional]] [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment]] or [[electoral system|election]] method. It states that the number of seats that should be allocated to a given party should be between the upper or lower roundings (called upper and lower quotas) of its fractional proportional share (called natural quota).&lt;ref name="maa"&gt;Michael J. Caulfield. [https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/apportioning-representatives-in-the-united-states-congress-the-quota-rule "Apportioning Representatives in the United States Congress - The Quota Rule"]. MAA Publications. Retrieved October 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, if a party deserves 10.56 seats out of 15, the quota rule states that when the seats are allotted, the party may get 10 or 11 seats, but not lower or higher. Many common election methods, such as all [[highest averages method]]s, violate the quota rule.

==Mathematics==
If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the population of the party, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the total population, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the number of available seats, then the natural quota for that party (the number of seats the party would ideally get) is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac P T \cdot S&lt;/math&gt;

The lower quota is then the natural quota rounded down to the nearest [[integer]] while the upper quota is the natural quota rounded up. The quota rule states that the only two allocations that a party can receive should be either the lower or upper quota.&lt;ref name="maa"/&gt; If at any time an allocation gives a party a greater or lesser number of seats than the upper or lower quota, that allocation (and by extension, the method used to allocate it) is said to be in violation of the quota rule. Another way to state this is to say that a given method only satisfies the quota rule if each party's allocation differs from its natural quota by less than one, where each party's allocation is an integer value.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Stein. [http://www.math.uconn.edu/~stein/math103/Slides/math103-02.pdf Apportionment Methods] Retrieved December 9, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
If there are 5 available seats in the council of a club with 300 members, and party ''A'' has 106 members, then the natural quota for party ''A'' is &lt;math&gt; \frac {106} {300} \cdot 5 \approx 1.8&lt;/math&gt;. The lower quota for party ''A'' is 1, because 1.8 rounded down equal 1. The upper quota, 1.8 rounded up, is 2. Therefore, the quota rule states that the only two allocations allowed for party ''A'' are 1 or 2 seats on the council. If there is a second party, ''B'', that has 137 members, then the quota rule states that party ''B'' gets &lt;math&gt; \frac {137} {300} \cdot 5 \approx 2.3&lt;/math&gt;, rounded up and down equals either 2 or 3 seats. Finally, a party ''C'' with the remaining 57 members of the club has a natural quota of &lt;math&gt; \frac {57} {300} \cdot 5 \approx 0.95&lt;/math&gt;, which means its allocated seats should be either 0 or 1. In all cases, the method for actually allocating the seats determines whether an allocation violates the quota rule, which in this case would mean giving party ''A'' any seats other than 1 or 2, giving party ''B'' any other than 2 or 3, or giving party ''C'' any other than 0 or 1 seat.

===Relation to apportionment paradoxes===
The [[Apportionment_paradox#Balinski–Young_theorem|Balinski–Young theorem]] proved in 1980 that if an apportionment method satisfies the quota rule, it must fail to satisfy some [[apportionment paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Beth-Allyn Osikiewicz, Ph.D. [http://www.personal.kent.edu/~bosikiew/Math11008/imposs-apportion.pdf  Impossibilities of Apportionment] Retrieved October 23, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, although [[Largest remainder method|Hamilton's method]] satisfies the quota rule, it violates the [[Alabama paradox]] and the [[population paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren D. Smith. (2007).[https://rangevoting.org/Apportion.html Apportionment and rounding schemes] Retrieved October 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem itself is broken up into several different proofs that cover a wide number of circumstances.&lt;ref name="Balinski"&gt;M.L. Balinski and H.P. Young. (1980). [http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/1338/1/WP-80-131.pdf "The Theory of Apportionment"]. Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, there are two main statements that apply to the quota rule:
*Any method that follows the quota rule must fail the population paradox.&lt;ref name="Balinski"/&gt;
*Any method that is free of both the Alabama paradox and the population paradox must necessarily fail the quota rule for some circumstances.&lt;ref name="Balinski"/&gt;

==Use in apportionment methods==
Different methods for allocating seats may or may not satisfy the quota rule. While many methods do violate the quota rule, it is sometimes preferable to violate the rule very rarely than to violate some other apportionment paradox; some sophisticated methods violate the rule so rarely that it has not ever happened in a real apportionment, while some methods that never violate the quota rule violate other paradoxes in much more serious fashions.

[[Hamilton's method]] does satisfy the quota rule. The method works by proportioning seats equally until a fractional value is reached; the surplus seats are then given to the state with the largest fractional parts until there are no more surplus seats. Because it is impossible to give more than one surplus seat to a state, every state will always get either its lower or upper quota.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Freeman. [http://www.math.colostate.edu/~freeman/m130/apportionment1.pdf "Apportionment"]. Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jefferson's method]], which was one of the first used by the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.cas.uab.edu/~jcmayer/Apportionment%202.pdf "Apportionment 2"] Retrieved October 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes violated the quota rule by allocating more seats than the upper quota allowed.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.math.colostate.edu/~spriggs/m130/apportionment2.pdf Jefferson’s Method] Retrieved October 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This violation led to a growing problem where larger states receive more representatives than smaller states, which was not corrected until [[Webster/Sainte-Laguë method|Webster's method]] was implemented in 1842; even though Webster's method does violate the quota rule, it happens extremely rarely.&lt;ref&gt;Ghidewon Abay Asmerom.

In [[numerical analysis]], the '''Peano kernel theorem''' is a general result on error bounds for a wide class of numerical approximations (such as [[numerical quadrature|numerical quadratures]]), defined in terms of [[linear functionals]]. It is attributed to [[Giuseppe Peano]].&lt;ref name="Ridgway Scott 2011"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Numerical analysis|last=Ridgway Scott|first=L.|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691146867|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=209|oclc=679940621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement of theorem ==
Let  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; be the space of all [[differentiable function]]s &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined for &lt;math&gt;x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; that are of [[bounded variation]] on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be a [[linear functional]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\nu+1&lt;/math&gt; times [[continuously differentiable]] and that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; ''annihilates'' all polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;\leq \nu&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.&lt;math display="block"&gt;Lp=0,\qquad \forall p\in\mathbb{P}_\nu[x].&lt;/math&gt;Suppose further that for any [[bivariate function]] &lt;math&gt;g(x,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g(x,\cdot),\,g(\cdot,\theta)\in C^{\nu+1}[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, the following is valid:&lt;math display="block"&gt;L\int_a^bg(x,\theta)\,d\theta=\int_a^bLg(x,\theta)\,d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;and define the '''Peano kernel''' of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; as&lt;math display="block"&gt;k(\theta)=L[(x-\theta)^\nu_+],\qquad\theta\in[a,b],&lt;/math&gt;introducing notation&lt;math display="block"&gt;(x-\theta)^\nu_+ = \begin{cases} (x-\theta)^\nu, &amp; x\geq\theta, \\ 0, &amp; x\leq\theta. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;The ''Peano kernel theorem'' then states that &lt;math display="block"&gt;Lf=\frac{1}{\nu!}\int_a^bk(\theta)f^{(\nu+1)}(\theta)\,d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;provided &lt;math&gt;k\in\mathcal{V}[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ridgway Scott 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Iserles 2009"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A first course in the numerical analysis of differential equations|last=Iserles|first=Arieh|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521734905|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge|pages=443–444|oclc=277275036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bounds ===
Several bounds on the value of &lt;math&gt;Lf&lt;/math&gt; follow from this result:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
|Lf|&amp;\leq\frac{1}{\nu!}\|k\|_1\|f^{(\nu+1)}\|_\infty\\[5pt]
|Lf|&amp;\leq\frac{1}{\nu!}\|k\|_\infty\|f^{(\nu+1)}\|_1\\[5pt]
|Lf|&amp;\leq\frac{1}{\nu!}\|k\|_2\|f^{(\nu+1)}\|_2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_\infty&lt;/math&gt;are the [[Taxicab norm|taxicab]], [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean]] and [[Maximum norm|maximum]] [[Norm (mathematics)|norms]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Iserles 2009" /&gt;

== Application ==
In practice, the main application of the Peano kernel theorem is to bound the error of an approximation that is exact for all &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathbb{P}_\nu&lt;/math&gt;. The theorem above follows from the [[Taylor polynomial]] for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with integral remainder:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(x)=f(a) + {} &amp; (x-a)f'(a) + \frac{(x-a)^2}{2}f''(a)+\cdots \\[6pt]
&amp; \cdots+\frac{(x-a)^\nu}{\nu!}f^\nu(a)+
\frac{1}{\nu!}\int_a^x(x-a)^\nu f^{(\nu+1)}(\theta)\,d\theta,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

defining &lt;math&gt;L(f)&lt;/math&gt; as the error of the approximation, using the [[Linear map|linearity]] of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; together with exactness for &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathbb{P}_\nu&lt;/math&gt; to annihilate all but the final term on the right-hand side, and using the &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)_+&lt;/math&gt; notation to remove the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-dependence from the integral limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/examples/D3Ll.pdf|title=Numerical Analysis|last=Iserles|first=Arieh|date=1997|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of mathematics==
*[[Definitions of mathematics]] – Mathematics has no generally accepted definition. Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions, all of which are controversial.
*[[Philosophy of mathematics]] – its aim is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.

===Mathematics is===
*an [[academic discipline]] – branch of knowledge that is taught at all levels of education and researched typically at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
*a [[formal science]] – branch of knowledge concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules of inference. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world.

====Reference databases====
*''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' – journal and online database published by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) that contains brief synopses (and occasionally evaluations) of many articles in mathematics, statistics and theoretical computer science.
*''[[Zentralblatt MATH]]'' – service providing reviews and abstracts for articles in pure and applied mathematics, published by Springer Science+Business Media. It is a major international reviewing service which covers the entire field of mathematics. It uses the Mathematics Subject Classification codes for organizing their reviews by topic.

In mathematics, the '''permutation category'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trimble|loc=§ 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] where
# an object is a natural number,
# a morphism &lt;math&gt;n \to m&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n = m&lt;/math&gt; and is none otherwise.

It is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent as an category]] to the category of finite sets and bijections between them.

==History==
The theory of phase reduction method was first introduced in the 1950s, the existence of [[periodic solution]]s to nonlinear oscillators under [[wikt:perturbation|perturbation]], has been discussed by Malkin in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hoppensteadt F.C. and Izhikevich E.M |title=Weakly connected neural networks |publisher=Springer-Verlag, New York |volume=126 |date=1997 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-1828-9|series=Applied Mathematical Sciences |isbn=978-1-4612-7302-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s, Winfree illustrated the importance of the notion of phase and formulated the [[phase model]] for a population of nonlinear oscillators in his studies on biological synchronization.&lt;ref name "Winfree2001"&gt;{{cite book |author=Winfree A.T. |title=The Geometry of Biological Time |publisher=Springer, New York |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many researchers have discovered different rhythmic phenomena related to phase reduction theory.

== Phase model of reduction==
Consider the dynamical system of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x),  
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x\in \mathbb{R}^N&lt;/math&gt; is the oscillator state variable, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the baseline vector field. Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi:\mathbb{R}^N\times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N&lt;/math&gt; be the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] induced by the system, that is, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x_0,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of the system for the initial condition &lt;math&gt;x(0)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;. This system of differential equations can describe for a neuron model for conductance with &lt;math&gt; x=(V,n)\in \mathbb{R}^N&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; V&lt;/math&gt; represents the voltage difference across the membrane and &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt; represents the &lt;math&gt; (N-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector that defines [[gating variable]]s. &lt;ref name="BrownMoehlisHolmes"&gt;{{cite journal |author=E.Brown, J.Moehlis, P.Holmes |title=On the Phase Reduction and Response Dynamics of Neural Oscillator Populations |journal=Neural Computation |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=673–715 |date=2004|doi=10.1162/089976604322860668 |pmid=15025826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a neuron is perturbed by a stimulus current, the dynamics of the perturbed system will no longer be the same with the dynamics of the baseline neural oscillator. 

[[File:Isochron-stable limit cycle.png|thumb|upright=2.1|Isochrons and a stable limit cycle of the planar system &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=x - y - x(x^2+y^2);  \dot{y}= x + y - y(x^2+y^2)&lt;/math&gt;. The system has a unique stable limit cycle (solid circle). Only isochrons corresponding to phases &lt;math&gt;nT/5, n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T=2\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the period of the orbit, are shown (dotted lines). Neighbouring trajectories (blue dotted curves) with different initial conditions are attracted to the cycle (except the origin).]]

The target here is to reduce the system by defining a [[Phase (waves)|phase]] for each point in some neighbourhood of the limit cycle. The allowance of sufficiently small perturbations (e.g. external forcing or stimulus effect to the system) might cause a large deviation of the phase, but the amplitude is perturbed slightly because of the attracting of the limit cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.Rosenblum and A.Pikovsky |title=Synchronization: from pendulum clocks to chaotic lasers and chemical oscillators |journal=Contemporary Physics |volume=44 |issue=5 |page=401–416 |date=2003|doi=10.1080/00107510310001603129 |bibcode=2003ConPh..44..401R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence we need to extend the definition of the phase to points in the neighborhood of the cycle by introducing the definition of [[asymptotic phase]] (or [[latent phase]]).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author-link= Winfree |date= 2001 |title= The Geometry of Biological Time|url= https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387989921 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-1-4757-3484-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This helps us to assign a phase to each point in the [[basin of attraction]] of a periodic orbit. The set of points in the basin of attraction of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; that share the same asymptotic phase &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[isochron]] (e.g. see [[:File:Isochron_limit_cycle.png|Figure 1]]), which were first introduced by Winfree.&lt;ref name="Winfree67"&gt;{{cite journal |author=A.T.Winfree |title=Biological rhythms and the behavior of populations of coupled oscillators |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=15–42 |date=1967|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90051-3 |pmid=6035757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Isochrons can be shown to exist for such a stable hyperbolic limit cycle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref name="Guckenkeimer"&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.Guckenkeimer |title=Isochrons and phaseless sets |journal= Journal of Mathematical Biology|volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=259–273 |date=1975|doi=10.1007/BF01273747 |pmid=28303309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So for all point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in some neighbourhood of the cycle, the evolution of the phase &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be given by the relation &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\varphi}{dt}=\omega &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[natural frequency]] of the oscillation.&lt;ref name="BrownMoehlisHolmes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schultheiss"&gt;{{cite book |author=N.W.Schultheiss|display-authors=etal|title = The Theory of Weakly Coupled Oscillators |journal=Springer Series in Computational Neuroscience |volume=6 |pages = 3–31 |date=2012 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-0739-3_1|isbn = 978-1-4614-0738-6 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.225.4260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[chain rule]] we then obtain an equation that govern the evolution of the phase of the neuron model is given by the phase model:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\varphi}{dt}=\nabla\Phi(x)\cdot f(x)=\omega,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\nabla\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the gradient of the phase function &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the vector of the neuron's state vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, for the derivation of this result, see &lt;ref name="Nakao"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BrownMoehlisHolmes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schultheiss"/&gt; This means that the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional system describing the oscillating neuron dynamics is then reduced to a simple one-dimensional phase equation. One can notice that, it is impossible to retrieve the full information of the oscillator &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from the phase &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; because 
&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not one-to-one mapping.&lt;ref name="Nakao"/&gt;

==Phase model with external forcing==
Consider now a [[weakly perturbed system]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=f(x)+\varepsilon g(t),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the baseline vector field, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon g(t) &lt;/math&gt; is a weak periodic external forcing (or stimulus effect) of period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, which can be different from &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; (in general), and frequency &lt;math&gt;\Omega=2\pi/T &lt;/math&gt;, which might depend on the oscillator state &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that the baseline neural oscillator (that is, when &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=0&lt;/math&gt;)  has an [[exponentially stable]] [[limit cycle]] &lt;math&gt; \gamma&lt;/math&gt; with period &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; (example, see [[:File:Isochron-stable_limit_cycle.png|Figure 1]]) &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; that is [[normally hyperbolic]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= J.Guckenheimer and P.Holmes |title=Nonlinear Oscillations, Dynamical Systems, and Bifurcations of Vector Fields |publisher=Springer, NY |date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; persists under small perturbations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=N.Fenichel |title=Persistence and smoothness of invariant manifolds for flows |journal=Indiana University Mathematics Journal |volume=21 |issue=3 |date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that for a small perturbation, the perturbed system will remain close to the limit cycle. Hence we assume that such a limit cycle always exists for each neuron.

The evolution of the perturbed system in terms of the isochrons is &lt;ref name="Kuramoto"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\varphi}{dt}=\omega +\varepsilon \, \nabla\Phi(x)\cdot g(t),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\nabla\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the gradient of the phase &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the vector of the neuron's state vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the stimulus effect driving the firing of the neuron as a function of time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. This phase equation is a [[partial differential equation]] (PDE).

For a sufficiently small &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, a reduced phase model evaluated on the limit cycle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; of the unperturbed system can be given by, up to the first order of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\varphi}{dt}=\omega + \varepsilon \, Z(\varphi) \cdot g(t),
&lt;/math&gt;
where function &lt;math&gt;Z(\varphi):=\nabla\Phi(\gamma(t))&lt;/math&gt; measures the normalized phase shift due to a small perturbation delivered at any point &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; on the limit cycle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, and is called the [[phase sensitivity function]] or infinitesimal [[phase response curve]]. &lt;ref name="Winfree67"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Kuramoto"&gt;{{cite book |author=Y.Kuramoto |title=Chemical oscillations, waves, and turbulence |publisher=Springer-Verlag, Berlin |volume=19 |date=1984 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-69689-3|series=Springer Series in Synergetics |isbn=978-3-642-69691-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to analyze the reduced phase equation corresponding to the perturbed nonlinear system, we need to solve a PDE, which is not a trivial one. So we need to simplify it into an [[autonomous]] phase equation for &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, which can more easily be analyzed. &lt;ref name="Kuramoto"/&gt; Assuming that the frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; are sufficiently small so that
&lt;math&gt;\omega-\Omega=\varepsilon\delta &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, we can introduce a new phase function &lt;math&gt; \psi(t)=\varphi(t)-\Omega t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kuramoto"/&gt;

By the [[method of averaging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J.A.Sanders|display-authors=etal|title=Averaging methods in nonlinear dynamical systems |publisher=Springer-Verlag, New York |volume=59 |date=2010 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-48918-6|series=Applied Mathematical Sciences|isbn=978-0-387-48916-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;, assuming that &lt;math&gt;\psi(t)&lt;/math&gt; does not vary within &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain an approximated phase equation
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\psi(t)}{dt}=\Delta_\varepsilon + \varepsilon\Gamma(\psi),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\varepsilon=\varepsilon\delta &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\psi)&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;-periodic function representing the effect of the periodic external forcing on the oscillator phase,&lt;ref name="Kuramoto"/&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma(\psi)= \frac 1 {2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi}Z(\psi+\eta)\cdot g\left(\frac\eta\Omega\right) \, d\eta .
&lt;/math&gt; 
The graph of this function &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\psi)&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to exhibit the dynamics of the approximated phase model, for more illustrations see &lt;ref name="Nakao"/&gt;.

==Examples of phase reduction==
For a sufficiently small perturbation of a certain nonlinear oscillator or a network of coupled oscillators, we can compute the corresponding phase sensitivity function or infinitesimal PRC &lt;math&gt;Z(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''priority heuristic''' is a simple, lexicographic decision strategy that correctly predicts classic violations of [[expected utility theory]] such as the [[Allais paradox]], the four-fold pattern, the certainty effect, the possibility effect, or intransitivities.&lt;ref name="Brandstätter"&gt;Brandstätter, E., Gigerenzer, G., &amp; Hertwig, R. (2006). The priority heuristic: Making choices without trade-offs. Psychological Review, 113, 409–432.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The heuristic maps onto Rubinstein’s three-step-model, according to which people first check dominance and stop if it is present, otherwise they check for dissimilarity.&lt;ref name="Rubinstein"&gt;Rubinstein, A. (1988). Similarity and decision making under risk (Is there a utility resolution to the Allais-paradox?). Journal of Economic Theory, 46, 145–153.&lt;/ref&gt; To highlight Rubinstein’s model consider the following choice problem:

'''I:''' 50% chance to win 2,000&lt;br&gt;
:50% chance to win nothing

'''II:''' 52% chance to win 1,000&lt;br&gt;
:48% chance to win nothing

Dominance is absent, and while chances are similar monetary outcomes are not. Rubinstein’s model predicts that people check for dissimilarity and consequently choose Gamble I. Unfortunately, dissimilarity checks are often not decisive, and Rubinstein suggested that people, proceed to a third step that he left unspecified. The priority heuristic elaborates on Rubinstein’s framework by specifying this Step 3.

== Priority heuristic ==
For illustrative purposes consider a choice between two simple gambles of the type “a chance ''c'' of winning monetary amount ''x''; a chance (100 - ''c'') of winning amount ''y''.” A choice between two such gambles contains four reasons for choosing: the maximum gain, the minimum gain, and their respective chances; because chances are complementary, three reasons remain: the minimum gain, the chance of the minimum gain, and the maximum gain.

For choices between gambles in which all outcomes are positive or 0, the priority heuristic consists of the following three steps (for all other choices see Brandstätter et al. 2006):

'''Priority rule:''' Go through reasons in the order of minimum gain, chance of minimum gain, and maximum gain.

'''Stopping rule:''' Stop examination if the minimum gains differ by 1/10 (or more) of the maximum gain; otherwise, stop examination if chances differ by 10% (or more).

'''Decision rule:''' Choose the gamble with the more attractive gain (chance). The term “attractive” refers to the gamble with the higher (minimum or maximum) gain and to the lower chance of the minimum gain.

== Examples ==
Consider the following two choice problems, which were developed to support [[prospect theory]], not the priority heuristic.&lt;ref name="Kahneman"&gt;Kahneman, D., &amp; Tversky, A. (1979). Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. Econometrica, 47, 263–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Problem 1'''&lt;br&gt;
'''A:''' 80% chance to win 4,000&lt;br&gt;
:20% chance to win nothing
'''B:''' 100% chance to win 3,000

Most people chose B (80%). The priority heuristic starts by comparing the minimum gains of the Gambles A (0) and B (3,000). The difference is 3,000, which is larger than 400 (10% of the maximum gain), examination is stopped; and the heuristic predicts that people prefer the sure gain B, which is in fact the majority choice.&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Problem 2'''&lt;br&gt;
'''C:''' 45% chance to win 6,000&lt;br&gt;
:55% chance to win nothing
'''D:''' 90% chance to win 3,000 &lt;br&gt;
:10% chance to win nothing

Most people (86%) chose Gamble D. The priority heuristic starts by comparing the minimum gains (0 and 0). Because they do not differ, the probabilities (.45 and .90 or their logical complements .55 and .10) are compared. This difference is larger than 10%, examination stops and people are correctly predicted to choose D because of its higher probability of winning.

== Empirical support and limitations ==
The priority heuristic correctly predicted the majority choice in all (one-stage) gambles in Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Across four different data sets with a total of 260 problems, the heuristic predicted the majority choice better than (a) cumulative prospect theory, (b) two other modifications of expected utility theory, and (c) ten well-known heuristics (such as minimax or equal-weight) did.&lt;ref name="Brandstätter" /&gt; However, the priority heuristic fails to predict many simple decisions (that are typically not tested in experiments)&lt;ref&gt;Rieger, M. &amp; Wang, M. (2008). What is behind the Priority Heuristic? – A mathematical analysis and comment on Brandstätter, Gigerenzer and Hertwig. Psychological Review, 115, 1, 274-280.&lt;/ref&gt; and has no free parameters (which means that it cannot explain heterogeneity of decisions between subjects), which triggered criticism,&lt;ref name="Birnbaum"&gt;Birnbaum, M. H. (2008). Evaluation of the priority heuristic as a descriptive model of risky decision making: Comment on Brandstaätter, Gigerenzer, and Hertwig (2006).

'''Qualitative properties''' are properties that are observed and can generally not be measured with a numerical result &lt;ref&gt;https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/qualitative&lt;/ref&gt;. They are contrasted to [[Quantitative property|quantitative properties]] which have numerical characteristics.  

Some engineering and scientific properties are qualitative. A [[test method]] can result in qualitative data about something. This can be a categorical result or a [[binary classification]] (e.g., pass/fail, [[go/no go]], [[Conformity|conform]]/non-conform). It can sometimes be an engineering judgement.

The data that all share a qualitative property form a [[nominal category]]. A variable which codes for the presence or absence of such a property is called a binary [[categorical variable]], or equivalently a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]].

==In businesses==
Some important qualitative properties that concern businesses are:

[[Human factors]], '[[human work capital]]' is probably one of the most important issues that deals with qualitative properties. Some common aspects are work, [[motivation]], general participation, etc. Although all of these aspects are not measurable in terms of quantitative criteria, the general overview of them could be summarized as a [[quantitative property]].

[[Environmental issues]] are in some cases quantitatively measurable, but other properties are qualitative e.g.: environmentally friendly [[manufacturing]], responsibility for the entire life of a product (from the raw-material till scrap), attitudes towards safety, efficiency, and minimum waste production. 

[[Ethical issues]] are closely related to environmental and human issues, and may be covered in [[corporate governance]]. [[Child labour]] and [[illegal dumping]] of waste are examples of ethical issues.

The way a company deals with its [[Shareholder|stockholders]] (the 'acting' of a company) is probably the most obvious qualitative aspect of a business. Although measuring something in qualitative terms is difficult, most people can (and will) make a judgement about a [[behaviour]] on the basis of how they feel treated. This indicates that qualitative properties are closely related to [[emotional]] impressions.

      <text bytes="15915" xml:space="preserve">In [[graph theory]], a graph is said to be a '''pseudorandom graph''' if it obeys certain properties that [[random graphs]] obey [[with high probability]]. There is no concrete definition of graph pseudorandomness, but there are many reasonable characterizations of pseudorandomness one can consider.

Pseudorandom properties were first formally considered by Andrew Thomason in 1987.&lt;ref name=th&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomason |first1=Andrew |title=Pseudo-random graphs |journal=Annals of Discrete Math |date=1987 |volume=33 |pages=307–331 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304020808730639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ks&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krivelevich |first1=Michael |last2=Sudakov |first2=Benny |title=Pseudo-random Graphs |journal=More Sets, Graphs and Numbers |date=2006 |volume=15 |pages=199–262 |url=https://people.math.ethz.ch/~sudakovb/pseudo-random-survey.pdf|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-32439-3_10 |isbn=978-3-540-32377-8 |series=Bolyai Society Mathematical Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined a condition called "jumbledness": a graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be &lt;math&gt;(p,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;-''jumbled'' for real &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;p&lt;1\leq \alpha&lt;/math&gt; if 

:&lt;math&gt;\left|e(U)-p\binom{|U|}{2}\right|\leq \alpha|U|&lt;/math&gt;

for every subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the vertex set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e(U)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of edges among &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (equivalently, the number of edges in the subgraph [[induced subgraph|induced]] by the vertex set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;). It can be shown that the [[Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model|Erdős–Rényi]] random graph &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; is [[almost surely]] &lt;math&gt;(p,O(\sqrt{np}))&lt;/math&gt;-jumbled.{{r|ks|p=6}} However, graphs with less uniformly distributed edges, for example a graph on &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; vertices consisting of an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vertex [[complete graph]] and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; completely independent vertices, are not &lt;math&gt;(p,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;-jumbled for any small &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, making jumbledness a reasonable quantifier for "random-like" properties of a graph's edge distribution. 

===Connection to local conditions===

Thomason showed that the "jumbled" condition is implied by a simpler-to-check condition, only depending on the codegree of two vertices and not every subset of the vertex set of the graph. Letting &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of common neighbors of two vertices &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, Thomason showed that, given a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices with minimum degree &lt;math&gt;np&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)\leq np^2+\ell&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; \left( p,\sqrt{(p+\ell)n}\,\right) &lt;/math&gt;-jumbled.{{r|ks|p=7}} This result shows how to check the jumbledness condition algorithmically in [[polynomial time]] in the number of vertices, and can be used to show pseudorandomness of specific graphs.{{r|ks|p=7}}

==Chung–Graham–Wilson theorem==

In the spirit of the conditions considered by Thomason and their alternately global and local nature, several weaker conditions were considered by Chung, Graham, and Wilson in 1989:&lt;ref name=cgw&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chung |first1=F. R. K. |last2=Graham |first2=R. L. |last3=Wilson |first3=R. M. |title=Quasi-Random Graphs |journal=Combinatorica |date=1989 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=345–362 |url=http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/wp/quasirandom1.pdf|doi=10.1007/BF02125347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices with edge density &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and some &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; can satisfy each of these conditions if

* '''Discrepancy''': for any subsets &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; of the vertex set &lt;math&gt;V=V(G)&lt;/math&gt;, the number of edges between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon n^2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;p|X||Y|&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Discrepancy on individual sets''': for any subset &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, the number of edges among &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon n^2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;p\binom{|X|}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Subgraph counting''': for every graph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the number of labeled copies of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; among the subgraphs of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon n^{v(H)}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;p^{e(H)}n^{v(H)}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''4-cycle counting''': the number of labeled &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;-cycles among the subgraphs of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon n^4&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;p^4n^4&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Codegree''': letting &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of common neighbors of two vertices &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{u,v\in V}\big|\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)-p^2 n\big|\leq \varepsilon n^3.&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Eigenvalue bounding''': If &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of the [[adjacency matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;pn&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\max\left(\left|\lambda_2\right|,\left|\lambda_n\right|\right)\leq \varepsilon n&lt;/math&gt;.

These conditions may all be stated in terms of a sequence of graphs &lt;math&gt;\{G_n\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G_n&lt;/math&gt; is on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices with &lt;math&gt;(p+o(1))\binom{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt; edges. For example, the 4-cycle counting condition becomes that the number of copies of any graph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G_n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left(p^{e(H)}+o(1)\right)e^{v(H)}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and the discrepancy condition becomes that &lt;math&gt;\left|e(X,Y)-p|X||Y|\right|=o(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;, using [[little-o notation]].

A pivotal result about graph pseudorandomness is the Chung–Graham–Wilson theorem, which states that many of the above conditions are equivalent, up to polynomial changes in &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;{{r|cgw}}. It is considered particularly surprising{{r|ks|p=9}} that the weak condition of having the "correct" 4-cycle density implies the other seemingly much stronger pseudorandomness conditions. 

Some implications in the Chung–Graham–Wilson theorem are clear by the definitions of the conditions: the discrepancy on individual sets condition is simply the special case of the discrepancy condition for &lt;math&gt;Y=X&lt;/math&gt;, and 4-cycle counting is a special case of subgraph counting. In addition, the graph counting lemma, a straightforward generalization of the [[Graph_removal_lemma#Proof_of_the_graph_removal_lemma|triangle counting lemma]], implies that the discrepancy condition implies subgraph counting. 

The fact that 4-cycle counting implies the codegree condition can be proven by a technique similar to the second-moment method. Firstly, the sum of codegrees can be upper-bounded:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{u,v\in G} \operatorname{codeg}(u,v)=\sum_{x\in G} \deg(x)^2\ge n\left(\frac{2e(G)}{n}\right)^2=\left(p^2+o(1)\right)n^3.&lt;/math&gt;

Given 4-cycles, the sum of squares of codegrees is bounded:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{u,v} \operatorname{codeg}(u,v)^2=\text{Number of labeled copies of }C_4 + o(n^4)\le \left(p^4+o(1)\right)n^4.&lt;/math&gt; 

Therefore, the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] gives

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{u,v\in G}|\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)-p^2n|\le n\left(\sum_{u,v\in G} \left(\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)-p^2n\right)^2\right)^{1/2},&lt;/math&gt; 

which can be expanded out using our bounds on the first and second moments of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{codeg}&lt;/math&gt; to give the desired bound. A proof that the codegree condition implies the discrepancy condition can be done by a similar, albeit trickier, computation involving the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. 

The eigenvalue condition and the 4-cycle condition can be related by noting that the number of labeled 4-cycles in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is, up to &lt;math&gt;o(1)&lt;/math&gt; stemming from degenerate 4-cycles, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}\left(A_G^4\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_G&lt;/math&gt; is the adjacency matrix of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The two conditions can then be shown to be equivalent by invocation of the [[Min-max_theorem|Courant–Fischer theorem]].{{r|cgw}}

==Connections to graph regularity==

The concept of graphs that act like random graphs connects strongly to the concept of graph regularity used in the [[Szemer%C3%A9di regularity lemma]]. For &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, a pair of vertex sets &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; is called '''&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-regular''', if for all subsets &lt;math&gt;A\subset X,B\subset Y&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;|A|\geq\varepsilon|X|,|B|\geq\varepsilon|Y|&lt;/math&gt;, it holds that

:&lt;math&gt;\left| d(X,Y) - d(A,B) \right| \le \varepsilon,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''edge density'' between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;: the number of edges between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; divided by &lt;math&gt;|X||Y|&lt;/math&gt;. This condition implies a bipartite analogue of the discrepancy condition, and essentially states that the edges between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; behave in a "random-like" fashion. In addition, it was shown by [[Miklós Simonovits]] and [[Vera T. Sós]] in 1991 that a graph satisfies the above weak pseudorandomness conditions used in the Chung–Graham–Wilson theorem if and only if it possesses a Szemerédi partition where nearly all densities are close to the edge density of the whole graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simonovits |first1=Miklós |last2=Sós |first2=Vera |title=Szemerédi's partition and quasirandomness |journal=Random Structures and Algorithms |date=1991 |volume=2 |pages=1–10|doi=10.1002/rsa.3240020102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Sparse pseudorandomness==

===Chung–Graham–Wilson theorem analogues===

The Chung–Graham–Wilson theorem, specifically the implication of subgraph counting from discrepancy, does not follow for sequences of graphs with edge density approaching &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, or, for example, the common case of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-[[regular graph|regular]] graphs on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. The following sparse analogues of the discrepancy and eigenvalue bounding conditions are commonly considered:

* '''Sparse discrepancy''': for any subsets &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; of the vertex set &lt;math&gt;V=V(G)&lt;/math&gt;, the number of edges between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon dn&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{n}|X||Y|&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Sparse eigenvalue bounding''': If &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of the [[adjacency matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\max\left(\left|\lambda_2\right|,\left|\lambda_n\right|\right)\leq \varepsilon d&lt;/math&gt;.

It is generally true that this eigenvalue condition implies the corresponding discrepancy condition, but the reverse is not true: the disjoint union of a random large &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular graph and a &lt;math&gt;d+1&lt;/math&gt;-vertex complete graph has two eigenvalues of exactly &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; but is likely to satisfy the discrepancy property. However, as proven by David Conlon and Yufei Zhao in 2017, slight variants of the discrepancy and eigenvalue conditions for &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular [[Cayley graph|Cayley graphs]] are equivalent up to linear scaling in &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Conlon |first1=David |last2=Zhao |first2=Yufei |title=Quasirandom Cayley graphs |journal=Discrete Analysis |date=2017 |volume=6 |arxiv=1603.03025v4 |doi=10.19086/da.1294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One direction of this follows from the [[expander mixing lemma]], while the other requires the assumption that the graph is a Cayley graph and uses the [[Grothendieck inequality]].

===Consequences of eigenvalue bounding===

A &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices is called an ''&lt;math&gt;(n,d,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;-graph'' if, letting the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;d=\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\max\left(\left|\lambda_2\right|,\left|\lambda_n\right|\right)\leq \lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Ramanujan_graph#Extremality_of_Ramanujan_graphs|Alon-Boppana bound]] gives that &lt;math&gt;\max\left(\left|\lambda_2\right|,\left|\lambda_n\right|\right)\geq 2\sqrt{d-1}-o(1)&lt;/math&gt; (where the &lt;math&gt;o(1)&lt;/math&gt; term is as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;), and Joel Friedman proved that a random &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular graph on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices is &lt;math&gt;(n,d,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\lambda=2\sqrt{d-1}+o(1)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Joel|date=2003|title=Relative expanders or weakly relatively Ramanujan graphs|journal=Duke Math.

There are graphs with &lt;math&gt;\lambda\leq 2\sqrt{d-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which are termed [[Ramanujan graphs]]. They have been studied extensively and there are a number of open problems relating to their existence and commonness. 

Given an &lt;math&gt;(n,d,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; graph for small &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, many standard graph-theoretic quantities can be bounded to near what one would expect from a random graph. In particular, the size of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; has a direct effect on subset edge density discrepancies via the expander mixing lemma. Other examples are as follows, letting &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;(n,d,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; graph:

===Connections to the Green–Tao theorem===

Pseudorandom graphs factor prominently in the proof of the [[Green–Tao theorem]]. The theorem is proven by transferring [[Szemerédi's theorem]], the statement that a set of positive integers with positive [[natural density]] contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, to the sparse setting (as the primes have natural density &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; in the integers). The transference to sparse sets requires that the sets behave pseudorandomly, in the sense that corresponding graphs and hypergraphs have the correct subgraph densities for some fixed set of small (hyper)subgraphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv=1403.2957 | title=The Green–Tao theorem: an exposition | first1=David | last1=Conlon | author1link=David Conlon | first2=Jacob | last2=Fox | author2link=Jacob Fox | first3=Yufei | last3=Zhao | mr=3285854 | journal=EMS Surveys in Mathematical Sciences | year=2014 | doi=10.4171/EMSS/6 | volume=1 | issue=2 | pages=249–282 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is then shown that a suitable superset of the prime numbers, called pseudoprimes, in which the primes are dense obeys these pseudorandomness conditions, completing the proof.

      <text bytes="16388" xml:space="preserve">'''Sidorenko's conjecture''' is an important [[conjecture]] in the field of [[graph theory]], posed by [[Alexander Sidorenko(mathematician)|Alexander Sidorenko]] in 1986. Roughly speaking, the conjecture states that for any [[bipartite graph]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices with average degree &lt;math&gt;pn&lt;/math&gt;, there are at least &lt;math&gt;p^{|E(H)|} n^{|V(H)|}&lt;/math&gt; labeled copies of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, up to a small error term. Formally, it provides an intuitive inequality about [[graph homomorphism]] densities in [[graphon|graphons]]. The conjectured inequality can be interpreted as a statement that the density of copies of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in a graph is asymptotically minimized by a random graph, as one would expect a &lt;math&gt;p^{|E(H)|}&lt;/math&gt; fraction of possible subgraphs to be a copy of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; if each edge exists with probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statement==

Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a graph. Then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is said to have '''Sidorenko's property''' if, for all [[Graphon | graphons]] &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, the inequality
: &lt;math&gt;t(H,W)\geq t(K_2,W)^{|E(H)|}&lt;/math&gt;
is true, where &lt;math&gt;t(H,W)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[homomorphism density]] of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

Sidorenko's conjecture (1986) states that every bipartite graph has Sidorenko's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

If &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, this means that the probability of a uniform random mapping from &lt;math&gt;V(H)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;V(G)&lt;/math&gt; being a homomorphism is at least the product over each edge in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of the probability of that edge being mapped to an edge in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. This roughly means that a randomly chosen graph with fixed number of vertices and average degree has the minimum number of labeled copies of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. This is not a surprising conjecture because the right hand side of the inequality is the probability of the mapping being a homomorphism if each edge map is independent. So one should expect the two sides to be at least of the same order. The natural extension to graphons would follow from the fact that every graphon is the [[limit point]] of some sequence of graphs.

The requirement that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is bipartite to have Sidorenko's property is necessary — if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a bipartite graph, then &lt;math&gt;t(K_3,W)=0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is triangle-free. But &lt;math&gt;t(K_2,W)&lt;/math&gt; is twice the number of edges in &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, so Sidorenko's property does not hold for &lt;math&gt;K_3&lt;/math&gt;. A similar argument shows that no graph with an odd cycle has Sidorenko's property. Since a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles, this implies that the only possible graphs that can have Sidorenko's property are bipartite graphs.

===Equivalent formulation===

Sidorenko's property is equivalent to the following reformulation:
: For all graphs &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices and an average degree of &lt;math&gt;pn&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;t(H,G)\geq p^{|E(H)|}&lt;/math&gt;.

This is equivalent because the number of homomorphisms from &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is twice the number of edges in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and the inequality only needs to be checked when &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a graph as previously mentioned.

In this formulation, since the number of non-injective homomorphisms from &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is at most a constant times &lt;math&gt;n^{|V(H)|-1}&lt;/math&gt;, Sidorenko's property would imply that there are at least &lt;math&gt;(p^{|E(H)|}-o(1))n^{|V(H)|}&lt;/math&gt; labeled copies of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

As previously noted, to prove Sidorenko's property it suffices to demonstrate the inequality for all graphs &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Throughout this section, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a graph on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices with average degree &lt;math&gt;pn&lt;/math&gt;. The quantity &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hom}(H,G)&lt;/math&gt; refers to the number of homomorphisms from &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. This quantity is the same as &lt;math&gt;n^{|V(H)|}t(H,G)&lt;/math&gt;.

Elementary proofs of Sidorenko's property for some graphs follow from the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] or [[Hölder's inequality]]. Others can be done by using [[spectral graph theory]], especially noting the observation that the number of closed paths of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; from vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to vertex &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the component in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th row and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th column of the matrix &lt;math&gt;A^\ell&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adjacency matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

===Cauchy–Schwarz: The 4-cycle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;===

By fixing two vertices &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, each copy of &lt;math&gt;C_4&lt;/math&gt; that have &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; on opposite ends can be identified by choosing two (not necessarily distinct) common neighbors of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Letting &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; denote the ''codegree'' of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the number of common neighbors), this implies
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hom}(C_4,G)=\sum_{u,v\in V(G)}\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)^2\geq\frac{1}{n^2}\left(\sum_{u,v\in V(G)}\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. The sum has now become a count of all pairs of vertices and their common neighbors, which is the same as the count of all vertices and pairs of their neighbors. So
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hom}(C_4,G)\geq\frac{1}{n^2}\left(\sum_{x\in V(G)}\deg(x)^2\right)^2\geq\frac{1}{n^2}\left(\frac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{x\in V(G)} \deg(x) \right)^2\right)^2=\frac{1}{n^2}\left(\frac{1}{n}(n\cdot pn)^2\right)^2=p^4n^4&lt;/math&gt;
by Cauchy–Schwarz again. So
: &lt;math&gt;t(C_4,G)=\frac{\operatorname{hom}(C_4,G)}{n^4}\geq p^4&lt;/math&gt;
as desired.

===Spectral graph theory: The 2''k''-cycle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2''k''&lt;/sub&gt;===

Although the Cauchy–Schwarz approach for &lt;math&gt;C_4&lt;/math&gt; is elegant and elementary, it does not immediately generalize to all even cycles. However, one can apply spectral graph theory to prove that all even cycles have Sidorenko's property. Note that odd cycles are not accounted for in Sidorenko's conjecture because they are not bipartite.

Using the observation about closed paths, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hom}(C_{2k},G)&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the diagonal entries in &lt;math&gt;A^{2k}&lt;/math&gt;. This is equal to the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of &lt;math&gt;A^{2k}&lt;/math&gt;, which in turn is equal to the sum of the &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt;th powers of the [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\dots\geq\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[min-max theorem]] implies that
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\geq\frac{\mathbf{1}^\intercal A\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1}^\intercal\mathbf{1}}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{x\in V(G)}\deg(x)=pn,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; components, all of which are &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. But then
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hom}(C_{2k},G)=\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i^{2k}\geq\lambda_1^{2k}\geq p^{2k}n^{2k}&lt;/math&gt;
because the eigenvalues of a [[symmetric matrix|real symmetric matrix]] are real. So
: &lt;math&gt;t(C_{2k},G)=\frac{\operatorname{hom}(C_{2k},G)}{n^{2k}}\geq p^{2k}&lt;/math&gt;
as desired.

===Entropy: Paths of length 3===

J.L. Xiang Li and [[Balázs Szegedy]] (2011) introduced the idea of using [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]] to prove some cases of Sidorenko's conjecture. Szegedy (2015) later applied the ideas further to prove that an even wider class of bipartite graphs have Sidorenko's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | title = An information theoretic approach to Sidorenko's conjecture
 | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Szegedy's proof wound up being abstract and technical, [[Timothy Gowers|Tim Gowers]] and Jason Long reduced the argument to a simpler one for specific cases such as paths of length &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gowers |first1=Tim |title=Entropy and Sidorenko’s conjecture — after Szegedy |url=https://gowers.wordpress.com/2015/11/18/entropy-and-sidorenkos-conjecture-after-szegedy/ |website=Gowers's Weblog |accessdate=1 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the proof chooses a nice [[probability distribution]] of choosing the vertices in the path and applies [[Jensen's inequality]] (i.e. convexity) to deduce the inequality.

Here, the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-blow-up of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is formed by replacing each vertex in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; copies of itself, each connected with its original neighbors in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

** Li and Szegedy's paper also used entropy methods to prove the property for a class of graphs called "reflection trees."
** Kim, Lee, and Lee's paper extended this idea to a class of graphs with a tree-like substructure called "tree-arrangeable graphs."

However, there are graphs for which Sidorenko's conjecture is still open. An example is the "Möbius strip" graph &lt;math&gt;K_{5,5}\setminus C_{10}&lt;/math&gt;, formed by removing a &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;-cycle from the complete bipartite graph with parts of size &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;.

[[László Lovász]] proved a local version of Sidorenko's conjecture, i.e. for graphs that are "close" to random graphs in a sense of cut norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Forcing conjecture==

A sequence of graphs &lt;math&gt;\{G_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is called ''quasi-random with density &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;'' for some density &lt;math&gt;0&lt;p&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; if for every graph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;t(H,G_n)=(1+o(1))p^{|E(H)|}.&lt;/math&gt;
The sequence of graphs would thus have properties of the [[Erdős–Rényi model|Erdős–Rényi random graph]] &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt;.

If the edge density &lt;math&gt;t(K_2,G_n)&lt;/math&gt; is fixed at &lt;math&gt;(1+o(1))p&lt;/math&gt;, then the condition implies that the sequence of graphs is near the equality case in Sidorenko's property for every graph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

From Chung, Graham, and Wilson's 1989 paper about quasi-random graphs, it suffices for the &lt;math&gt;C_4&lt;/math&gt; count to match what would be expected of a random graph (i.e. the condition holds for &lt;math&gt;H=C_4&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The forcing conjecture states the following:
: A graph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is forcing if and only if it is bipartite and not a tree.
It is straightforward to see that if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is forcing, then it is bipartite and not a tree. Some examples of forcing graphs are even cycles (shown by Chung, Graham, and Wilson). Skokan and Thoma showed that all complete bipartite graphs that are not trees are forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Sidorenko's conjecture follows from the forcing conjecture. Furthermore, the forcing conjecture would show that graphs that are close to equality in Sidorenko's property must satisfy quasi-randomness conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In mathematics, specifically in [[control theory]], '''subspace identification (SID)''' aims at identifying [[linear time-invariant theory|linear time invariant]] (LTI) state space models from input-output data. SID does not require that the user parametrizes the system matrices before solving a parametric optimization problem and, as a consequence, SID methods do not suffer from problems related to local minima that often lead to unsatisfactory identification results.

== History ==

SID methods are rooted in the work by the German mathematician [[Leopold Kronecker]] (1823–1891). Kronecker&lt;ref&gt;L. Kronecker, "Algebraische reduktion der schaaren bilinearer formen", S. B. Akad. Berlin, pp. 663–776, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a power series can be written as a rational function when the rank of the Hankel operator that has the power series as its symbol is finite. The rank determines the order of the polynomials of the rational function.

In the 1960's the work of Kronecker inspired a number of researchers in the area of Systems and Control, like Ho and Kalman, Silverman and Youla and Tissi, to store the [[Markov parameter]]s of an LTI system into a finite dimensional [[Hankel matrix]] and derive from this matrix an (A,B,C) realization of the LTI system. The key observation was that when the Hankel matrix is properly dimensioned versus the order of the LTI system, the rank of the Hankel matrix is the order of the LTI system and the SVD of the Hankel matrix provides a basis of the column space observability matrix and row space of the controllability matrix of the LTI system. Knowledge of this key spaces allows to estimate the system matrices via linear least squares&lt;ref&gt;M. Verhaegen, "Subspace Techniques in System Identification", in Encyclopedia of Systems and Control, https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4471-5102-9_107-1&lt;/ref&gt;. 

An extension to the stochastic realization problem where we have knowledge only of the Auto-correlation (covariance) function of the output of an LTI system driven by white noise, was derived by researchers like Akaike&lt;ref&gt;H. Akaike, "A new look at the statistical model identification", IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, vol. 19, pp. 716–723, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A second generation of SID methods attempted to make SID methods directly operate on input-output measurements of the LTI system in the decade 1985–1995. One such generalization was presented under the name of the [[Eigensystem realization algorithm|Eigensystem Realization Algorithm]] (ERA) made use of specific input-output measurements considering the impulse inputs&lt;ref&gt;J.-N. Juang and R. S. Pappa, R. S., "An Eigensystem Realization Algorithm for modal parameter identification and model reduction", Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics. vol. 8, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been used for modal analysis of flexible structures, like bridges, space structures, etc. These methods have demonstrated to work in practice for resonant structures they did not work well for other type of systems and an input different from an impulse. A new impulse to the development of SID methods was made for operating directly on generic input-output data and avoiding to first explicitly compute the Markov parameters or estimating the samples of covariance functions prior to realizing the system matrices. Pioneers that contributed to these breakthroughs were Van Overschee and De Moor – introducing the N4SID approach&lt;ref&gt;P. Van Overschee and B. De Moor, "N4SID: Subspace algorithms for the identification of combined deterministic-stochastic systems", Automatica, vol. 30 pp. 75–93, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;, Verhaegen – introducing the MOESP approach&lt;ref&gt;M. Verhaegen, "Identification of the deterministic part of MIMO state space models given in innovations form from input-output data", Automatica, vol. 30, pp. 61–74, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and Larimore – presenting ST in the framework of Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA)&lt;ref&gt;W. Larimore, "Canonical variate analysis in identification, filtering, and adaptive control", in Proceedings of the 29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a CNN model, MgNet can be obtained by making some very minor modifications of a classic geometric multigrid method. Actually, connections between ResNet and classical multigrid methods were acknowledged in the original paper of ResNet&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; from the viewpoint how residuals are applied in both methods. MgNet&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; makes such a connection more direct and clear, and it makes it possible to directly obtain a class of efficient CNN models by simply making some very minor modification of a typical multigrid cycle but keeping the identically same algorithm structure.

== Main structure and connections with ResNet ==
One core concept in MgNet, motivated by our research in algebraic multigrid methods,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is the distinction between the so-called data and feature spaces (that are dual to each other). Based on this new concept, MgNet and a further research ({{cite arXiv|eprint=1911.10428v1|authors=Juncai He; Yuyan Chen; Jinchao Xu|title=Constrained Linear Data-feature Mapping for Image Classification|date=2019|class=eess.IV}}) proposes the constrained data-feature mapping model in every grid as

&lt;math&gt;A \ast u=f,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the data space and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the feature space such that

&lt;math&gt;u \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The feature extraction process can then be obtained through an iterative procedure for solving the above system in each grids. For example, if the single step residual correction scheme is applied for the above system, it becomes

&lt;math&gt;u^{i} = u^{i-1} + \sigma \circ B^{i} \ast \sigma(f^{} - A\ast u^{i-1}), \quad i = 1:\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;u \approx u^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the residual of the above iterative &lt;math&gt;r^i = f - A\ast u^i&lt;/math&gt;is further considered, it becomes

&lt;math&gt;r^{i} = r^{i-1} - A\ast \sigma \circ B^i\ast\sigma(r^{i-1}), \quad i=1:\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

This is almost the exact basic block scheme in Pre-act ResNet,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which has the form

&lt;math&gt;r^{i} = r^{i-1} - A^i \ast \sigma \circ B^i\ast\sigma(r^{i-1}), \quad i=1:\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

The next figure shows the pseudocode of MgNet:
[[File:MgNet_Framework.png|alt=|500x500px|center]]

One thing important to note is that the special MgNet Algorithm 1 is identical to a multigrid cycle&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; if the boxed nonlinear operations are removed in the algorithm.

== Summary ==
By revealing such a direct connection between CNN and multigrid method, this opens up a new door to the design and study of deep learning models from a more mathematical viewpoint and in particular the rich mathematical techniques developed for multigrid method can be applied in the study of [[deep learning]].

Very often the same concept is in more than one of these categories, expressed a different way and sometimes with a different name. Please also observe that a '''[[theorem]]''' is distinct from a [[:Category:Theories|theory]]. A [[:Category:Lemmas|lemma]] is conceptually the same as a theorem. However a theorem is called a lemma when its proof is only considered to be a step in the proof of some other, more important theorem.

      <text bytes="21537" xml:space="preserve">In mathematics, the '''Moy-Prasad filtration''' is a family of [[filtration (mathematics)|filtrations]] of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] [[reductive group]]s and their [[Lie algebra]]s, named after Allen Moy and [[Gopal Prasad]]. The family is parameterized by the [[building (mathematics)|Bruhat-Tits building]]; that is, each point of the building gives a different filtration. Alternatively, since the initial term in each filtration at a point of the building is the [[parahoric subgroup]] for that point, the Moy-Prasad filtration can be viewed as a filtration of a parahoric subgroup of a reductive group.

The chief application of the Moy-Prasad filtration is to the [[representation theory]] of ''p''-adic groups, where it can be used to define a certain real number called the '''depth''' of a representation. The representations of depth ''r'' can be better understood by studying the ''r''th Moy-Prasad subgroups. This information then leads to a better understanding of the overall structure of the representations, and that understanding in turn has applications to other areas of mathematics, such as [[number theory]] via the [[Langlands program]].

==History==
In their foundational work on the theory of buildings, Bruhat and Tits defined subgroups associated to concave functions of the root system.{{sfn | Bruhat | Tits | 1972 | loc=Section 6.4}} These subgroups are a special case of the Moy-Prasad subgroups, defined when the group is [[Reductive group#Definitions|split]]. The main innovations of Moy and Prasad{{sfn | Moy | Prasad | 1994}} were to generalize Bruhat-Tits's construction to [[quasi-split group]]s, in particular [[algebraic torus|tori]], and to use the subgroups to study the representation theory of the ambient group.

==Examples==
The following examples use the ''p''-adic rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt; and the ''p''-adic integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt;. A reader unfamiliar with these rings may instead replace &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Rational number|rational numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Integer|integers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; without losing the main idea.

=== Multiplicative group ===
The simplest example of a ''p''-adic reductive group is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p^\times&lt;/math&gt;, the [[multiplicative group]] of ''p''-adic [[Unit (ring theory)|units]]. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p^\times&lt;/math&gt; is [[Abelian group|abelian]], it has a unique parahoric subgroup,  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p^\times&lt;/math&gt;. The Moy-Prasad subgroups of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p^\times&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Higher unit group|higher unit groups]] &lt;math&gt;U^{(r)}&lt;/math&gt;, where for simplicity &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a positive integer: &lt;math display="block"&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_p^\times)_r=1+(p\,\mathbb{Z}_p)^r = \{u\in\mathbb{Z}_p^\times:u\equiv1\bmod{p^r}\}.&lt;/math&gt;The Lie algebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p^\times&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt;, and its Moy-Prasad subalgebras are the nonzero [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math display="block"&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_p)_r=(p\,\mathbb{Z}_p)^r = \{p^ra : a\in\mathbb{Z}_p\}.&lt;/math&gt;More generally, if &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a positive real number then we use the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]] to define the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;th Moy-Prasad subgroup and subalgebra: &lt;math display="block"&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_p^\times)_r := (\mathbb{Z}_p^\times)_{\lfloor r\rfloor},\qquad(\mathbb{Z}_p)_r := (\mathbb{Z}_p)_{\lfloor r\rfloor}&lt;/math&gt;This example illustrates the general phenomenon that although the Moy-Prasad filtration is indexed by the nonnegative real numbers, the filtration jumps only on a discrete, periodic subset, in this case, the natural numbers. In particular, it is usually the case that the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;th and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;th Moy-Prasad subgroups are equal if &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is only slightly larger than &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

=== General linear group ===
Another important example of a ''p''-adic reductive group is the [[general linear group]] &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)&lt;/math&gt;; this example generalizes the previous one because &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_1(\mathbb{Q}_p) = \mathbb{Q}_p^\times&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)&lt;/math&gt; is nonabelian (when &lt;math&gt;n\geq2&lt;/math&gt;), it has infinitely many parahoric subgroups. One particular parahoric subgroup is &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)&lt;/math&gt;. The Moy-Prasad subgroups of &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)&lt;/math&gt; are the subgroups of elements equal to the [[identity matrix]] &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; modulo high powers of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Specifically, when &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a positive integer we define&lt;math display="block"&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)_r=1+(p\,\text{M}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p))^r = \{u\in\text{M}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p):u\equiv1\bmod{p^r}\}.&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\text{M}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[matrix algebra|algebra of ''n × n'' matrices]] with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt;. The Lie algebra of &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\text{M}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)&lt;/math&gt;, and its Moy-Prasad subalgebras are the spaces of matrices equal to the [[zero matrix]] modulo high powers of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;; when &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a positive integer we define&lt;math display="block"&gt;\text{M}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)_r=(p\,\text{M}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p))^r = \{u\in\text{M}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p):u\equiv0\bmod{p^r}\}.&lt;/math&gt;Finally, as before, if &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a positive real number then we use the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]] to define the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;th Moy-Prasad subgroup and subalgebra:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)_r := \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)_{\lfloor r\rfloor},\qquad\text{M}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)_r := \text{M}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)_{\lfloor r\rfloor}&lt;/math&gt;In this example, the Moy-Prasad groups would more commonly be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)_r&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a point of the building of &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)&lt;/math&gt; whose corresponding parahoric subgroup is &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p).&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
Although the Moy-Prasad filtration is commonly used to study the representation theory of ''p''-adic groups, one can construct Moy-Prasad subgroups over any [[Henselian ring|Henselian]], [[Discrete valuation|discretely valued]] field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, not just over a nonarchimedean local field. In this and subsequent sections, we will therefore assume that the base field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is Henselian and discretely valued, and with ring of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt;. Nonetheless, the reader is welcome to assume for simplicity that &lt;math&gt;k=\mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k=\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a reductive &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-group, let &lt;math&gt;r\geq0&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be a point of the extended Bruhat-Tits building of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;th Moy-Prasad subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G(k)&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;th Moy-Prasad Lie subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r}
&lt;/math&gt;; it is a [[Free module|free]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt;-module spanning &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r}
&lt;/math&gt;, or in other words, a [[Lattice (module)|lattice]]. (In fact, the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r}
&lt;/math&gt; can also be defined when &lt;math&gt;r&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, though the group &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; cannot.)

Perhaps the most basic property of the Moy-Prasad filtration is that it is decreasing: if &lt;math&gt;r\leq s
&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r}\supseteq\mathfrak{g}_{x,s}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}\supseteq G(k)_{x,s}&lt;/math&gt;. It is standard to then define the subgroup and subalgebra&lt;math display="block"&gt;G(k)_{x,r+}:=\bigcup_{s&gt;r} G(k)_{x,s},
\qquad
\mathfrak{g}_{x,r+}:=\bigcup_{s&gt;r} \mathfrak{g}_{x,s}.&lt;/math&gt;This convention is just a notational shortcut because for any &lt;math&gt;r
&lt;/math&gt;, there is an &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r+}=\mathfrak{g}_{x,r+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r+}=G(k)_{x,r+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Moy-Prasad filtration satisfies the following additional properties.{{sfn | Hakim | Murnaghan | 2010 | loc=Section 2.5}}

*A '''jump''' in the Moy-Prasad filtration is defined as an index (that is, nonnegative real number) &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r+}\neq G(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt;. The set of jumps is [[Discrete space|discrete]] and [[Countable set|countably infinite]].
*If &lt;math&gt;r\leq s&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[normal subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,s}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Ideal (Lie algebra)|ideal]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,s}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a notational convention in the subject to write &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r:s}:=G(k)_{x,r}/G(k)_{x,s}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r:s}:=\mathfrak{g}_{x,r}/\mathfrak{g}_{x,s}&lt;/math&gt; for the associated quotients.
* The quotient &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,0:0+}&lt;/math&gt; is a reductive group over the [[residue field]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt;, namely, the maximal reductive quotient of the special fiber of the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt;-group underlying the parahoric &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,0}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a nonarchimedean local field (such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt;) then this quotient is a [[group of lie type|finite group of Lie type]].
*&lt;math&gt;[G(k)_{x,r},G(k)_{x,s}]\subseteq G(k)_{x,r+s}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{g}_{x,r},\mathfrak{g}_{x,s}]\subseteq\mathfrak{g}_{x,r+s}&lt;/math&gt;; here the first bracket is the [[commutator]] and the second is the Lie bracket.
* For any automorphism &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\theta(G(k)_{x,r})=G(k)_{\theta(x),r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{d}\theta(\mathfrak{g}_{x,r}) = \mathfrak{g}_{\theta(x),r}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\text{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.
* For any [[uniformizer]] &lt;math&gt;\varpi&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\varpi\mathfrak{g}_{x,r}=\mathfrak{g}_{x,r+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Under certain technical assumptions on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, an additional important property is satisfied. By the commutator subgroup property, the quotient &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r:s}&lt;/math&gt; is abelian if &lt;math&gt;r\leq s\leq 2r&lt;/math&gt;. In this case there is a canonical isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r:s}\cong G(k)_{x,r:s}&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''Moy-Prasad isomorphism'''. The technical assumption needed for the Moy-Prasad isomorphism to exist is that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be '''tame''', meaning that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; splits over a [[Tame ramification|tamely ramified]] extension of the base field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. If this assumption is violated then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r:s}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r:s}&lt;/math&gt; are not necessarily isomorphic.{{sfn | Yu | 2015 |p=|loc=section 5}}

==Depth of a representation==
The Moy-Prasad can be used to define an important numerical invariant of a [[smooth representation]] &lt;math&gt;(\pi,V)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G(k)&lt;/math&gt;, the depth of the representation: this is the smallest number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that for some point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the building of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, there is a nonzero vector of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; fixed by &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r+}&lt;/math&gt;.

In a sequel to the paper defining their filtration, Moy and Prasad proved a structure theorem for depth-zero supercuspidal representations.{{sfn | Moy | Prasad | 1996 | loc=Proposition 6.6}} Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be a point in a minimal facet of the building of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the parahoric subgroup &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,0}&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal parahoric subgroup. The quotient &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,0:0+}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite group of Lie type. Let &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; be the inflation to &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,0}&lt;/math&gt; of a representation of this quotient that is cuspidal in the sense of [[Deligne-Lusztig theory]]. The stabilizer &lt;math&gt;G(k)_x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G(k)&lt;/math&gt; contains the parahoric group &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,0}&lt;/math&gt; as a finite-index normal subgroup. Let &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; be an irreducible representation of &lt;math&gt;G(k)_x&lt;/math&gt; whose restriction to &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,0}&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; as a subrepresentation. Then the [[compact induction]] of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;G(k)&lt;/math&gt; is a depth-zero supercuspidal representation. Moreover, every depth-zero supercuspidal representation is isomorphic to one of this form.

The [[local Langlands correspondence]] is expected to preserve depth, where the depth of an L-parameter is defined using the [[upper numbering]] filtration on the Weil group.{{sfn | Chen | Kamgarpour | 2014 | loc=Section 1}}

==Construction==
Although we defined &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to lie in the extended building of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, it turns out that the Moy-Prasad subgroup &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the image of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the reduced building, so that nothing is lost by thinking of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as a point in the reduced building.

Our description of the construction follows Yu's article on smooth models.{{sfn|Yu|2015}}

===Tori===
Since algebraic tori are a particular class of reductive groups, the theory of the Moy-Prasad filtration applies to them as well. It turns out, however, that the construction of the Moy-Prasad subgroups for a general reductive group relies on the construction for tori, so we begin by discussing the case where &lt;math&gt;G=T&lt;/math&gt; is a torus. Since the reduced building of a torus is a point there is only one choice for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and so we will suppress &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from the notation and write &lt;math&gt;T(k)_r:=T(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt;.

First, consider the special case where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Weil restriction]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_\text{m}&lt;/math&gt; along a finite separable extension &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;T(k)=\ell^\times&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, we define &lt;math&gt;T(k)_r&lt;/math&gt; as the set of &lt;math&gt;a\in\ell^\times&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\text{val}_k(x-1)\geq r&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\text{val}_k:\ell\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the unique [[Valuation (algebra)#Extension of valuations|extension]] of the valuation of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

A torus is said to be '''induced''' if it is the direct product of finitely many tori of the form considered in the previous paragraph. The &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;th Moy-Prasad subgroup of an induced torus is defined as the product of the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;th Moy-Prasad subgroup of these factors.

Second, consider the case where &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary torus. Here the Moy-Prasad subgroup &lt;math&gt;T(k)_0&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the integral points of the [[Néron model|Néron lft-model]] of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Bosch|Lütkebohmert|Raynaud|1990|loc=Chapter 10}} This definition agrees with the previously given one when &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is an induced torus.

It turns out that every torus can be embedded in an induced torus. To define the Moy-Prasad subgroups of a general torus &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, then, we choose an embedding of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; in an induced torus &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and define &lt;math&gt;T(k)_r:=T(k)_0\cap S(k)_r&lt;/math&gt;. This construction is independent of the choice of induced torus and embedding.

===Reductive groups===
For simplicity, we will first outline the construction of the Moy-Prasad subgroup &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; in the case where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is [[Reductive group#Definitions|split]]. After, we will comment on the general definition.

Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a maximal split torus of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; whose apartment contains &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; be the [[root system]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; be the root subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. As an abstract group &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_\text{a}&lt;/math&gt;, though there is no canonical isomorphism. The point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; determines, for each root &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, an additive valuation &lt;math&gt;v_{\alpha,x}:U_\alpha(k)\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. We define &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha(k)_{x,r}:=\{u\in U_\alpha(k) : v_{\alpha,x}(u)\geq r\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, the Moy-Prasad subgroup &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G(k)&lt;/math&gt; generated by the subgroups &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and the subgroup &lt;math&gt;T(k)_r&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is not split, then the Moy-Prasad subgroup &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by unramified descent from the quasi-split case, a standard trick in Bruhat-Tits theory. More specifically, one first generalizes the definition of the Moy-Prasad subgroups given above, which applies when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is split, to the case where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is only quasi-split, using the [[relative root system]]. From here, the Moy-Prasad subgroup can be defined for an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by passing to the maximal unramified extension &lt;math&gt;k^\text{nr}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, a field over which every reductive group, and in particular &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, is quasi-split, and then taking the fixed points of this Moy-Prasad group under the Galois group of &lt;math&gt;k^\text{nr}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

===Group schemes===
The &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; carries much more structure than the group &lt;math&gt;G(k)&lt;/math&gt; of rational points: the former is an [[algebraic variety]] whereas the second is only an abstract group. For this reason, there are many technical advantages to working not only with the abstract group &lt;math&gt;G(k)&lt;/math&gt;, but also the variety &lt;math&gt;G(k)&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, although we described &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; as an abstract group, a certain subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G(k)&lt;/math&gt;, it is desirable for &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; to be the group of integral points of a [[group scheme]] &lt;math&gt;G_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; defined over the ring of integers, so that &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r}=G_{x,r}(\mathcal{O}_k)&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, it is possible to construct such a group scheme &lt;math&gt;G_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Lie algebras===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; be the Lie algebra of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. In a similar procedure as for reductive groups, namely, by defining Moy-Prasad filtrations on the Lie algebra of a torus and the Lie algebra of a root group, one can define the Moy-Prasad Lie algebras &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;; they are free &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt;-modules, that is, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt;-lattices in the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;r\geq0&lt;/math&gt;, it turns out that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt; is just the Lie algebra of the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt;-group scheme &lt;math&gt;G_{x,r}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Indexing set===
We have defined the Moy-Prasad filtration at the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be indexed by the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers. It is common in the subject to extend the indexing set slightly, to the set &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and formal symbols &lt;math&gt;r+&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;r\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The element &lt;math&gt;r+&lt;/math&gt; is though of as being infinitesimally larger than &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, and the filtration is extended to this case by defining &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r+}:=\bigcup_{s&gt;r}G(k)_{x,s}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the valuation on &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is discrete, there is &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;G(k)_{x,r+}=G(k)_{x,r+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[brahmin]] '''Sissa''' ibn Dahir (also called Sessa or Sassa) is a [[mythical]] character from [[India]], known for the invention of [[Chaturanga]], the Indian predecessor of [[chess]], and the [[Wheat and chessboard problem|Wheat and Chessboard Problem]] he would have presented to the king when he was asked what reward he'd like for that invention.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=-8dLAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=Biographical%20dictionary%20of%20Ibn%20Khallikan%2C%20vol.%20III&amp;pg=PP9#v=onepage&amp;q=Sissa&amp;f=false Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary Vol.3 (1814)]'' , p.71 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

== A legend of the invention of chess ==

=== Synopsis ===
Sissa invents chess for an Indian king for educational purposes. In gratitude, the King asks Sissa how he wants to be rewarded. Sissa wishes to receive an amount of grain which is the sum of one grain on the first square of the chess board, and which is then doubled on every following square.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=L79FAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;ots=5M3JQ0BXOg&amp;dq=sissa%20chess%20married%20with%20daughter&amp;pg=PA400#v=onepage&amp;q=sissa%20&amp;f=false ''The Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure'' (1797),], "Origin of the Game of Chess", pp400-1&lt;/ref&gt;

This request is now known as the [[Wheat and chessboard problem|Wheat and Chessboard Problem]], and forms the basis of various mathematical and philosophical questions.

=== Historical origin ===
Until the nineteenth century, the legend of Sissa was one of several theories about the [[History of chess|origin of chess]]. Today it is mainly regarded as a myth because there is no clear picture of the origin of [[chaturanga]] (an ancient Indian chess game), and from which modern chess has developed.

The context of the mythical Sissa is described in detail in ''A History of Chess''. There are many variations and inconsistencies, and therefore little can be confirmed historically. Nevertheless, the legend of Sissa is placed by most sources in a Hindu kingdom between 400 and 600 AD, in an era after the invasion of [[Alexander the Great]]. The myth is often told from a Persian and Islamic perspective.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[[A History of Chess|Murray, H.J.R. (1913), ''A history of chess'', Oxford.]]





&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the oldest known narrative believed to have been the basis for the legend of Sissa is from before the [[Islam]]. It tells of Husiya, daughter of Balhait, a queen whose son is killed by a rebel, but of whom she does not initially hear the news. This news is subtly announced to her through the chess game that Sissa introduced to her.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Gordon ''et al'' (ed., 2018) ''[[iarchive:TarikhAlYaqubi/page/n3/mode/2up|The Works of Ibn Wadih Al-Yaqubi]]'', Brill, pp.354-357&lt;/ref&gt;

"History" is an [[umbrella term]] that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who focus on history are called [[historian]]s. The historian's role is to place the past in context, using sources from moments and events, and filling in the gaps to the best of their ability.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arnold|first=John H.|title=History: A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=019285352X|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written documents are not the only sources historians use to develop their understanding of the past. They also use material objects, oral accounts, ecological markers, art, and artifacts as [[historical source]]s.

History also includes the [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] which uses [[narrative]] to describe, examine, question, and analyze a sequence of past events, investigate the patterns of cause and effect that are related to them.&lt;ref name="evans1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Whatishistory/evans10.html|title= The Two Faces of E.H.

They often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects.

However, ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. History is often taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a [[Outline of academic disciplines#History|major discipline]] in university studies.

[[Herodotus]], a 5th-century BC [[Greek historiography|Greek historian]] is often considered (within the Western tradition) to be the "father of history," or, by some, the "father of lies." Along with his contemporary [[Thucydides]], he helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state [[chronicle]], the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]], was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
The word ''history'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ἱστορία|ἱστορία]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|ἱστορία}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''historía''), meaning 'inquiry', 'knowledge from inquiry', or 'judge'. It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his ''[[History of Animals]].''&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora"&gt;Ferrater-Mora, José. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancestor word {{lang|grc|ἵστωρ}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebes]]' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either 'judge' or 'witness', or similar). The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as ''historia'', meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative". ''History'' was borrowed from Latin (possibly via [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Welsh]]) into [[Old English]] as ''stær'' ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"&gt;"history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, as Latin became [[Old French]] (and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), ''historia'' developed into forms such as ''istorie'', ''estoire'', and ''historie'', with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)".&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

It was from Anglo-Norman that ''history'' was borrowed into [[Middle English]], and this time the loan stuck. It appears in the 13th-century ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'', but seems to have become a common word in the late 14th century, with an early attestation appearing in [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' of the 1390s (VI.1383): "I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire". In [[Middle English]], the meaning of ''history'' was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs" arose in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt; With the [[Renaissance]], older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late 16th century, when he wrote about "[[Natural History]]". For him, ''historia'' was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both 'history' and 'story'. ''Historian'' in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], the substantive ''history'' is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora" /&gt; The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;Whitney, W.D. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a "true discourse of past" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;W.D. Whitney, (1889). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 p. 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=17 September 2005 }}, "History".&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past"). Part of the historian's role is to skillfully and objectively utilize the vast amount of sources from the past, most often found in the archives. The process of creating a narrative inevitably generates a silence as historians remember or emphasize different events of the past.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. p. 1. {{ISBN|0-415-05682-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995). The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. p. 201. {{ISBN|0-415-12346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant intersections are often present. It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{Further|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p. 108, {{ISBN|0-14-020652-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
[[File:Guicciardini M Francesco La Historia dItalia.jpg|thumb|left|The title page to ''La Historia d'Italia'']]
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, [[world view]], use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Historiography: Ancient, medieval, and modern'' (University of Chicago Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the twentieth century: From scientific objectivity to the postmodern challenge'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[author]]ship)?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[historical criticism]]; the fifth, [[textual criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC – ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C.C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=5|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history". However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 BC – c. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at [[Causality|cause and effect]], rather than as the result of divine intervention (though Herodotus was not wholly committed to this idea himself).&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a nominally neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C.C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145–90 BC), author of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji''). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[Secularity|secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N.J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systemic bias|systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999). ''A Dictionary of Muslim Names''. C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers. {{ISBN|1-85065-356-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Enan&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|page=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "father of the philosophy of history".&lt;ref name=Akhtar&gt;Dr. S.W. Akhtar (1997). "The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought &amp; Culture'' '''12''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. In 1851, [[Herbert Spencer]] summarized these methods: 
{{quote|
From the successive strata of our historical deposits, they [Historians] diligently gather all the highly colored fragments, pounce upon everything that is curious and sparkling and chuckle like children over their glittering acquisitions; meanwhile the rich veins of wisdom that ramify amidst this worthless debris, lie utterly neglected. Cumbrous volumes of rubbish are greedily accumulated, while those masses of rich ore, that should have been dug out, and from which golden truths might have been smelted, are left untaught and unsought&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Robert Carneiro]], ''The Muse of History and the Science of Culture'', New York: Kluwer Publishers, 2000, p 160.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
By the "rich ore" Spencer meant scientific theory of history. Meanwhile, [[Henry Thomas Buckle]] expressed a dream of history becoming one day science: 
{{quote|
In regard to nature, events apparently the most irregular and capricious have been explained and have been shown to be in accordance with certain fixed and universal laws. This have been done because men of ability and, above all, men of patient, untiring thought have studied events with the view of discovering their regularity, and if human events were subject to a similar treatment, we have every right to expect similar results&lt;ref&gt;Cited in ''Muse of History'', p 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Contrary to Buckle's dream, the 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods became [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany. He limited history to “what really happened” and by this directed the field further away from science. For Ranke, historical data should be collected carefully, examined objectively and put together with critical rigor. But these procedures “are merely the prerequisites and preliminaries of science. The heart of science is searching out order and regularity in the data being examined and in formulating generalizations or laws about them.”&lt;ref&gt;''Muse of History'', p 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
As Historians like Ranke and many who followed him have pursued it, ''no'', history is not a science. Thus if Historians tell us that, given the manner in which he practices his craft, it cannot be considered a science, we must take him at his word. If he is not doing science, then, whatever else he is doing, he is not ''doing'' science. The traditional Historian is thus no scientist and history, as conventionally practiced, is not a science.&lt;ref&gt;''Muse of History'', p 150.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[Great Man theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. Nevertheless, these multidisciplinary approaches failed to produce a theory of history. So far only one theory of history came from the pen of a professional Historian.&lt;ref&gt;Max Ostrovski, ''The Hyperbole of the World Order'', Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever other theories of history we have, they were written by experts from other fields (for example, Marxian theory of history). More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In sincere opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[History of mentalities|histoire des mentalités]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[François Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]] defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

Today, most historians begin their research process in the archives, on either a physical or digital platform. They often propose an argument and use their research to support it. [[John H. Arnold (historian)|John H. Arnold]] proposed that history is an argument, which creates the possibility of creating change.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Digital information companies, such as [[Google]], have sparked controversy over the role of internet censorship in information access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=King|first=Michelle T.|title=Research Methods for History|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2016|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=Edinburgh|pages=|chapter=Working With/In the Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxian theory===
{{Main|Marx's theory of history}}
The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist historiography]] was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail M. Krom, "From the Center to the Margin: the Fate of Marxism in Contemporary Russian Historiography," ''Storia della Storiografia'' (2012) Issue 62, pp. 121–130&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential Shortcomings in the Production of History ===
Many historians believe that the production of history is embedded with [[bias]] because events and known facts in history can be interpreted in a variety of ways. [[Constantin Fasolt]] suggested that history is linked to politics by the practice of silence itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fasolt|first=Constantin|title=The Limits of History|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2004|isbn=0226239101|location=Chicago|pages=xiii-xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; “A second common view of the link between history and politics rests on the elementary observation that historians are often influenced by politics.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to [[Michel-Rolph Trouillot]], the historical process is rooted in the archives, therefore silences, or parts of history that are forgotten, may be an intentional part of a narrative strategy that dictates how areas of history are remembered.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Trouillot|first=Michel-Rolph|title=Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=31–69|chapter=The Three Faces of Sans Souci: The Glories and the Silences in the Haitian Revolution|asin=B00N6PB6DG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical omissions can occur in many ways and can have a profound effect on historical records. Information can also purposely be excluded or left out accidentally. Historians have coined multiple terms that describe the act of omitting historical information, including: “silencing,”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; “selective memory,”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lerner|first=Gerda|title=Why History Matters: Life and Thought|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=0195046447|location=New York|pages=199–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; and erasures.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cronon|first=William|date=1992|title=A Place for Stories: Nature, History, and Narrative|url=|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=78|pages=1347–1376|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerda Lerner]], a twentieth century historian who focused much of her work on historical omissions involving women and their accomplishments, explained the negative impact that these omissions had on minority groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Environmental historian [[William Cronon]] proposed three ways to combat bias and ensure authentic and accurate narratives: narratives must not contradict known fact, they must make ecological sense (specifically for environmental history), and published work must be reviewed by scholarly community and other historians to ensure accountability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.&lt;ref name="Marwick-p169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillan Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period. [[Century|Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reFflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name="Tosh-p168-169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prehistoric periodisation====
The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] past, in [[archaeology]] is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Here prehistory is divided into a series of "chapters" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Time|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-31197-7|location=Oxon|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation. There are periodisation, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology and, thus, devoid of any specific meaning.

Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through [[radiocarbon dating]] and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. Periodisation, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that "cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodisation boundaries" and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Living Landscape: Bronze Age Settlement Sites in the Dutch River Area (c. 2000–800 BC)|last=Arnoldussen|first=Stijn|publisher=Sidestone Press|year=2007|isbn=978-90-8890-010-5|location=Leiden|pages=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[Geography|geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[Country|countries]], and [[City|cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. According to [[Jules Michelet]] in his book ''Histoire de France'' (1833), "without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Relations of History and Geography: Studies in England, France and the United States|last=Darby|first=Henry Clifford|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=2002|isbn=0-85989-699-4|location=Exeter|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. There is also the case of climate, which historians like [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and Allen Semple, cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history from early times to AD 2000|last=Rao|first=B.V.|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

====Regions====
* [[History of Africa]] begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.
* [[History of the Americas]] is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.
** [[History of North America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's northern and western hemisphere.

** [[History of the Caribbean]] begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have been found.
** [[History of South America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's southern and western hemisphere.
* [[History of Antarctica]] emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe.
* [[History of Australia]] starts with the documentation of the Makassar trading with Indigenous Australians on Australia's north coast.
* [[History of New Zealand]] dates back at least 700 years to when it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori culture centred on kinship links and land.
* [[History of the Pacific Islands]] covers the history of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.
* [[History of Eurasia]] is the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe, linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
** [[History of Europe]] describes the passage of time from humans inhabiting the European continent to the present day.
** [[History of Asia]] can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.
*** [[History of East Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in East Asia.
*** [[History of the Middle East]] begins with the earliest civilizations in the region now known as the Middle East that were established around 3000 BC, in Mesopotamia (Iraq).
*** [[History of India]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in the Sub-Himalayan region.
*** [[History of Southeast Asia]] has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
{{Main|History of religions}}

The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]'', and ''[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Cochrane |title=What Is Catholic Historiography? |journal=Catholic Historical Review |volume=61 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=169–190 |jstor=25019673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.&lt;ref&gt;For example see {{cite journal |first=Sofia Boesch |last=Gajano |first2=Tommaso |last2=Caliò |title=Italian Religious Historiography in the 1990s |journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=293–306 |jstor= |doi=10.1080/13545719808454982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history'', is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. {{cite journal|at=p. 42|jstor=2539326|title=Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations|journal=International Security|volume=22|issue=1|last1=Haber|first1=Stephen H.|last2=Kennedy|first2=David M.|last3=Krasner|first3=Stephen D.|year=1997|doi=10.1162/isec.22.1.34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with social history while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 – listed by research interest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530073940/http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html |date=30 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great Man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M.

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of [[History of art|art in society]] as well is the study of images and human visual production ([[iconography]]).&lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}. (with 275 specialists from all continents, all specialities, all periods from Prehistory to nowadays) ; Laurent Gervereau, "Images, une histoire mondiale", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2008, 272p., {{ISBN|978-2-84736-362-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]]  focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."&lt;ref&gt;Muriel E Chamberlain, ''Pax Britannica'? British Foreign Policy 1789–1914'' (1988) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history|Business history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?," Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp. 17–20, with responses pp. 20–27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business history]]  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Amatori, and Geoffrey Jones, eds. ''Business History Around the World'' (2003) [https://www.questia.com/read/114846992 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an offshoot of the environmental movement, which was kickstarted by Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring'' in the 1960s.

===World history===
{{main|World history}}
{{See also|History of the world|Universal history}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ainslie Embree]] and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, "World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,"''Chinese Studies in History'', Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp. 84–96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |title=Journal of World History |accessdate=7 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501050602/http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |archivedate=1 May 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~world/|title=H-World |website=www.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]]s, and the otherwise forgotten people. The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement in Britain in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade Matthews|title=The New Left, National Identity, and the Break-up of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lfmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|year=2013|publisher=Brill|pages=20–21|isbn=978-90-04-25307-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual history===
{{Main|Intellectual history|History of ideas}}
Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Grafton |title=The History of Ideas: Precept and Practice, 1950–2000 and beyond |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=67 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=1–32 |url=http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf |doi=10.1353/jhi.2006.0006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Maryanne Cline |editor-last=Horowitz |title=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a subfield of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. The outgrowth of gender history from [[Women's history|women's history]] stemmed from many non-[[Feminism|feminist]] historians dismissing the importance of women in history. According to Joan W. Scott, “Gender is a constitutive element of social relationships based on perceived differences between the sexes, and gender is a primary way of signifying relations of power,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wallach Scott|first=Joan|title=Gender and the Politics of History|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1988|isbn=0231188013|location=New York|pages=28–50|chapter=Gender: A Useful Category of Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that gender historians study the social effects of perceived differences between the sexes and how all genders utilize allotted power in societal and political structures. Despite being a relatively new field, gender history has had a significant effect on the general study of history. Gender history traditionally differs from women's history in its inclusion of all aspects of gender such as masculinity and femininity, and today's gender history extends to include people who identify outside of that binary.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 3377910|title = Public History and the Study of Memory|journal = The Public Historian|volume = 18|issue = 2|pages = 7–23|last1 = Glassberg|first1 = David|year = 1996|doi = 10.2307/3377910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LGBTQ+ History ===
{{Main|LGBT history}}
[[LGBT history]] deals with the first recorded instances of same-sex love and sexuality of [[Ancient history|ancient civilizations]], involves the history of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) peoples and cultures around the world. A common feature of LGBTQ+ history is the focus on oral history and individual perspectives, in addition to traditional documents within the archives.

==Historians==
{{Main list|List of historians}}
[[File:B.Croce.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benedetto Croce]]]]
[[File:Ban Zhao.jpg|alt=Ban Zhao, courtesy name Huiban, was the first known female Chinese historian. |thumb|upright=0.45|[[Ban Zhao]], courtesy name Huiban, was the first known female Chinese historian. ]]
Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. They discover this information through archaeological evidence, written primary sources, verbal stories or oral histories, and other archival material. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. [[Chronicle]]rs and [[annals|annalists]], though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

==Judgement==
{{see also|Ash heap of history}}
Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history."&lt;ref name="Curran2000p413"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F.C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413 pp. 413–415]&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of [[Judgment (law)|legal judgements]], that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.&lt;ref name="Curran2000p415"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F.C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415 p. 415]&lt;/ref&gt; A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of [[collective memory]].

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

[[Pseudohistory]] is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
It is closely related to deceptive [[Historical negationism|historical revisionism]]. Works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching==

===Scholarship vs teaching===
A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor [[Charles Harding Firth]], Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] was professionalizing the History undergraduate programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Roots, "Firth, Sir Charles Harding (1857–1936)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33137, Online; accessed 10 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reba Soffer, "Nation, duty, character and confidence: history at Oxford, 1850–1914." ''Historical Journal'' (1987) 30#01 pp. 77–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Donoghue, ''The Last Professors: The Corporate University and the Fate of the Humanities'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, "Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York," ''History Teacher'', (November 2009), 43#1 pp. 87–96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the ''[[Nouvelle histoire]]'' as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, " The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s," ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199–221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias in school teaching===
[[File:Historybooks.JPG|thumb|History books in a bookstore]]
In several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official narrative about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, "The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', May 2008, Vol. 617, pp. 107–122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;"Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History," ''Russian Studies in History'', Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |journal=International Affairs |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=365–370 |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x|year = 2008|last1 = Wedgwood Benn|first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], textbooks published by the same company often differ in content from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=American history textbooks can differ across the country, in ways that are shaded by partisan politics.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/12/us/texas-vs-california-history-textbooks.html|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of content that is represented different in different regions of the country is the history of the [[Southern United States|Southern states]], where [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[American Civil War]] are treated as controversial topics. [[McGraw-Hill Education]] for example, was criticised for describing Africans brought to American plantations as "workers" instead of slaves in a textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Hauser|first2=Christine|date=5 October 2015|title=Texas Mother Teaches Textbook Company a Lesson on Accuracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India," ''History Workshop Journal'', April 2009, Issue 67, pp. 99–110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, "Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR," ''History Teacher'', February 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp. 179–188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace."  The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Lässig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, "History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany," ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp. 128–129 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="43138" xml:space="preserve">A '''historical figure''' is a famous person in [[history]], such as [[Catherine the Great]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Washington]], or [[Napoleon]].

The significance of such figures in human progress has been debated. Some think they play a crucial role, while others say they have little impact on the broad currents of thought and social change.  The concept is generally used in the sense that the person really existed in the past, as opposed to being legendary. However, the legends that can grow up around historical figures may be hard to distinguish from fact.  Sources are often incomplete and may be inaccurate, particularly those from early periods of history. Without a body of personal documents, the more subtle aspects of personality of a historical figure can only be deduced. With historical figures who were also religious figures attempts to separate fact from belief may be controversial.

In education, presenting information as if it were being told by a historical figure may give it greater impact. Since classical times, students have been asked to put themselves in the place of a historical figure as a way of bringing history to life. Historical figures are often represented in fiction, where fact and fancy are combined. In earlier traditions, before the rise of a critical historical tradition, authors took less care to be as accurate when describing what they knew of historical figures and their actions, interpolating imaginary elements intended to serve a moral purpose to events: such is [[Notker the Stammerer|the Monk of St. Gall]]'s anecdotal account of [[Charlemagne]], ''De Carolo Magno''. More recently there has been a tendency once again for authors to freely depart from the "facts" when they conflict with their creative goals.

==Significance==
The significance of historical figures has long been the subject of debate by philosophers. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) considered that "world-historical figures" played a pivotal role in human progress, but felt that they were bound to emerge when change was needed. [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1795–1881) saw the study of figures such as [[Muhammad]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]] as key to understanding history. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903), an early believer in evolution and in the universality of natural law, felt that historical individuals were of little importance.

===Hegel's world-historical figure===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] introduced the concept of the "world-historical figure".]]
The German philosopher Hegel defined the concept of the world-historical figure, who embodied the ruthless advance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s World Spirit, often overthrowing outdated structures and ideas.  To him, [[Napoleon]] was such a figure.{{sfn|Hagen|2012|p=125}}
Hegel proposed that a world-historical figure essentially posed a challenge, or thesis, and this would generate an antithesis, or opposing force. Eventually a synthesis would resolve the conflict.{{sfn|Van Doren|2008|p=277}}
Hegel viewed [[Julius Caesar]] as a world historical figure, who appeared at a stage when Rome had grown to the point it could no longer continue as a republican city state but had to become an empire.  Caesar failed in his bid to make himself an emperor, and was assassinated, but the empire came into existence soon afterward, and Caesar's name has become synonymous with "emperor" in forms such as "[[kaiser]]" or "[[czar]]".{{sfn|Karatani|2011|p=20}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]], in his early essay ''The Concept of Irony'', generally agrees with Hegel's views, such as his characterization of [[Socrates]] as a world-historical figure who acted as a destructive force on Greek received views of morality.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=179}}
In Hegel's view, Socrates broke down social harmony by questioning the meaning of concepts like "justice" and "virtue".
Eventually, the Athenians quite rightly *(Name source) condemned Socrates to death. But they could not stop the evolution of thought that Socrates had begun, which would lead to the concept of individual conscience.{{sfn|Magee|2001|p=192}}
Hegel said of world-historical figures,
{{blockquote|It was theirs to know this nascent principle; the necessary, directly sequent step in progress, which their world was to take; to make this their aim, and to expend their energy in promoting it ... They die early like Alexander; they are murdered, like Caesar; transported to St. Helena, like Napoleon ... They are ''great'' men, because they willed and accomplished something great; not a mere fancy, a mere intention, but that which met the case and fell in with the needs of the age.{{sfn|Cramer|2007|p=272}}}}

However, Hegel, [[Thomas Carlyle]] and others noted that the great historical figures were just representative men, expressions of the material forces of history.  Essentially they have little choice about what they do. This is in conflict with the views of [[George Bancroft]] or [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who praised self-reliance and individualism, and in conflict with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who also felt that individuals can determine their destiny.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=5}}
Engels found that Hegel's system contained an "internal and incurable contradiction", resting as it does on both [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical relativism]] and idealistic absolutism.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=xv}}

===Spencerian view===
[[File:Spencer1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]], who considered events in the lives of kings "historic trivalities"]]
The Scottish philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], who was highly influential in the latter half of the nineteenth century, felt that historical figures were relatively unimportant.
He wrote to a friend, "I ignore utterly the personal element in history, and, indeed, show little respect for history altogether as it is ordinarily conceived."
He wrote, "The births, deaths,  and marriages of kings, and other like historic trivialities, are committed to memory, not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them:  but because society considers them parts of a good education."{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188}}
In his essay ''What Knowledge Is of Most Worth?'' he wrote:
{{blockquote|That which constitutes History,  properly so called, is in great part omitted from works on the subject. Only of late years have historians commenced giving us, in any considerable quantity, the truly valuable information. As in past ages the king was everything and the people nothing; So, in past histories, the doings of the king fill the entire picture, to which the national life forms but an obscure background. While only now, when the welfare of nations rather than of rulers is becoming the dominant idea, are historians beginning to occupy themselves with the phenomena of social progress. The thing it really concerns us to know is the natural history of society.{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188-189}}}}

===Inevitability or determinism===
Taken to an extreme, one may consider that what Hegel calls the "world spirit" and [[T. S. Eliot]] calls "those vast impersonal forces" hold us in their grip.  What happens is predetermined.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}} 
Both Hegel and Marx advocated historical inevitability in contrast to the doctrine of contingency, allowing for alternative outcomes, that was advocated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]] and others.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2011|p=chapter 9}}
However, Marx argued against the use of the  "historical inevitability" argument when used to explain the destruction of early communes in Russia.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2009|p=158}}
As an orthodox Marxist, [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the laws of history that Marx had discovered, including the historical inevitability of capitalism followed by a transition to socialism.
Despite this, Lenin also believed the transition could be effected faster by voluntary action.{{sfn|Chen|2007|p=37}}

In 1936 [[Karl Popper]] published an influential paper on ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', published as a book in 1957, that attacked the doctrine of historical inevitability.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=218}}
The historian [[Isaiah Berlin]], author of ''Historical Inevitability'', also argued forcibly against this view, going as far as to say that some choices are entirely free and cannot be predicted scientifically.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}}
Berlin presented his views in a 1953 lecture at the [[London School of Economics]], published soon afterwards.  When speaking he referred to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s views, but the published version speaks approvingly of Karl Popper, which caused a stir among academics.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=152}}

===Heroic view===
[[File:Carlyle by Elliott &amp; Fry c1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Carlyle]], champion of study of great men]]
[[Thomas Carlyle]] has espoused the "heroic view" of history, famously saying in his essay on the Norse god [[Odin]] in his book ''On heroes, hero-worship, &amp; the heroic in history'' that "No great man lives in vain. The History of the world is but the Biography of great men ... We do not now call our great men Gods, nor admire ''without'' limit; ah no, ''with'' limit enough! But if we have no great men, or do not admire at all,— that were a still worse case."{{sfn|Carlyle|1841|p=47}}
Carlyle's historical philosophy was based on the "[[Great Man theory]]", saying, "Universal History, the history of what man has accomplished in the world ... [is] at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here."
An extreme believer in individuality, he also believed that the masses of people should let themselves be guided by the great leaders of men.{{sfn|Carlyle|2007|p=9}}
Talking of poets he said,
{{blockquote|That ideal outline of himself, which a man unconsciously shadows forth in his writings, and which, if rightly deciphered, will be truer than any other representation of him, it is the task of the Biographer to fill-up into an actual coherent figure, and to bring him to our experience, or at least our clear undoubted admiration, thereby to instruct and edify us in many ways. Conducted on such principles, the Biography of great men, especially of great Poets, that is, of men in the highest degree noble-minded and wise, might become one of the most dignified and valuable species of composition.{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=138}}}}
More recently, in his 1943 book ''The Hero in History'', the [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] scholar [[Sidney Hook]] asserts:
{{blockquote|That history is made by men and women is no longer denied except by some theologians and mystical metaphysicians.  And even they are compelled indirectly to acknowledge this commonplace truth, for they speak of historical personages as 'instruments' of Providence, Justice, Reason, Dialectic, the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', or Spirit of the Times.  Men agree more readily about the consequences of the use of 'instruments' in history than they do about the ultimate ends 'instruments' allegedly serve, or the first causes by which they are allegedly determined.{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xi}}}}
Hook recognizes the relevance of the environment within which the "great man" or "hero" acted, but asserts that this can provide the backdrop but never the plot of the "dramas of human history". and distinguish life and species{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xiii}}

===Ranking===
[[File:Crucifixion by Jacob Jordaens.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The crucifixion of Jesus, the founder of [[Christianity]], painted by [[Jacob Jordaens]] in the 17th century.]]
There have been rankings of the significance of major historical figures.  For example, [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] and colleagues at the [[MIT Media Lab]] has calculated the memorability of historical figures using data such as the number of language editions for which there are articles for each person, the pageviews received, and other factors.  These lists are available at MIT's [https://web.archive.org/web/20190330043133/http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/ Pantheon ] project.

==Historical truth==
It is sometimes hard to discern whether apparently historical figures from the earliest periods did in fact exist, due to the lack of records.  Even with more recent personages, stories or anecdotes about the person often accumulate that have no basis in fact.  Although the external aspects of a historical figure may be well documented, their inner nature can only be a subject of speculation.  With religious figures, often the subjects of voluminous literature, separating "fact" from "belief" can be difficult if not impossible.

===Ancient figures===
With older texts it can be difficult to be sure whether a person in the text is, in fact, a historical figure. "Wisdom literature" from early middle-eastern cultures (such as the [[Book of Job]]), mainly consist of verbal expositions or discussions that must be considered the work of the author, rather than the character supposedly speaking. It may still be possible to identify a figure in such texts with a historical figure known from some other context, and the text may be taken as informative about this figure, even if not verified by an independent source.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=335}} On the other hand, a text may include realistic settings and references to historical people, while the central character may or may not be a historical figure.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=336}}

===Fables===
[[File:Lady Godiva (John Collier, c. 1897).jpg|thumb|[[Lady Godiva]] was a historical figure, but there is no evidence that the legend of her riding naked through the streets is true (''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'' painting, 1897 by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]])]]

Napoleon spoke of history as being a [[fable]] which had been agreed upon:– "''la fable convenue qu'on appellera l'histoire''".{{sfn|Napoleon &amp; Auguste-Dieudonné 1823|p=242}} Great figures of the past have stories told about them which grow in the telling, and so become [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s which may dominate or displace the more prosaic historical facts about them. For example, some ancient chroniclers said that the Emperor [[Nero]] fiddled while Rome burned, but [[Tacitus]] disputed this by saying the stories were just malicious rumours. Similarly, there is no good evidence that [[Marie Antoinette]] ever said "let them eat cake", or that [[Lady Godiva]] rode naked through the streets of [[Coventry]].{{sfn|Andrews|2012}}

===Personality===
[[Thomas Carlyle]] pointed out that even to the person living it, every life "remains in so many points unintelligible".  The historian must struggle when writing biographies, "the very facts of which, to say nothing of the purport of them, we know not, and cannot know!"{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=133-134}}
Some psychologists have sought to understand the personalities of historical figures through clues about the way in which they were raised. However, this theoretical psychoanalytic approach is not supported empirically. An alternative approach, favored by [[Psychobiography|psychobiographers]] such as [[William Runyan]], is to explain the personality of the historical figure in terms of their life history. This approach has the advantage of recognizing that personality may evolve over time in response to events.{{sfn|Roberts|1996|p=208}}

[[File:Confucius Laozi Buddha.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Three great historical figures — [[Confucius]] presenting the [[Buddha]] to [[Lao Tsu]]. They are all of such antiquity that the historical facts about them are now overlaid with centuries of myth and legend.]]

===Religious figures===
With historical religious figures, fact and belief may be difficult to disentangle.
There are cultural differences in the treatment of historical figures. Thus the Chinese can recognise that [[Mencius]] or [[Confucius]] were historical individuals, while also endowing them with sanctity. In Indian [[Hinduism]], on the other hand, figures such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]] are almost always seen as embodiments of gods rather than as historical people. The [[Nirvana Sutra]] states: "Do not rely on the man but on the Dharma." A teacher such as [[Gautama Buddha]] is thus treated almost exclusively as a lesser god rather than a historical figure.{{sfn|Yuasa|Kasulis|1987|p=128}}

[[E. P. Sanders]], author of ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'', called Jesus of Nazareth "one of the most important figures in human history".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=1}} Various writers have struggled to present [[Historical Jesus|"historical" views of Jesus]], as opposed to views distorted by belief.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}} When writing about this subject, a historian who relies only on sources other than the [[New Testament]] may be criticized for implying that it is not a sufficient source of information about the subject.{{sfn|Habermas|1996|p=11}}

The theologian [[Martin Kähler]] is known for his work ''Der sogenannte historische Jesus und der geschichtliche, biblische Christus'' (The so-called historical Jesus, and the historic, biblical Christ). He clearly distinguished between "the Jesus of history" and "the Christ of faith".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=4}} Some historians openly admit bias, which may anyway be unavoidable. Paul Hollenback says he writes about the historical Jesus, "...in order to overthrow, not simply correct, the mistake called Christianity."  Another historian who has written about Jesus, Frederick Gaiser, says, "historical investigation is part and parcel of biblical faith."{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}}

==Political appropriation==
[[File:Stilke Hermann Anton - Joan of Arc's Death at the Stake.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1843 view of a heroic [[Joan of Arc]] at the stake.]]
A historical figure may be interpreted to support political aims.
In France in the first half of the seventeenth century,&lt;!--didn't the big Joan thing take place around the time of Napoleon?--&gt; there was an outpouring of writing about [[Joan of Arc]], including seven biographies, three plays and an epic poem. Joan had become a symbol of national pride and the Catholic faith, helping unite a country that had been divided by the recent [[French Wars of Religion|wars of religion]].  The reality of the historical Joan was subordinated to the need for a symbol of feminine strength, Christian virtue and resistance to the English.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=1}}
[[George Bernard Shaw]], introducing his 1923 play ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', discussed representations of Joan by other authors.
He felt that [[William Shakespeare]]'s depiction in ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' was constrained from making her a "beautiful and romantic figure" by political considerations. [[Voltaire]]'s version in his poem ''[[La Pucelle d'Orléans]]'' was also flawed by Voltaire's biases and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s play ''[[Die Jungfrau von Orleans]]'' "is not about Joan at all, and can hardly be said to pretend to be."{{sfn|Innes|1998|p=208}}

A historical figure may be used to validate a politician's claim to authority,
where the modern leader shapes and exploits the ideas associated with the historical figure,
which they are presumed to have inherited.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=60}}
Thus [[Jesse Jackson]] has frequently evoked the spirit of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=51}}
[[Fidel Castro]] often presented himself as following the path defined by [[José Martí]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=64}}
[[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela has frequently identified himself with the historical figure [[Simón Bolívar]], the liberator of South America from Spanish rule.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=125}}

Hegel believed in the role of the state in guaranteeing individual liberties, and his views were therefore rejected by the German National Socialists, who considered him dangerously liberal and perhaps a proto-Marxist. On the other hand, [[Adolf Hitler]] identified himself as a Hegelian world historical figure, and justified his actions on this basis.{{sfn|Cobley|2002|p=278}}

==In education==
[[Plato]] used historical figures in his writing, but only to illustrate his points. [[Xenophon]] used [[Cyrus the Great]] in the same way.
When Plato apparently quotes [[Socrates]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', it is only to add dramatic effect to the presentation of his own thought.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} For this reason, Plato's writings on Socrates tell us little, at least directly, about Socrates. The historical figure is used only as a device for communicating Plato's ideas.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} In classical Rome, students of rhetoric had to master the ''[[suasoria]]'' — a form of [[declamation]] in which they wrote the soliloquy of a historical figure who was debating a critical course of action.  For example, the poet [[Juvenal]] wrote a speech for the dictator [[Sulla]], in which he was counselled to retire. The poet [[Ovid]] enjoyed this exercise more than the other final challenge — the ''[[controversia]]''.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics|p=212}}

The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote an influential essay "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life". He said "the unhistorical and historical are necessary in equal measure for the health of an individual, of a people and of a culture."{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=2}}
Nietzsche identifies three approaches to history, each with dangers.
The monumental approach describes the glories of the past, often focusing on heroic figures like [[Elizabeth I of England]] or [[Louis Pasteur]]. 
By treating these figures as models, the student is tempted to consider that there can be nobody of such stature today.
The antiquarian view examines the past in minute and reverent detail, turning its back on the present.
The critical approach challenges traditional views, even though they may be valid.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=3}}

Historical figures may today be simulated as [[animated pedagogical agent]]s to teach history and foreign culture. An example is [[Freudbot]], which acted the part of [[Sigmund Freud]] for psychology students. When a variety of simulated character types were tried as educational agents, students rated historical figures as the most engaging.{{sfn|Veletsianos|2010|p=16}}
There are [[gender difference]]s in the perception of historical figures.  When modern US schoolchildren were asked to roleplay or illustrate historical stereotypes, boys tended to focus upon male figures exclusively while girls showed more varied family groupings.{{sfn|Fournier|Wineburg|1997|p=160-185}}

==In branding==
Using historical figures in marketing communicationsn and in branding is a new area of marketing research but historical figures’ names were used to promote products as early as in the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;Madow M., Private Ownership of Public Image: Popular Culture and Publicity Rights, vol. 81, California Law Review 125, 1993, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Historical figure brand is using famous historical person in branding, for instance [[Mozartkugel]], [[Chopin (vodka)]] or Café Einstein https://www.cafeeinstein.com/. 

Historical figure is a person who lived in the past and whose deeds exerted a significant impact on other people’s lives and consciousness. These figures are attributed with certain features that are a compilation of the actual values they proclaimed and the manner they were perceived by others. This perception evolves and subsequent generations read the biography of a given historical figure in their own way through their own knowledge and experience. In order to determine the popularity of the commercialisation of historical figures, a study was conducted at the beginning of 2014 on the number of trademark protection applications filed with the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland as a measure of entrepreneurs’ interest in this activity. The names of 300 most prominent Polish historical figures &lt;ref&gt;Grygiel A.(ed.), Encyklopedia sławnych Polaków, Publicat S.A., Poznań 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; were considered. The study showed that over 21% of the names analysed were recorded in the trademark register. 1,033 trademark protection applications were filed for 64 names out of the 300 historical figures investigated [Aldona Lipka, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Lipka Aldona, Ograniczona racjonalność i heurystyki w zachowaniach nabywców [w:] G. Wolska (red.), Współczesne problemy ekonomiczne, Zeszyty Naukowe nr 858, Wyd. Uniwersytet Szczeciński, Szczecin 2015. p. 265.(https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=8g7DDDkAAAAJ&amp;hl=pl&amp;oi=ao)&lt;/ref&gt;]. The greatest number of trademark protection applications were recorded for [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]] (295), followed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (250), [[John III Sobieski]] (94) and [[Chopin]] (81).

==In art and literature==
[[File:Henry IV 1 title page.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Shakespeare]] wrote a number of plays that dramatized the lives of historical figures, but introduced fictional characters such as [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]].]]

===Realist historical fiction===
There is a huge body of historical fiction, where the text includes both imaginary and factual elements. In early English literature, [[Robin Hood]] was a fictional character, but the historical King [[Richard I of England]] also appears.{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xviii}}
[[William Shakespeare]]{{efn|William Shakespeare was a historical figure himself, but as a biographer said, "Such materials as there are for Shakespeare's personal history, or for the history of anyone connected with him, have been gathered with the most loving and persevering industry. Unhappily, they amount to very little.  Entries in municipal records, names in a will, a lease, or an inventory, tell hardly anything of the life or character of the man.  That orange has now been squeezed dry."{{sfn|Smith|1899|p=7}}}} wrote [[List of historical figures dramatised by Shakespeare|plays about people who were historical figures in his day]], such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. He did not present these people as pure history, but dramatised their lives as a commentary about the people and politics of his own time.{{sfn|Hattaway|2002|p=16}}
Napoleon figured in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 classic ''[[Les Misérables]]''.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=65}}
There are many more examples.

The compiler of a survey of historical novels in the 1920s claimed that the "appearance of reality ... is the great charm of the historical novel." He went on to assert, regarding novels about periods of which little is known, that "the danger is that the very elements which add to our interest in the tale as such will go far to mislead us in our conception of the period dealt with".{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xix}}
Traditionally the treatment of historical figures in fiction was realistic in style and respectful of fact. A historical novel would be true to the facts known about the period in which the novel is set, a [[biographical novel]] would follow the facts that are known about the protagonist's life, and a "[[roman à clef]]" would try to give an accurate interpretation of what is known about a public figure's private life. In each genre, the novelist would avoid introducing any elements that were clearly in conflict with the facts.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}

A writer may be handicapped by his readers' preconceptions about a historical person, which may or may not be accurate, and the facts about the historical person may also conflict with the novelist's plot requirements.{{sfn|Lukacs|1937|p=168}}
According to the Marxist philosopher [[György Lukács]] in his 1937 book on ''The Historical Novel'', "The 'world-historical individual' can only figure as a minor character in the [historical] novel because of the complexity and intricacy of the whole social-historical process."{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=113}}
As Jacobs observes, the "realist aesthetic" of the historical novel "assumes that a recognizable historical figure in fiction must not 'do things' its model did not do in real life; it follows that historical figures can be used only in very limited ways."{{sfn|Wyile|2002|p=16}}
The author of a traditional historical novel should therefore focus more on the people who have been lost to history.{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=112}}
A novelist such as Sir [[Walter Scott]] or [[Leo Tolstoy]] (''[[War and Peace]]'') would describe historical events accurately. They would give rein to their imagination only in scenes that were not significant historically, when interactions with fictional characters could safely be introduced.{{sfn|Wachtel|1995|p=114}}

===Modern fiction===
More recently, however, starting with works such as ''[[The Confessions of Nat Turner]]'', and ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]'' by [[William Styron]],
the novelist has felt more free to introduce much larger amounts of purely imaginary detail about historical people.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}
[[E. L. Doctorow]] illustrates this different attitude when discussing his book ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'': "Certain details were so delicious that I was scrupulous about getting them right. Others&amp;nbsp;... demanded to be mythologized."  This reflects a changing attitude about the distinction between "fact" and "truth", expressed by [[Ursule Molinaro]] when he makes his [[Cassandra]] say, "I've come as close to the truth as facts would let me ... facts oppress the truth, which can breathe freely only in poetry &amp; art."{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xvii}}

===Other media===
Many films have depicted historical figures.  Often the way in which the films interpret these figures and their times reflects the social and cultural values of the period in which the film was made.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=1}}
Historical figures are familiar to the general reader and so may be used in [[speculative fiction]] so that readers marvel at their appearance in novel settings or with a fresh perspective.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=111ff}}
For example, the time traveler [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] has encountered numerous historical figures such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in his adventures.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gee|2012}}
They appeared most frequently when the television series first started, as it was directed at children and the use of historical figures in historical settings was intended to be educational.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=19}}

      <text bytes="10445" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Form of collective memory defined by shared experiences and culture}}
'''National memory''' is a form of [[collective memory]] defined by shared experiences and culture. It is an integral part to [[national identity]].

It represents one specific form of [[cultural memory]], which makes an essential contribution to national [[group cohesion]]. Historically national communities have drawn upon commemorative ceremonies and monuments, [[myth]]s and rituals, glorified individuals, objects, and events in their own history to produce a common narrative&lt;!--worldview, conception--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memory, History, and Colonialism|url=https://www.ghil.ac.uk/fileadmin/redaktion/dokumente/bulletin/GHIL%20Bulletin%20Supplement%201%20(2009).pdf|publisher=German Historical Institute London|accessdate=3 March 2017|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lorraine Ryan, national memory is based on the public's reception of national historic narratives and the ability of people to affirm the legitimacy of these narratives.
&lt;!--'''National remembrance''' ...--&gt;

==Conflicting versions, dynamicity, manipulation and subjectivity==
National memory typically consists of a shared interpretation of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=prague&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paces|first1=Cynthia|title=Prague Panoramas: National Memory and Sacred Space in the Twentieth Century|date=September 2009|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=9780822977674|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZztTm-zrjIYC|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interpretations can vary and sometimes compete.&lt;ref name=prague/&gt; They can get challenged and augmented by a range of interest groups, fighting to have their histories acknowledged, documented and commemorated and reshape national stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weedon|first1=Chris|last2=Jordan|first2=Glenn|title=Collective memory: theory and politics|journal=Social Semiotics|date=April 2012|volume=22|issue=2|pages=143–153|doi=10.1080/10350330.2012.664969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often national memory is adjusted to offer a politicized vision of the past to make a political position appear consistent with national identity.&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graber|first1=Samuel J.|title=Twice-divided Nation: The Civil War and National Memory in the Transatlantic World|isbn=9781109024135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S7oq4-MZcr4C|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it profoundly affects how historical facts are perceived and recorded and may circumvent or appropriate facts.&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt; A repertoire of discursive strategies functions to emotionalize national narrative and nationalize personal pasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Geoffrey M.|title=Emotional Remembering: The Pragmatics of National Memory|journal=Ethos|date=December 1999|volume=27|issue=4|pages=505–529|doi=10.1525/eth.1999.27.4.505|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229796645|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National memory has been used calculatedly by governments for dynastic, political, religious and cultural purposes since as early as the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillis|first1=John R.|title=Commemorations: The Politics of National Identity|year=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691029253|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WAB4sd2nFyMC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing of memory by the [[culture industry]] and its instrumentalisation for political purposes can both be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;

Lorraine Ryan notes that individual memory both shapes and is shaped by national memory, and that there is a competition between the dominant and individual memories of a nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Lorraine|title=Cosmopolitan memory and national memory conflicts: On the dynamics of their interaction|journal=Journal of Sociology|date=28 November 2012|volume=50|issue=4|pages=501–514|doi=10.1177/1440783312467097|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyung Park states that the nation is continuously revived, re-imagined, reconstituted, through shared memories among its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Hyung yu|title=Shared national memory as intangible heritage|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|date=April 2011|volume=38|issue=2|pages=520–539|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2010.11.013|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256987216|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National memories may also conflict&lt;!--/collide--&gt; with the other nations' collective memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pomian|first1=Krzysztof|title=Divided memory: European sites of memory as political and cultural phenomenon|url=http://www.enrs.eu/pl/articles/219-divided-memory|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=pl-pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the media==
Reports that are narrated&lt;!--/written--&gt; in terms of national memory characterize the past in ways that merge the past, the present and the future into "a single ongoing tale".&lt;ref name="medmem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garde-Hansen|first1=Joanne|title=Media and Memory|date=29 June 2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748688883|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xdpvAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Nora]] argues that a "democratisation of history" allows for emancipatory versions of the past to surface:&lt;ref name=ww2.0&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruyn|first1=Dieter De|title=World War 2.0: Commemorating War and Holocaust in Poland through Facebook|journal=Digital Icons|issn=2043-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|National memory cannot come into being until the historical framework of the nation has been shattered. It reflects the abandonment of the traditional channels and modes of transmission of the past and the desacralisation of such primary sites of initiation as the school, the family, the museum, and the monument: what was once the responsibility of these institutions has now flowed over into the public domain and been taken over by the media and tourist industry|source=Nora 1998, 363&lt;ref name="medmem"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;}}
&lt;!--More: &lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;--&gt;

However, national history being passed on by the culture industry, such as by [[historical films]], can be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;

===International media===
{{See also|Global news flow|Category:Cultural exchange|International communication}}
Nations' memories can be shared across nations via media such as the [[Internet]]&lt;!-- and thereby help globalize national memories--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ANDREWS|first1=MAGGIE|last2=BAGOT-JEWITT|first2=CHARLIE|last3=HUNT|first3=NIGEL|title=Introduction: National memory and war|journal=Journal of War &amp; Culture Studies|date=8 December 2011|volume=4|issue=3|pages=283–288|doi=10.1386/jwcs.4.3.283_7|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269606175|language=en|issn=1752-6272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects and functions ==
National memory can be a force of cohesion as well as division and conflict. It can foster constructive national reforms, international communities and agreements,&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt; dialogue as well as deepen problematic courses and rhetoric.

[[Identity crisis]] can occur due to bad memories (such as national crimes)&lt;!--cn--&gt; or the absence of a belief in a shared past.&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Often new developments, processes, problems and events are [[Sensemaking|made sense of]] and contextualized by drawing from national memory.

== Critical national memory ==
Critical history or historic memory cuts from national memory's tradition centric to national heritage and orients itself towards a specialized study of history in a more [[sociological]] [[Historical sociology|manner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koshar|first1=Rudy J.|title=Germany's Transient Pasts: Preservation and National Memory in the Twentieth Century|date=9 November 2000|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807862629|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yVzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that the unthinkable ought not to be unmasked but that instead what made it thinkable should be reconstructed and that the difficulty of discussing the non-places or the bad places of national memory make it necessary to include forgetfulness and amnesia in the concept.&lt;ref name=places&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montaño|first1=Eugenia Allier|title=Places of memory. Is the concept applicable to the analysis of memorial struggles? The case of Uruguay and its recent past|url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/pdf/s_cclaeh/v4nse/scs_a01.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

National memory may lead to questioning the nation as it is as well as its identity and imply a societal negotiation of what the country wishes to be as a nation. To understand the links between memory, forgetfulness, identity and the imaginary construction of the nation analysis of the discourse in the places of memory is fundamental as in all writings of national history an image of the nation is being restructured.&lt;ref name=places/&gt;

{{term|[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]}}
{{defn|A Roman family name best known for being used by several rulers of [[Ancient Rome]]. Contrary to popular opinion, the name "Caesar" did not originally mean "emperor", although in modern times it has come to be defined as a synonym for autocrat. When the Roman leader [[Gaius Julius Caesar]] was assassinated in 44 BCE, his nephew and successor [[Augustus]] had himself formally adopted by the dead man and so also adopted the family name Caesar. [[Tiberius]] and [[Caligula]] inherited it by adoption as well. Later Roman emperors acquired the name upon their succession or when they were formally adopted as heirs.}}

==By ideological classification (historiography)==
Although there is arguably some intrinsic [[bias]] in history studies (with [[nationalism|national]] bias perhaps being the most significant), history can also be studied from [[ideology|ideological]] perspectives, which practitioners feel are often ignored, such as:
*[[Marxist historiography]]
*[[Feminist history]] (also called ''herstory'').

A form of historical speculation known commonly as [[counterfactual history]] has also been adopted by some historians as a means of assessing and exploring the possible outcomes if certain events had not occurred or had occurred in a different way. This is somewhat similar to the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] genre in fiction.

Lists of false or dubious historical resources and [[historical myths]] that were once popular and widespread, or have become so, have also been prepared.

'''Historical significance''' is a [[historiography|historiographical]] concept that defines and influences the social remembrance of past events. 

Historians consider knowledge of dates and events the primary content of history, or "first-order knowledge". They class historical significance as an aspect of the study of primary content, deeming it secondary or "second-order knowledge". However, the way dates and events are chosen and described is often used to assign significance, without acknowledging bias.{{citationneeded|date=June 2019}} As [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Michel Foucault]] have said: "[[History is written by the victors]]".   

==Relevance==

A central topic to the study of history, historical significance defines what is remembered about the past, through its reflections in various objects of contemporary culture (images on stamps and banknotes, street names, etc.) Examining it can be an effective tool for guiding students to understand how cultural background affects perception of history and the preferences they have.&lt;ref name="newapp"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1073987.pdf |author= Stephanie Levesque |title= Teaching second-order concepts in Canadian history: The importance of "historical significance" |publisher= University of Western Ontario |date= Winter 2005 |accessdate= 14 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430145210/https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1073987.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Historical significance is typically assessed by judging an event against pre-defined criteria. For example, [[UNESCO]] includes any site as a world heritage site, provided it "bear[s] a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization".&lt;ref name="edgehill"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/histlearn/files/2015/01/DebatingHistoricalSignificance.pdf|title=Debating Historical Significance|publisher=Edge Hill University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315052714/https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/histlearn/files/2015/01/DebatingHistoricalSignificance.pdf|archivedate=15 March 2019|url-status=live|accessdate=12 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these criteria are often subjective and perception-biased ''or'' unavailable.&lt;ref name="edgehill" /&gt; Thus the alluding of any event as historically significant or non-significant remains open to challenge.&lt;ref name="edgehill" /&gt;

Numerous criteria for assessing historical significance have been proposed.&lt;ref name="counsell"&gt;&lt;cite class="citation web"&gt;[http://www.sites.hps.cam.ac.uk/whipple/gallerychallenge/forteachers/lessonnotes/ "Lesson notes"].

{{For|the work by H. G. Wells|The Outline of History}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to history:

'''[[History]]''' – discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented (the beginning of [[recorded history]]).

== Nature of history ==
History can be described as all of the following:
* [[Academic discipline]] – body of knowledge given to – or received by – a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] – academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

===Essence of history===
* [[Chronology]] &amp;ndash; science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time, such as in [[historical timeline]]s.
* [[Past]] &amp;ndash; totality of events which occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. The past is the domain of history.
* [[Time]] &amp;ndash; measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. History describes what happened where, but also when (in time) those events took place.

== Historical disciplines ==&lt;!-- This section is accessed by lua module to populate a section on Portal:History. Please do not change this heading, as doing so will break that portal. --&gt;

'''Progress''' is the movement towards a refined, improved, or otherwise desired state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/progress |title = Progress definition and meaning &amp;#124; Collins English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/progress |title = Progress &amp;#124; Meaning of Progress by Lexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/progress | title=PROGRESS &amp;#124; meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[progressivism]], it refers to the proposition that advancements in [[technology]], [[science]], and [[social organization]] have resulted, and by extension will continue to result, in an improved [[human condition]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/progress/|title=Progress definition|last=|first=|chapter=Progress|website=|year=2019|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|url-status=live|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter may happen as a result of direct human action, as in [[social enterprise]] or through [[activism]], or as a natural part of [[sociocultural evolution]].

The concept of progress was introduced in the early 19th-century [[social theory|social theories]], especially [[social evolution]] as described by [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. It was present in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s [[philosophy of history|philosophies of history]]. As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.

==Measuring progress==
Specific indicators for measuring progress can range from economic data, technical innovations, change in the political or legal system, and questions bearing on individual life chances, such as life expectancy and risk of disease and disability.

[[GDP]] growth has become a key orientation for politics and is often taken as a key figure to evaluate a politician's performance. However, GDP has a number of flaws that make it a bad measure of progress, especially for developed countries. For example, environmental damage is not taken into account nor is the [[sustainability]] of economic activity. [[Wikiprogress]] has been set up to share information on evaluating societal progress. It aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas, initiatives and knowledge. [http://www.humanprogress.org/ HumanProgress.org] is another online resource that seeks to compile data on different measures of societal progress.

[[Our World in Data]] is a scientific [[Electronic publishing|online publication]], based at the [[University of Oxford]], that studies how to make progress against large [[List of global issues|global problems]] such as poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/about|title=About|website=Our World in Data|access-date=2019-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Progress Index]] is a tool developed by the International Organization Imperative Social Progress, which measures the extent to which countries cover social and environmental needs of its citizenry. There are fifty-two indicators in three areas or dimensions: Basic Human Needs, and Foundations of Wellbeing and Opportunities which show the relative performance of nations.

Indices that can be used to measure progress include:
{{div col}}
* [[Broad measures of economic progress]]
* [[Disability-adjusted life year]]
* [[Green national product]]
* [[Gender-related Development Index]]
* [[Genuine Progress Indicator]]
* [[Gross National Happiness]]

==Scientific progress==
{{see also|History of science|Technological change|Invention}}
'''Scientific progress''' is the idea that the scientific community learns more over time, which causes a body of [[scientific knowledge]] to accumulate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wesseling|first=Henk|date=August 1998|title=History: Science or art?|journal=European Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=265–267|doi=10.1017/S106279870000329X|issn=1474-0575|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemists in the 19th century knew less about chemistry than the chemists in the 20th century, and they in turn knew less than the chemists in the 21st century. Looking forward, today's chemists reasonably expect that chemists in future centuries will know more than they do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

This process differs from [[non-science]] fields, such as human languages or history:  the people who spoke a now-extinct language, or who lived through a historical time period, can be said to have known different things from the scholars who studied it later, but they cannot be said to know less about their lives than the modern scholars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some valid knowledge is lost through the passage of time, and other knowledge is gained, with the result that the non-science fields do not make scientific progress towards understanding their subject areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge, in which true theories replaced false beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Golinski |first=Jan  |year=2001 |title=Making Natural Knowledge: Constructivism and the History of Science |edition= reprint |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226302324 |page=2 | quote=When [history of science] began, during the eighteenth century, it was practiced by scientists (or "natural philosophers") with an interest in validating and defending their enterprise.  They wrote histories in which ... the science of the day was exhibited as the outcome of the progressive accumulation of human knowledge, which was an integral part of moral and cultural development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of [[Thomas Kuhn]], tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix of intellectual, cultural, economic and political trends. These interpretations, however, have met with opposition for they also portray the history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms, not leading to any scientific progress, but only to the illusion of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137: "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social progress==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Aspects of social progress, as described by [[Condorcet]], have included the disappearance of [[abolitionism|slavery]], the rise of [[literacy]], the lessening of [[gender inequalities|inequalities]] between the sexes, [[prison reform|reforms]] of harsh prisons and the decline of [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The social progress of a society can be measured based on factors such as its ability to address fundamental [[human need]]s, help citizens improve their [[quality of life]], and provide [[business opportunities|opportunities]] for citizens to succeed.&lt;ref name="WEF"/&gt;

Social progress is often improved by increases in GDP, although other factors are also relevant. An imbalance between economic and social progress hinders further economic progress, and can lead to political instability.&lt;ref name="WEF"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Why social progress matters| author = Porter M| work = World Economic Forum| date = 10 April 2015| access-date = 17 February 2020| url = https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/04/why-social-progress-matters/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of women===
How progress improved the status of women in traditional society was a major theme of historians starting in the Enlightenment and continuing to today.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Ann Taylor (1999). "Feminism, Social Science, and the Meanings of Modernity: the Debate on the Origin of the Family in Europe and the United States, 1860–914," ''American Historical Review'' '''104''' (4): 1085–113; Nyland, Chris (1993). "Adam Smith, Stage Theory, and the Status of Women," ''History of Political Economy'' '''25''' (4): 617–40.&lt;/ref&gt; British theorists [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] (1721–1793) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797), along with many of their contemporaries, remained committed to Christian- and [[republicanism|republican-based]] conceptions of virtue, while working within a new Enlightenment paradigm. The political agenda related beauty, taste, and morality to the imperatives and needs of modern societies of a high level of sophistication and differentiation. Two themes in the work of Robertson and Burke—the nature of women in 'savage' and 'civilized' societies and 'beauty in distress'—reveals how long-held convictions about the character of women, especially with regard to their capacity and right to appear in the public domain, were modified and adjusted to the idea of progress and became central to modern European civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Kontler, László (2004). "Beauty or Beast, or Monstrous Regiments? Robertson and Burke on Women and the Public Scene," ''Modern Intellectual History'' '''1''' (3): 305–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classics experts have examined the status of women in the ancient world, concluding that in the Roman Empire, with its superior social organization, internal peace, and rule of law, allowed women to enjoy a somewhat better standing than in ancient Greece, where women were distinctly inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, Robert William, &amp; Chris Nyland (2003). ''The Status of Women in Classical Economic Thought''. Edward Elgar Publishing, p. 109; Ryrie, Charles Caldwell (1958). ''The Place of Women in the Church'', The Macmillan Company, Ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The inferior status of women in traditional China has raised the issue of whether the idea of progress requires a thoroughgoing reject of traditionalism—a belief held by many Chinese reformers in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vernoff, Edward, &amp; Peter J. Seybolt, (2007). ''Through Chinese Eyes: Tradition, Revolution, and Transformation'', APEX Press, pp. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians Leo Marx and [[Bruce Mazlish]] asking, "Should we in fact abandon the idea of progress as a view of the past," answer that there is no doubt "that the status of women has improved markedly" in cultures that have adopted the Enlightenment idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Leo, &amp; Bruce Mazlish (1998). ''Progress: Fact or Illusion?''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernization==
{{main|Modernization}}
Modernization was promoted by [[classical liberals]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to free markets and free movements of people.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, Joyce; Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob (1995). ''Telling the Truth about History''. W.W. Norton, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe [[social commentary|social commentators]] and [[philosopher]]s began to realize that people ''themselves'' could change society and change their way of life. Instead of being made completely by gods, there was increasing room for the idea that people themselves ''made their own society''—and not only that, as [[Giambattista Vico]] argued, ''because'' people made their own society, they could also fully comprehend it. This gave rise to new sciences, or [[proto-science]]s, which claimed to provide new scientific knowledge about what society was like, and how one may change it for the better.&lt;ref&gt;The following annotated reference list appears in [[J. B. Bury]]'s study: ''The Idea of Progress,'' published in 1920 and [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4557/4557-h/4557-h.htm available in full on the web]:
{{Quote|The history of the idea of Progress has been treated briefly and partially by various French writers; e.g. Comte, {{lang|fr|Cours de philosophie positive}}, vi. 321 sqq.; Buchez, {{lang|fr|Introduction a la science de l'histoire}}, i. 99 sqq. (ed. 2, 1842); Javary, {{lang|fr|De l'idee de progres}} (1850); Rigault, {{lang|fr|Histoire de la querelle des Anciens et des Modernes}} (1856); Bouillier, {{lang|fr|Histoire de la philosophie cartesienne}} (1854); Caro, {{lang|fr|Problemes de la morale sociale}} (1876); Brunetiere, "{{lang|fr|La Formation de l'idee de progres|italic=no}}", in {{lang|fr|Etudes critiques}}, 5e serie. More recently M. Jules Delvaille has attempted to trace its history fully, down to the end of the eighteenth century. His {{lang|fr|Histoire de l'idee de progres}} (1910) is planned on a large scale; he is erudite and has read extensively. But his treatment is lacking in the power of discrimination. He strikes one as anxious to bring within his net, as {{lang|fr|theoriciens du progres}}, as many distinguished thinkers as possible; and so, along with a great deal that is useful and relevant, we also find in his book much that is irrelevant. He has not clearly seen that the distinctive idea of Progress was not conceived in antiquity or in the Middle Ages, or even in the Renaissance period; and when he comes to modern times he fails to bring out clearly the decisive steps of its growth. And he does not seem to realize that a man might be "progressive" without believing in, or even thinking about, the doctrine of Progress. Leonardo da Vinci and Berkeley are examples. In my ''Ancient Greek Historians'' (1909) I dwelt on the modern origin of the idea (p. 253 sqq.). Recently Mr. R. H. Murray, in a learned appendix to his ''Erasmus and Luther'', has developed the thesis that Progress was not grasped in antiquity (though he makes an exception of Seneca),—a welcome confirmation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, this gave rise to [[Progressivism|progressive]] opinion, in contrast with conservational opinion. The social conservationists were skeptical about [[panacea]]s for social ills. According to conservatives, attempts to radically remake society normally make things worse. [[Edmund Burke]] was the leading exponent of this, although later-day liberals like [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] have espoused similar views. They argue that society changes organically and naturally, and that grand plans for the remaking of society, like the [[French Revolution]], [[National Socialism]] and [[Communism]] hurt society by removing the traditional constraints on the exercise of power.

The scientific advances of the 16th and 17th centuries provided a basis for [[Francis Bacon|Francis Bacon's]] book the [[New Atlantis]]. In the 17th century, [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] described progress with respect to arts and the sciences, saying that each age has the advantage of not having to rediscover what was accomplished in preceding ages. The epistemology of [[John Locke]] provided further support and was popularized by the Encyclopedists [[Diderot]], [[Holbach]], and [[Condorcet]]. Locke had a powerful influence on the American [[Founding Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, Thomas L. (1990). ''The Spirit of Modern Republicanism: The Moral Vision of the American Founders and the Philosophy of Locke''. University of Chicago Press. {{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete statement of progress is that of [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], in his "A Philosophical Review of the Successive Advances of the Human Mind" (1750). For Turgot, progress covers not only the arts and sciences but, on their base, the whole of culture—manner, mores, institutions, legal codes, economy, and society. [[Condorcet]] predicted the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]]'s (1806–1873) ethical and political thought demonstrated faith in the power of ideas and of intellectual education for improving human nature or behavior. For those who do not share this faith the idea of progress becomes questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1980) pp. 224–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Marshall]] (1842–1924), a British economist of the early 20th century, was a proponent of classical liberalism. In his highly influential ''Principles of Economics'' (1890), he was deeply interested in human progress and in what is now called ''sustainable development.'' For Marshall, the importance of wealth lay in its ability to promote the physical, mental, and moral health of the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Caldari, Katia (2004). "Alfred Marshall's Idea of Progress and Sustainable Development," ''Journal of the History of Economic Thought'', '''26''' (4): 519–36.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the modernization and development programs undertaken in the Third World were typically based on the idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, H. W. (1989). ''Economic Development: The History of an Idea''. University of Chicago Press. {{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia the notion of progress was first imported from the West by [[Peter the Great]] (1672–1725). An absolute ruler, he used the concept to modernize Russia and to legitimize his monarchy (unlike its usage in Western Europe, where it was primarily associated with political opposition). By the early 19th century, the notion of progress was being taken up by Russian intellectuals and was no longer accepted as legitimate by the tsars. Four schools of thought on progress emerged in 19th-century Russia: conservative (reactionary), religious, liberal, and socialist—the latter winning out in the form of Bolshevist materialism.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Herbert J. (1965). "Economic Modernization in Imperial Russia: Purposes and Achievements," ''Journal of Economic History'' '''25''' (4): 523–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual leaders of the American Revolution, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], were immersed in Enlightenment thought and believed the idea of progress meant that they could reorganize the political system to the benefit of the human condition; both for Americans and also, as Jefferson put it, for an "[[Empire of Liberty]]" that would benefit all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele (1969). [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44497969.pdf "The Past as an Extension of the Present,"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Adams wrote “I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.”{{fact|date=May 2019}}

[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]] (1810–1884) was one of the most influential political theorists in Argentina. Economic liberalism was the key to his idea of progress. He promoted faith in progress, while chiding fellow Latin Americans for blind copying of American and European models. He hoped for progress through promotion of immigration, education, and a moderate type of federalism and republicanism that might serve as a transition in Argentina to true democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, John E. (1973). "Juan Bautista Alberdi: A Study of His Thought," ''Americas'' '''29''' (4): 489–501.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, [[José María Luis Mora]] (1794–1850) was a leader of [[classical liberalism]] in the first generation after independence, leading the battle against the conservative trinity of the army, the church, and the ''hacendados''. He envisioned progress as both a process of human development by the search for philosophical truth and as the introduction of an era of material prosperity by technological advancement. His plan for Mexican reform demanded a republican government bolstered by widespread popular education free of clerical control, confiscation and sale of ecclesiastical lands as a means of redistributing income and clearing government debts, and effective control of a reduced military force by the government. Mora also demanded the establishment of legal equality between native Mexicans and foreign residents. His program, untried in his lifetime, became the key element in the Mexican Constitution of 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, John M. (1972). "Jose Mora: His Idea of Progress and the Origins of Mexican Liberalism," ''North Dakota Quarterly'' '''40''' (2): 22–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the idea that progress in science and technology would lead to solutions for human ills was connected to the nationalism that united the country in 1860. The Piedmontese Prime Minister Camillo Cavour envisaged the railways as a major factor in the modernization and unification of the Italian peninsula. The new Kingdom of Italy, formed in 1861, worked to speed up the processes of modernization and industrialization that had begun in the north, but were slow to arrive in the Papal States and central Italy, and were nowhere in sight in the "Mezzogiorno" (that is, Southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia). The government sought to combat the backwardness of the poorer regions in the south and work towards augmenting the size and quality of the newly created Italian army so that it could compete on an equal footing with the powerful nations of Europe. In the same period, the government was legislating in favour of public education to fight the great problem of illiteracy, upgrade the teaching classes, improve existing schools, and procure the funds needed for social hygiene and care of the body as factors in the physical and moral regeneration of the race.&lt;ref&gt;DalLago, Enrico (2002). ''The American South and the Italian Mezzogiorno: Essays in Comparative History''. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, in the 20th century the [[Kuomintang]] or Nationalist party, which ruled from the 1920s to the 1940s, advocated progress. The Communists under [[Mao Zedong]] adopted western models and their ruinous projects caused [[Great Chinese Famine|mass famines]]. After Mao's death, however, the new regime led by [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1904–1997) and his successors aggressively promoted modernization of the economy using capitalist models and imported western technology.&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov, Dmitry (2004). "Deng Xiaoping and the Modernization of China," ''Far Eastern Affairs'' '''32''' (4): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was termed the "Opening of China" in the west, and more broadly encompasses [[Chinese economic reform]].

Among environmentalists, there is a continuum between two opposing poles. The one pole is optimistic, progressive, and business-oriented, and endorses the classic idea of progress. For example, [[bright green environmentalism]] endorses the idea that new designs, social innovations and green technologies can solve critical environmental challenges. The other is pessimistic in respect of technological solutions,&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 9, "[[Technological optimism|Technological Optimism]] and Belief in Progress", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; warning of impending global crisis (through [[climate change]] or [[peak oil]], for example) and tends to reject the very idea of modernity and the myth of progress that is so central to modernization thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001). ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''. Cambridge University Press, pp 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], wrote about progress as a myth benefiting the few, and a pending environmental doomsday for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.primitivism.com/facets-myth.htm |title=Five Facets of a Myth |access-date=2018-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709070151/http://www.primitivism.com/facets-myth.htm |archive-date=2009-07-09 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the philosophy of [[Deep Ecology]].

==Philosophy==
Sociologist [[Robert Nisbet]] said that "No single idea has been more important than ... the Idea of Progress in Western civilization for three thousand years",&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1980) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and defines five "crucial premises" of the idea of progress:
# value of the past
# nobility of Western civilization
# worth of economic/technological growth
# faith in reason and scientific/scholarly knowledge obtained through reason
# intrinsic importance and worth of life on earth

Sociologist [[P. A. Sorokin]] said, "The ancient Chinese, Babylonian, Hindu, Greek, Roman, and most of the medieval thinkers supporting theories of rhythmical, cyclical or trendless movements of social processes were much nearer to reality than the present proponents of the linear view".&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Sorokin, 1932 paper, quoted in Fay (1947).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Confucianism and to a certain extent Taoism, that both search for an ideal past, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition believes in the fulfillment of history, which was translated into the idea of progress in the modern age. Therefore, Chinese proponents of modernization have looked to western models. According to Thompson, the late Qing dynasty reformer, Kang Youwei, believed he had found a model for reform and "modernisation" in the Ancient Chinese Classics.&lt;ref&gt;Youwei, Kang, &amp; Lawrence G. Thompson (1958). ''Ta T'ung Shu: The One World Philosophy of Kang Yu-wei.'' London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] said that progress was not fully adequate as a scientific explanation of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Popper (1957). ''The Poverty of Historicism''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], a self-proclaimed [[neo-luddism|neo-luddite]] author, wrote exclusively about progress as a myth, in an essay entitled "Five Facets of a Myth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/facets.htm Five Facets of a Myth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iggers (1965) says that proponents of progress underestimated the extent of man's destructiveness and irrationality, while critics misunderstand the role of rationality and morality in human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Iggers (1965) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, psychoanalyst [[Charles Baudouin]] claimed modernity has retained the "corollary" of the progress myth, the idea that the present is superior to the past, while at the same time insisting that it is free of the myth:
{{quote|sign=|source=|
The last two centuries were familiar with the myth of progress. Our own century has adopted the myth of modernity. The one myth has replaced the other. ...

Men ceased to believe in progress; but only to pin their faith to more tangible realities, whose sole original significance had been that they were the instruments of progress. ..

This exaltation of the present ... is a corollary of that very faith in progress which people claim to have discarded. The present is superior to the past, by definition, only in a mythology of progress. Thus one retains the corollary while rejecting the principle. There is only one way of retaining a position of whose instability one is conscious. One must simply refrain from thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Baudouin]], ''The Myth of Modernity'', ''Le Mythe du moderne'' (1946), as translated by [[Bernard Miall]] (1950), sections 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

A cyclical theory of history was adopted by [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), a German historian who wrote ''The Decline of the West'' in 1920. [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the rise of totalitarianism demonstrated that progress was not automatic and that technological improvement did not necessarily guarantee democracy and moral advancement. British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] (1889–1975) felt that Christianity would help modern civilization overcome its challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Farrenkopf, John (1993). "Spengler's Historical Pessimism and the Tragedy of our Age," ''Theory and Society'' Vol. 22, Number 3, pp. 391–412.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeffersonians said that history is not exhausted but that man may begin again in a new world. Besides rejecting the lessons of the past, they Americanized the idea of progress by democratizing and vulgarizing it to include the welfare of the common man as a form of [[republicanism]]. As Romantics deeply concerned with the past, collecting source materials and founding historical societies, the Founding Fathers were animated by clear principles. They saw man in control of his destiny, saw virtue as a distinguishing characteristic of a republic, and were concerned with happiness, progress, and prosperity. Thomas Paine, combining the spirit of rationalism and romanticism, pictured a time when America's innocence would sound like a romance, and concluded that the fall of America could mark the end of 'the noblest work of human wisdom.'&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele (1969). [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44497969.pdf "The Past as an Extension of the Present,"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[J. B. Bury]] wrote in 1920:&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/ideaofprogressin00buryuoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Idea of Progress'']. London: Macmillan and Co., p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the minds of most people the desirable outcome of human development would be a condition of society in which all the inhabitants of the planet would enjoy a perfectly happy existence....It cannot be proved that the unknown destination towards which man is advancing is desirable. The movement may be Progress, or it may be in an undesirable direction and therefore not Progress..... The Progress of humanity belongs to the same order of ideas as Providence or personal immortality. It is true or it is false, and like them it cannot be proved either true or false. Belief in it is an act of faith.}}

In the [[postmodernist]] thought steadily gaining ground from the 1980s, the grandiose claims of the modernizers are steadily eroded, and the very concept of social progress is again questioned and scrutinized. In the new vision, radical modernizers like [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] appear as [[totalitarian]] despots, whose vision of social progress is held to be totally deformed. Postmodernists question the validity of 19th-century and 20th-century notions of progress—both on the capitalist and the Marxist side of the spectrum. They argue that both capitalism and Marxism over-emphasize technological achievements and material prosperity while ignoring the value of inner happiness and peace of mind. Postmodernism posits that both dystopia and utopia are one and the same, overarching grand narratives with impossible conclusions.

{{anchor|Myth of Progress}}{{see also|Progress trap}}
Some 20th-century authors refer to the "Myth of Progress" to refer to the idea that the human condition will inevitably improve. In 1932, English physician [[Montague David Eder]] wrote: "The myth of progress states that civilization has moved, is moving, and will move in a desirable direction. Progress is inevitable... Philosophers, men of science and politicians have accepted the idea of the inevitability of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last= David Eder | first=Montague | year=1932 | title=The Myth of Progress | journal=D. Eder. 'the Myth of Progress.' the British Journal of Medical Psychology 1932, Vol. Xii, P. 1.. Int. J. Psycho-Anal | volume=14 | pages=399 | url = http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=IJP.014.0399A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eder argues that the advancement of civilization is leading to greater unhappiness and loss of control in the environment. The strongest critics of the idea of progress complain that it remains a dominant idea in the 21st century, and shows no sign of diminished influence. As one fierce critic, British historian [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] (b. 1948), concludes:&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John (2004). "An Illusion with a Future," ''Daedalus'' Vol. 133(3), pp 10+; also Gray (2004). ''Heresies: Against Progress and Other Illusions''. Granta Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Faith in the liberating power of knowledge is encrypted into modern life. Drawing on some of Europe's most ancient traditions, and daily reinforced by the quickening advance of science, it cannot be given up by an act of will. The interaction of quickening scientific advance with unchanging human needs is a fate that we may perhaps temper, but cannot overcome... Those who hold to the possibility of progress need not fear. The illusion that through science humans can remake the world is an integral part of the modern condition. Renewing the eschatological hopes of the past, progress is an illusion with a future.}}

Recently the idea of progress has been generalized to psychology, being related with the concept of a goal, that is, progress is understood as "what counts as a means of advancing towards the end result of a given defined goal."{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

===Antiquity===

Historian [[J. B. Bury]] said that thought in [[ancient Greece]] was dominated by the theory of world-cycles or the doctrine of eternal return, and was steeped in a belief parallel to the Judaic "[[Original sin|fall of man]]," but rather from a preceding "[[Golden Age]]" of innocence and simplicity. Time was generally regarded as the enemy of humanity which depreciates the value of the world. He credits the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] with having had a potential for leading to the foundation of a theory of progress through their materialistic acceptance of the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] as the explanation for a world without an intervening [[deity]].
{{cquote|For them, the earliest condition of men resembled that of the beasts, and from this primitive and miserable condition they laboriously reached the existing state of civilisation, not by external guidance or as a consequence of some initial design, but simply by the exercise of human intelligence throughout a long period.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}}}

[[Robert Nisbet]] and [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] have attributed a notion of progress to other Greeks. [[Xenophanes]] said "The gods did not reveal to men all things in the beginning, but men through their own search find in the course of time that which is better." [[Plato]]'s Book III of ''[[The Laws]]'' depicts humanity's progress from a state of nature to the higher levels of culture, economy, and polity. Plato's ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|The Statesman]]'' also outlines a historical account of the progress of mankind.

===Renaissance===
During the Medieval period, science was to a large extent based on [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] (a method of thinking and learning from the [[Middle Ages]]) interpretations of [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] work. The Renaissance of the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries changed the mindset in Europe towards an empirical view, based on a [[pantheistic]] interpretation of [[Plato]]. This induced a revolution in curiosity about nature in general and scientific advance, which opened the gates for technical and economic advance. Furthermore, the individual potential was seen as a never-ending quest for being God-like, paving the way for a view of Man based on unlimited perfection and progress.&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, Ernst; Paul Oskar Kristeller and John Herman Randall (eds., 1948). ''The Renaissance Philosophy of Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Enlightenment (1650–1800)===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
In the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], French historian and philosopher [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) was a major proponent of progress.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} At first Voltaire's thought was informed by the idea of progress coupled with rationalism. His subsequent notion of the historical idea of progress saw science and reason as the driving forces behind societal advancement.

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) argued that progress is neither automatic nor continuous and does not measure knowledge or wealth, but is a painful and largely inadvertent passage from barbarism through civilization toward enlightened culture and the abolition of war. Kant called for education, with the education of humankind seen as a slow process whereby world history propels mankind toward peace through war, international commerce, and [[enlightened self-interest]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, Jeanne A. (1991). "Reasonable Hope: Kant as Critical Theorist," ''History of European Ideas'', '''21''' (4): 527–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish theorist [[Adam Ferguson]] (1723–1816) defined human progress as the working out of a divine plan, though he rejected predestination. The difficulties and dangers of life provided the necessary stimuli for human development, while the uniquely human ability to evaluate led to ambition and the conscious striving for excellence. But he never adequately analyzed the competitive and aggressive consequences stemming from his emphasis on ambition even though he envisioned man's lot as a perpetual striving with no earthly culmination. Man found his happiness only in effort.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, John Andrew (1978). "Adam Ferguson and the Idea of Progress," ''Studies in Burke and His Time'' '''19''' (2): 99–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider the idea of progress that was affirmed with the Enlightenment, as a [[secularization]] of ideas from early [[Christianity]], and a reworking of ideas from [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NIZfQTd3nSMC&amp;pg=PA402 The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought] By David Miller, Janet Coleman, p.402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Edelstein takes a minority view in seeing evidence for ''The Idea of Progress in Classical Antiquity'', Johns Hopkins Press (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
In the 19th century, Romantic critics charged that progress did not automatically better the human condition, and in some ways could make it worse.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Christopher John, ed. (2004). ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850''. Fitzroy Dearborn, Vol.  II, p. 912.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) reacted against the concept of progress as set forth by William Godwin and Condorcet because he believed that inequality of conditions is "the best (state) calculated to develop the energies and faculties of man". He said, "Had population and food increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might never have emerged from the savage state". He argued that man's capacity for improvement has been demonstrated by the growth of his intellect, a form of progress which offsets the distresses engendered by the law of population.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Samuel M. (1966). "Malthus and the Idea of Progress," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''27''' (1): 92–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) criticized the idea of progress as the 'weakling's doctrines of optimism,' and advocated undermining concepts such as faith in progress, to allow the strong individual to stand above the plebeian masses. An important part of his thinking consists of the attempt to use the classical model of 'eternal recurrence of the same' to dislodge the idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Tassone, Giuseppe (2002). ''A Study on the Idea of Progress in Nietzsche, Heidegger and Critical Theory''. E. Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iggers (1965) argues there was general agreement in the late 19th century that the steady accumulation of knowledge and the progressive replacement of conjectural, that is, theological or metaphysical, notions by scientific ones was what created progress. Most scholars concluded this growth of scientific knowledge and methods led to the growth of industry and the transformation of warlike societies into industrial and pacific ones. They agreed as well that there had been a systematic decline of coercion in government, and an increasing role of liberty and of rule by consent. There was more emphasis on impersonal social and historical forces; progress was increasingly seen as the result of an inner logic of society.&lt;ref&gt;Iggers, George G. (1965). "The Idea of Progress: A Critical Reassessment," ''American Historical Review'', Vol. 71, No. 1, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist theory (late 19th century)===
Marx developed a theory of [[historical materialism]]. He describes the mid-19th-century condition in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' as follows:

{{Quote|The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty, and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all which is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real condition of life and his relations with his kind.&lt;ref&gt;Manifesto of the Communist Party: Chapter 1, Marx &amp; Engels&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Furthermore, Marx described the process of social progress, which in his opinion is based on the interaction between the productive forces and the relations of production:

{{Quote|No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Preface|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm|work=Critique of political economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Capitalism]] is thought by Marx as a process of continual change, in which the growth of markets dissolve all fixities in human life, and Marx admits that capitalism is progressive and non-[[reactionary]]. [[Marxism]] further states that capitalism, in its quest for higher profits and new markets, will inevitably sow the seeds of its own destruction. Marxists believe that, in the future, capitalism will be replaced by [[socialism]] and eventually communism.

{{cquote|The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.|4=[[George Bernard Shaw]]}}

Many advocates of capitalism such as [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]] agreed with Marx's analysis of capitalism as a process of continual change through [[creative destruction]], but, unlike Marx, believed and hoped that capitalism could essentially go on forever.

Thus, by the beginning of the 20th century, two opposing schools of thought—Marxism and liberalism—believed in the possibility and the desirability of continual change and improvement. Marxists strongly opposed capitalism and the liberals strongly supported it, but the one concept they could both agree on was progress, which affirms the power of human beings to make, improve and reshape their society, with the aid of scientific knowledge, technology and practical experimentation. ''Modernity'' denotes cultures that embrace that concept of progress. (This is not the same as [[modernism]], which was the artistic and philosophical response to modernity, some of which embraced technology while rejecting individualism, but more of which rejected modernity entirely.)

[[File:Plutarchs Lives Vol the Third 1727.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Third Volume of a 1727 edition of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'' printed by [[Jacob Tonson]]]]

A '''biography''', or simply '''bio''', is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or [[curriculum vitae]] ([[résumé]]), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.

Biographical works are usually [[non-fiction]], but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life. One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing. Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the [[genre]] known as biography.

An '''authorized biography''' is written with the permission, cooperation, and at times, participation of a subject or a subject's heirs. An '''[[autobiography]]''' is written by the person himself or herself, sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or [[ghostwriter]].

== History ==
At first, biographical writings were regarded merely as a subsection of history with a focus on a particular individual of historical importance. The independent genre of biography as distinct from general history writing, began to emerge in the 18th century and reached its contemporary form at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Kendall}}

=== Historical biography&lt;!--'Historical biography' redirects here--&gt; ===
[[File:Einhard.jpg|thumb|right|Einhard as scribe]]

One of the earliest biographers was [[Cornelius Nepos]], who published his work ''Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae'' ("Lives of outstanding generals") in 44 BC. Longer and more extensive biographies were written in Greek by [[Plutarch]], in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', published about 80 A.D. In this work famous Greeks are paired with famous Romans, for example the orators [[Demosthenes]] and [[Cicero]], or the generals [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Julius Caesar]]; some fifty biographies from the work survive. Another well-known collection of ancient biographies is [[The Twelve Caesars|''De vita Caesarum'']] ("On the Lives of the Caesars") by [[Suetonius]], written about AD 121 in the time of the emperor [[Hadrian]].

In the early [[Middle Ages]] (AD 400 to 1450), there was a decline in awareness of the [[classical antiquity|classical]] culture in Europe. During this time, the only repositories of knowledge and records of the early history in Europe were those of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. [[Hermit]]s, [[monk]]s, and [[priest]]s used this historic period to write biographies. Their subjects were usually restricted to the [[Church Fathers|church father]]s, [[martyr]]s, [[pope]]s, and [[saint]]s. Their works were meant to be inspirational to the people and vehicles for [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Christianity]] (see [[Hagiography]]). One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the [[Vita Karoli Magni|life of Charlemagne]] by his courtier [[Einhard]].

In [[Islamic Golden Age|Medieval Islamic Civilization]] (c. AD 750 to 1258), similar traditional Muslim biographies of [[Muhammad]] and other important figures in the early [[history of Islam]] began to be written, beginning the [[Prophetic biography]] tradition. Early [[Biographical dictionary|biographical dictionaries]] were published as compendia of famous Islamic personalities from the 9th century onwards. They contained more social data for a large segment of the population than other works of that period. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the [[prophets of Islam]] and [[Sahaba|their companions]], with one of these early examples being ''[[The book of The Major Classes (book)|The Book of The Major Classes]]'' by [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi]]. And then began the documentation of the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.{{sfn|Nawas|2006|p=110}}

[[File:Foxe's Book of Martyrs - Frontispiece (1761).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|The Book of Martyrs]]'', was one of the earliest English-language biographies.]]
By the late Middle Ages, biographies became less church-oriented in Europe as biographies of [[monarch|king]]s, [[knight]]s, and [[tyrant]]s began to appear. The most famous of such biographies was ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' by Sir [[Thomas Malory]]. The book was an account of the life of the fabled [[King Arthur]] and his [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Following Malory, the new emphasis on [[humanism]] during the [[Renaissance]] promoted a focus on secular subjects, such as artists and poets, and encouraged writing in the vernacular.

[[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' (1550) was the landmark biography focusing on secular lives. Vasari made celebrities of his subjects, as the ''Lives'' became an early "bestseller". Two other developments are noteworthy: the development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century and the gradual increase in [[literacy]].

Biographies in the English language began appearing during the reign of [[Henry VIII]]. [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'' (1563), better known as ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs'', was essentially the first dictionary of the biography in Europe, followed by [[Thomas Fuller]]'s ''The History of the Worthies of England'' (1662), with a distinct focus on public life.

Influential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates, ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' (1724), by Charles Johnson, is the prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=?}}

A notable early collection of biographies of eminent men and women in the [[United Kingdom]] was ''[[Biographia Britannica]]'' (1747-1766) edited by [[William Oldys]].

The American biography followed the English model, incorporating [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s view that biography was a part of history. Carlyle asserted that the lives of great human beings were essential to understanding society and its institutions. While the historical impulse would remain a strong element in early American biography, American writers carved out a distinct approach. What emerged was a rather didactic form of biography, which sought to shape the individual character of a reader in the process of defining national character.{{sfn|Casper|1999|p=?}}{{sfn|Stone|1982|p=?}}{{clear}}

=== Emergence of the genre ===
[[File:James Boswell of Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|[[James Boswell]] wrote what many consider to be the first modern biography, ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', in 1791.]]

The first modern biography, and a work which exerted considerable influence on the evolution of the genre, was [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', a biography of lexicographer and man-of-letters [[Samuel Johnson]] published in 1791.{{sfn|Butler|2012}}{{unreliable source?|date=May 2020}}{{sfn|Ingram|Rawson|Waingrow|Boswell|1998|pp=319-320}}{{sfn|Turnbull|2019}}

While Boswell's personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of Johnson's life by means of additional research. Itself an important stage in the development of the modern [[genre]] of biography, it has been claimed to be the greatest biography written in the [[English language]]. Boswell's work was unique in its level of research, which involved archival study, eye-witness accounts and interviews, its robust and attractive narrative, and its honest depiction of all aspects of Johnson's life and character - a formula which serves as the basis of biographical literature to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brocklehurst |first1=Steven |date=16 May 2013 |title=James Boswell: The Man who Re-Invented Biography |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-22540020 |website=BBC News |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographical writing generally stagnated during the 19th century - in many cases there was a reversal to the more familiar [[hagiography|hagiographical]] method of eulogizing the dead, similar to the biographies of [[saint]]s produced in [[Medieval era|Medieval]] times. A distinction between mass biography and [[Biography in literature|literary biography]] began to form by the middle of the century, reflecting a breach between high culture and [[middle-class]] culture. However, the number of biographies in print experienced a rapid growth, thanks to an expanding reading public. This revolution in publishing made books available to a larger audience of readers. In addition, affordable [[paperback]] editions of popular biographies were published for the first time. [[Periodical]]s began publishing a sequence of biographical sketches.{{sfn|Casper|1999}}

[[Autobiography|Autobiographies]] became more popular, as with the rise of education and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop. Autobiographies were written by authors, such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], (his ''Autobiography'' appeared posthumously, quickly becoming a bestseller in [[London]]{{sfn|Roberts|1883|p=13}}), philosophers, such as [[John Stuart Mill]], churchmen – [[John Henry Newman]] – and entertainers – [[P. T. Barnum]].

=== Modern biography ===
The sciences of [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] were ascendant at the turn of the 20th century and would heavily influence the new century's biographies.{{sfn|Stone|1982}} The demise of the [[Great man theory|"great man"]] theory of history was indicative of the emerging mindset. Human behavior would be explained through [[Darwinian]] theories. "Sociological" biographies conceived of their subjects' actions as the result of the environment, and tended to downplay individuality. The development of [[psychoanalysis]] led to a more penetrating and comprehensive understanding of the biographical subject, and induced biographers to give more emphasis to [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]]. Clearly these psychological ideas were changing the way biographies were written, as a culture of autobiography developed, in which the telling of one's own story became a form of therapy.{{sfn|Casper|1999}} The conventional concept of heroes and narratives of success disappeared in the obsession with psychological explorations of personality.

[[File:Eminent Victorians title page.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' set the standard for 20th century biographical writing, when it was published in 1918.]]
British critic [[Lytton Strachey]] revolutionized the art of biographical writing with his 1918 work ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'', consisting of biographies of four leading figures from the [[Victorian era]]: [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Thomas Arnold]], and [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levy |first1=Paul |author-link1=Paul Levy (journalist) |date=20 July 2002 |title=A String Quartet in Four Movements |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strachey set out to breathe life into the [[Victorian era]] for future generations to read. Up until this point, as Strachey remarked in the preface, Victorian biographies had been "as familiar as the ''cortège'' of the undertaker", and wore the same air of "slow, funereal barbarism." Strachey defied the tradition of "two fat volumes{{nbsp}}... of undigested masses of material" and took aim at the four iconic figures. His narrative demolished the myths that had built up around these cherished national heroes, whom he regarded as no better than a "set of mouth bungled hypocrites". The book achieved worldwide fame due to its irreverent and witty style, its concise and factually accurate nature, and its artistic prose.{{sfn|Jones|2009}}

In the 1920s and '30s, biographical writers sought to capitalize on Strachey's popularity by imitating his style. This new school featured iconoclasts, scientific analysts, and fictional biographers and included [[Gamaliel Bradford (biographer)|Gamaliel Bradford]], [[André Maurois]], and [[Emil Ludwig]], among others. [[Robert Graves]] (''I, Claudius'', 1934) stood out among those following Strachey's model of "debunking biographies." The trend in literary biography was accompanied in popular biography by a sort of "celebrity voyeurism", in the early decades of the century. This latter form's appeal to readers was based on curiosity more than morality or patriotism. By [[World War I]], cheap hard-cover reprints had become popular. The decades of the 1920s witnessed a biographical "boom."

The feminist scholar [[Carolyn Gold Heilbrun|Carolyn Heilbrun]] observed that women's biographies and autobiographies began to change character during the second wave of [[Feminism|feminist]] activism. She cited [[Nancy Milford|Nancy Milford's]] 1970 biography ''Zelda'', as the "beginning of a new period of women's biography, because "[only] in 1970 were we ready to read not that [[Zelda Fitzgerald|Zelda]] had destroyed [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], but Fitzgerald her: he had usurped her narrative." Heilbrun named 1973 as the turning point in women's autobiography, with the publication of [[May Sarton|May Sarton's]] ''Journal of a Solitude,'' for that was the first instance where a woman told her life story, not as finding "beauty even in pain" and transforming "rage into spiritual acceptance," but acknowledging what had previously been forbidden to women: their pain, their rage, and their "open admission of the desire for power and control over one's life."{{sfn|Heilbrun|1988|pp=12, 13}}

===Recent years===
In recent years, [[multimedia]] biography has become more popular than traditional literary forms. Along with documentary [[biographical film]]s, [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] produced numerous commercial films based on the lives of famous people. The popularity of these forms of biography have led to the proliferation of TV channels dedicated to biography, including [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]], [[The Biography Channel]], and [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]].

CD-ROM and online biographies have also appeared. Unlike books and films, they often do not tell a chronological narrative: instead they are archives of many discrete media elements related to an individual person, including video clips, photographs, and text articles. Biography-Portraits were created in 2001, by the German artist [[Ralph Ueltzhoeffer]]. Media scholar [[Lev Manovich]] says that such archives exemplify the database form, allowing users to navigate the materials in many ways.{{sfn|Manovich|2001|p=220}} General "life writing" techniques are a subject of scholarly study.{{sfn|Hughes|2009|p=159}}

In recent years, debates have arisen as to whether all biographies are fiction, especially when authors are writing about figures from the past. President of Wolfson College at Oxford University, [[Hermione Lee]] argues that all history is seen through a perspective that is the product of our contemporary society and as a result  biographical truths are constantly shifting. So the history biographers write about will not be the way that it happened; it will be the way they remembered it.{{sfn|Derham|2014}} Debates have also arisen concerning the importance of space in life-writing.{{sfn|Regard|2003}}

Daniel R. Meister in 2017 argues that:
:Biography Studies is emerging as an independent discipline, especially in the Netherlands. This Dutch School of biography is moving biography studies away from the less scholarly life writing tradition and towards history by encouraging its practitioners to utilize an approach adapted from microhistory.{{sfn|Meister|2018|p=2}}

===Biographical research===
[[Biographical research]] is defined by Miller as a research method that collects and analyses a person's whole life, or portion of a life, through the in-depth and unstructured interview, or sometimes reinforced by semi-structured interview or personal documents.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=15}} It is a way of viewing social life in procedural terms, rather than static terms. The information can come from "oral history, personal narrative, biography and autobiography” or "diaries, letters, memoranda and other materials".{{sfn|Roberts|2002}} The central aim of biographical research is to produce rich descriptions of persons or "conceptualise structural types of actions", which means to "understand the action logics or how persons and structures are interlinked".{{sfn|Zinn|2004|p=3}} This method can be used to understand an individual's life within its social context or understand the cultural phenomena.

=== Critical issues ===
There are many largely unacknowledged pitfalls to writing good biographies, and these largely concern the relation between firstly the individual and the context, and, secondly, the private and public. Paul James writes:
{{cquote| The problems with such conventional biographies are manifold. Biographies usually treat the public as a reflection of the private, with the private realm being assumed to be foundational. This is strange given that biographies are most often written about public people who project a ''persona''. That is, for such subjects the dominant passages of the presentation of themselves in everyday life are already formed by what might be called a ‘self-biofication’ process.{{sfn|James|2013|p=124}}}}

Elections are held every five years unless the parliament is dissolved before that time. 

The leader of the party (or alliance of parties) holding the majority of seats becomes the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]], and the [[Head of government|head of the government]]. The [[President of Bangladesh]], the ceremonial [[head of state]], is chosen by Parliament. Since the December 2008 national election, the current [[majority]] party is the [[Awami League]]. It is led by Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]].

Koru exhibits an understanding of the topics of both queries and documents. This allows it to (a) expand queries automatically and (b) help guide the user as they evolve their queries interactively. Its understanding is mined from the vast investment of manual effort and judgment that is Wikipedia. We show how this open, constantly evolving encyclopedia can yield inexpensive knowledge structures that are specifically tailored to expose the topics, terminology and semantics of individual document collections. We conducted a detailed user study with 12 participants and 10 topics from the 2005 TREC HARD track, and found that Koru and its underlying knowledge base offers significant advantages over traditional keyword search. It was capable of lending assistance to almost every query issued to it; making their entry more efficient, improving the relevance of the documents they return, and narrowing the gap between expert and novice seekers..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milne|first=David N.|last2=Witten|first2=Ian H.|last3=Nichols|first3=David M.|date=2007|title=A knowledge-based search engine powered by wikipedia|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1321440.1321504|journal=Proceedings of the Sixteenth ACM Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management - CIKM '07|language=en|location=Lisbon, Portugal|publisher=ACM Press|pages=445–454|doi=10.1145/1321440.1321504|citeseerx=10.1.1.148.2362|isbn=978-1-59593-803-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{category explanation|'''fields of history''' in reference to the categories professional historians use to classify their broad areas of work within the overall [[academic discipline]] of [[history]]. Some of these categories (e.g. cultural history, social history, intellectual history) refer to historical method rather than specific topic of study, while others coincide or partially overlap with the practical classification of [[:Category:History by topic|history by topic]]. Articles in these categories should be about the disciplinary fields themselves (e.g. [[Art history]] or [[Women's history]]), NOT the subject matter of those fields (e.g. [[History of art]] or [[:Category:Women in history|Women in history]])}}

'''Scilla''' ({{lang-scn|label=[[Central-Southern Calabrian|Calabrian]]|U Scigghiu}}; {{Lang-el|Σκύλλα|Skýlla}}) is a town and ''[[comune]]'' in [[Calabria]], [[Italy]], administratively part of the [[Metropolitan City  of Reggio Calabria]].  It is the traditional site of the sea monster [[Scylla]] of [[Greek mythology]].

==Description==
The town, {{convert|22|km|mi}} from the city of [[Reggio di Calabria|Reggio]], lies in front of the [[strait of Messina]], and is composed of two parts: the downtown, where the town offices and the residence of the patron saint are situated, and ''[[Marina di Scilla]]'', the beach-front, populated by tourists and thus heavily characterized by hotels and restaurants.
Its beach is the first place north of Reggio Calabria where the waters are not cooled by the strait draughts.

Scilla's coastal district of Chianalea is included in the ''[[I Borghi più belli d'Italia]]'' association of small Italian towns of historical interest list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://borghipiubelliditalia.it/project/chianalea/ |title = Chianalea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ruffo Castle, a fortress  built by the [[Dukes of Calabria]], overlooks the beach. On a seaward-facing terrace is [[Scilla Lighthouse]], an important aid to ships entering the [[Strait of Messina]] from the north.

==History==
It is said that Tyrrhenian pirates were the first to settle this coastal area in 493 BC, but others claim it was already settled during the time of the Trojan Wars in the 12th century BC.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Castles of Italy: Castello Ruffo di Scilla, Calabria|url=http://www.grandvoyageitaly.com/10/post/2018/06/castles-of-italy-castello-ruffo-di-scilla-calabria.html|website=GRAND VOYAGE ITALY|language=en|access-date=2020-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Scilla has ancient origins that relate mainly to the period of the destruction of Troy and invokes the myths and legends of Ulysses with Scylla and [[Charybdis]], of [[Homer]] and Dante Alighieri.
The town’s name derives from the mythological figure of [[Scylla]], a young nymph who refused Glauco’s love. He thus went to the sorceress Circe, who was in love with him, and asked her to help him win Scylla’s heart. The offended sorceress poisoned the sea-pool where the nymph used to bathe, turning her into a horrific six dog-headed monster who destroyed every ship crossing the [[Strait of Messina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turiscalabria.it/website/?lang=en&amp;categoria=/where/parco-nazionale-aspromonte/&amp;view_type=s&amp;id=181&amp;title=the-beauty-and-myth-of-the-terrible-scylla.html&lt;/ref&gt; Scylla is said to live in the rock of Scilla in which the Castello di Ruffo sits on.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The village suffered greatly from the [[1783 Calabria earthquakes]] and the [[1908 Messina earthquake]].

==Geography==
The municipality of Scilla includes the [[Frazione|subdivisions]] Favazzina, Melia, and Solano Superiore.

Scilla borders the municipalities of [[Bagnara Calabra]] and [[Villa San Giovanni]].

Scilla lays across the [[Strait of Messina]], with [[Sicily]] observable from the town. When visibility is clear, the island of [[Stromboli]] can also be seen.

==Twin towns==
Scilla has been twinned with the following:
* [[Ħamrun]], Malta

==In popular culture==
Scilla is one of two primary settings in ''[[Elizabeth Street (Manhattan)|Elizabeth Street]]'', a 2009 historical novel by Laurie Fabiano that tells of the experiences of a family who emigrates from Scilla to [[New York City]]'s [[Little Italy]] neighborhood in the early [[20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fabiano |first=Laurie |title=Elizabeth Street |publisher=[[CreateSpace]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-1442152618 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1gdgtwAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the author's family history, it includes a detailed description of the 1908 [[earthquake]] and [[tsunami]].

==Transport==
The town is served by a station on the [[Salerno]]-[[Reggio Calabria]] railway.

Main roads include the [[Autostrada A2 (Italy)|A2 Salerno-Reggio motorway]] and the [[Strada statale 18 Tirrena Inferiore]].

'''al-Baranis''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: البرانس, ''Al-Barānis''), spelled sometimes as '''Barnès''' or '''Branes''', are according to [[Ibn Khaldun]] one of the the two original groups of [[Berbers]], the other being called al-Butr. Despite being mentioned by medieval Arabic chroniclers, awareness about this ancestral identity has gradually vanished over the ages and is not not very well known or shared among contemporary Berbers. The Barānis are, according to Ibn Khaldun, further divided into following main groups: Awraba, ʿAd̲j̲īsa, Azdād̲j̲a, [[Masmuda|Maṣmūda]]-[[Ghomaras|G̲h̲umāra]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colin|first=G. S.|date=2012-04-24|title=al-Barānis|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-baranis-SIM_1219|journal=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Belonging of another three groups, such as [[Kutama|Kutāma]]-Zawāwa, [[Sanhaja|Ṣanhāja]], [[Houara|Hawwāra]] is controversial&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The name Barānis is a plural form of their eponymous forefather, Burnus, who is described as son of [[Māzīgh b. Can‘ān]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ben Hassine|first=Boutheina|date=2015|title=L’Image des Berbères dans les sources Ibadites|url=|journal=Géographie historique du Maghreb Antique et Médiéval: État des lieux et perspectives de recherches|volume=|pages=295|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a legendary Berber ancestor. The place of origin of the Baranis is unknown, the first area, where the groups of Baranis are historically located, is the massif of [[Aurès|Awrās]] in today’s Eastern [[Algeria]], from where they started to migrate across North Africa at the time of [[Arab conquest of North Africa|Arab conquest]] in the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Ibn Khaldun considered the Baranis as sedentary people and the ancestors of sedentary Berbers, while the other group, the Butr, were considered the ancestors of nomadic Berbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ilahiane, Hsain, author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/966314885|title=Historical dictionary of the Berbers (Imazighen)|isbn=978-1-4422-8182-0|oclc=966314885}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History of Bananis' sub-groups ==
The Awraba migrated from Awrās to northern parts of today’s [[Morocco]], where they supported the foundation of Idrisid rule. The Maṣmūda-G̲h̲umāra went the same direction, where the former settled in the [[High Atlas]] and later became founders of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] movement and a powerful empire, while the latter subgroup settled in the [[Rif]] mountains, where they live to these days&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yver|first=G.|date=2012-04-24|title=G̲h̲umāra|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ghumara-SIM_2518|journal=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Azdād̲j̲a have settled north of [[Tlemcen]] in today’s western Algeria and their chiefs controlled the area around the port of Wahran/[[Oran]] before the city was founded in the early 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schreier, Joshua, 1969- author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1054395205|title=The merchants of Oran : a Jewish port at the dawn of empire|isbn=978-1-5036-0216-8|oclc=1054395205}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[Sanhaja|Ṣanhāja]] were a large group, the sedentary part of them is later known to live in the area of today's north-eastern Algeria. From among them came the [[Zirid dynasty]], which ruled as governors of [[Ifriqiya|Ifrikiya]] for [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid caliphs]], after the Fatimids moved their capital to Egypt. Another well-known dynasty of this branch of the Sanhaja were the Hammadids, who established their power as Zirid emirs, first in 987 in Ashir, and from 1007/1008 around [[Qalaat Beni Hammad]]. 

The Kutāma also lived in north-eastern Algeria and were the principal pillar of Fatimid military power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lev|first=Yaacov|date=August 1987|title=Army, Regime, And Society In Fatimid Egypt, 358–487/968–1094|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0020743800056762|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=19|issue=3|pages=337–366|doi=10.1017/s0020743800056762|issn=0020-7438}}&lt;/ref&gt;, especially in the begginings of their caliphate.

During medieval period the awareness or claims of Baranis ancestry diminished and were overlayere.

'''Religious philosophy''' is philosophical thinking that is inspired and directed by a particular religion. It can be done objectively, but may also be done as a persuasion tool by believers in that faith. It is particularly interested in the nature and existence of God, or gods, or the divine.

It is sometimes distinguished from [[philosophy of religion]], a branch of [[philosophy]] that is concerned with the philosophical study ''of'' religion. Philosophy of religion is the thinking ''about'' religion which critically examines the religions of the world, their justifications, meanings, social purposes, and claims, which can be carried out dispassionately by a believer and non-believer alike.
 
Concepts specifically concerning the existence and nature of [[God]] are listed under [[:Category:Theology]].

"Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved." (p. 666).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==

=== Knowledge ===
Initially, the term 'philosophy' referred to any body of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education, and politics. Though as of the 2000s it has been classified as a book of physics, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]'' (1687) uses the term [[natural philosophy|''natural philosophy'']] as it was understood at the time to encompass disciplines, such as [[astronomy]], [[medicine]] and [[physics]], that later became associated with sciences.{{sfn|Lindberg|2007|p=3}}

In the first part of his ''Academica'' 1, [[Cicero]] introduced the division of philosophy into logic, physics, and ethics, emulating [[Epicurus]]' division of his doctrine into canon, physics, and ethics. 

In section thirteen of his [[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|''Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers'']] 1, [[Diogenes Laërtius]] (3rd century), the first historian of philosophy, established the traditional division of philosophical inquiry into three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YASbAEhCLw0C}}|title=Kant: Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107401068|edition=2nd|quote=Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three branches of knowledge: natural science, ethics, and logic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Science|Natural philosophy]] (i.e. physics, from {{Lang-el|ta physika|lit=things having to do with ''physis'' [nature]|italic=yes}}) was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world;
*[[Ethics|Moral philosophy]] (i.e. ethics, from {{Lang-el|êthika|lit=having to do with character, disposition, manners|italic=yes|label=none}}) was the study of goodness, right and wrong, justice and virtue; and 
*[[Metaphysics|Metaphysical philosophy]] (i.e. logic, from {{Lang-el|logikós|lit=of or pertaining to reason or speech|italic=yes|label=none}}) was the study of [[existence]], causation, [[God]], [[logic]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|forms]], and other abstract objects ({{Lang-el|meta ta physika|lit=after the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''|italic=yes|label=none}}).

This division is not obsolete but has changed: ''natural philosophy'' has split into the various natural sciences, especially physics, [[astronomy]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[cosmology]]; ''moral philosophy'' has birthed the [[Social science|social sciences]], while still including [[value theory]] (e.g. ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[political philosophy]], etc.); and ''metaphysical philosophy'' has given way to formal sciences such as logic, [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science]], while still including epistemology, cosmology, etc.

=== Philosophical progress ===
Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today. [[Colin McGinn|McGinn]] (1993) and others claim that no [[philosophical progress]] has occurred during that interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Inquiry|last=McGinn|first=Colin|date=1993|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=o_xMMPWzIecC}}|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-55786-475-8|edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]] (2013) and others, by contrast, see progress in philosophy similar to that in science,&lt;ref&gt;[[David Chalmers|Chalmers, David]]. 7 May 2013. "[https://www.sms.cam.ac.uk/media/1484158 Why isn't there more progress in philosophy?]" [video lecture]. [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club|''Moral Sciences Club'']]. Faculty of Philosophy, [[University of Cambridge]]. Retrieved 8 May 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; while Brewer (2011) argued that "progress" is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brewer|first=Talbot|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=d15rGnw_6rUC}}|title=The Retrieval of Ethics|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-969222-4|edition=1st|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical overview&lt;!--'History of philosophy' redirects here--&gt; ==
{{anchor|History}}
In one general sense, philosophy is associated with [[wisdom]], intellectual culture, and a search for knowledge. In this sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions, such as "how are we to live" and "what is the nature of reality." A broad and impartial conception of philosophy, then, finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as [[reality]], [[morality]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;m and life in all world civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy|chapter=Introduction|editor1-last=Garfield|editor1-first= Jay L|editor2-last=Edelglass|editor2-first=William|date=2011-06-09|isbn=9780195328998|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|chapter-url=https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195328998.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195328998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Western philosophy]] is the philosophical tradition of the [[Western world]], dating back to [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] thinkers who were active in 6th-century [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] (BCE), such as [[Thales]] ({{Circa|624|lk=yes}} – 546 BCE) and [[Pythagoras]] ({{Circa|570|lk=no}} – 495 BCE) who practiced a 'love of wisdom' ({{Lang-la|philosophia}})&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=b_VvghYDArwC}}|title=Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Greek philosophy|last=Hegel|first=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich|last2=Brown|first2=Robert F.|date=2006|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-927906-7|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were also termed 'students of nature' ({{Lang-la|physiologoi|label=none}}). 

[[Socrates]] was a very influential philosopher, who insisted that he possessed no ''wisdom'', but rather, he was a ''pursuer of'' wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DSym.%3Asection%3D201d|title=Plato's "Symposium"|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|page=201d and following|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western philosophy]] can be divided into three eras: 

# [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient]] ([[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]]); 
# [[Medieval philosophy]] (Christian European); and 
# [[Modern philosophy]].

==== Ancient era ====
The ancient era was dominated by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophical schools]] which arose out of the various pupils of Socrates, such as [[Plato]], who founded the [[Platonic Academy]] and his student [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="process"/&gt; founding the [[Peripatetic school]], who were both extremely influential in Western tradition. Other traditions include [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], [[Stoicism]], [[Philosophical skepticism|Skepticism]] and [[Epicureanism]]. Important topics covered by the Greeks included [[metaphysics]] (with competing theories such as [[atomism]] and [[monism]]), [[cosmology]], the nature of the well-lived life (''[[eudaimonia]]''), the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason ([[logos]]). With the rise of the [[Roman empire]], Greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in [[Latin]] by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] such as [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (see [[Roman philosophy]]).

==== Medieval era ====
[[Medieval philosophy]] (5th–16th centuries) is the period following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and was dominated by the rise of [[Christianity]] and hence reflects [[Judeo-Christian]] theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of [[God]], the nature of [[faith]] and reason, metaphysics, the [[problem of evil]] were discussed in this period. Some key Medieval thinkers include [[St. Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] and [[Roger Bacon]]. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to [[Theology]] ({{Lang-la|ancilla theologiae|label=none}}) and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of [[Scholasticism]], a text critical method developed in [[medieval universities]] based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The [[Renaissance]] period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust [[Humanism]].

==== Modern era ====
[[Early modern philosophy]] in the Western world begins with thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650).&lt;ref name="diane"&gt;{{cite book|author=Collinson, Diane|first=|title=Fifty Major Philosophers, A Reference Guide|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=125|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rise of natural science, [[modern philosophy]] was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;ref name="philosophical12" group="lower-roman"&gt;[[Donald Rutherford (philosopher)|Rutherford, Donald]]. 2006. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lH8FAQAAIAAJ The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy]''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-521-82242-8}}.

"Most often this [period] has been associated with the achievements of a handful of great thinkers: the so-called 'rationalists' ([[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) and 'empiricists' ([[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]]), whose inquiries culminate in Kant's 'Critical philosophy.' These canonical figures have been celebrated for the depth and rigor of their treatments of perennial philosophical questions…" (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="traditional" group="lower-roman"&gt;[[Steven Nadler|Nadler, Steven]]. 2008. ''A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy''. [[Wiley (publisher)|John Wiley &amp; Sons]]. {{ISBN|978-0-470-99883-0}}.

"The study of early modern philosophy demands that we pay attention to a wide variety of questions and an expansive pantheon of thinkers: the traditional canonical figures (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), to be sure, but also a large 'supporting cast'…" (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philosophical13" group="lower-roman"&gt;[[Bruce Kuklick|Kuklick, Bruce]]. 1984.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

"Literary, philosophical, and historical studies often rely on a notion of what is ''canonical''. In American philosophy scholars go from [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] to [[John Dewey]]; in American literature from [[James Fenimore Cooper]] to [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]; in political theory from Plato to Hobbes and Locke.… The texts or authors who fill in the blanks from A to Z in these, and other intellectual traditions, constitute the canon, and there is an accompanying narrative that links text to text or author to author, a 'history of' American literature, economic thought, and so on. The most conventional of such histories are embodied in university courses and the textbooks that accompany them. This essay examines one such course, the History of Modern Philosophy, and the texts that helped to create it. If a philosopher in the United States were asked why the seven people in my title comprise Modern Philosophy, the initial response would be: they were the best, and there are historical and philosophical connections among them." (p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[19th-century philosophy]] ([[late modern philosophy]]) is influenced by the wider movement termed [[the Enlightenment]], and includes figures such as [[Hegel]] a key figure in [[German idealism]], [[Kierkegaard]] who developed the foundations for [[existentialism]], [[Nietzsche]] a famed anti-Christian, [[John Stuart Mill]] who promoted [[utilitarianism]], [[Karl Marx]] who developed the foundations for [[communism]] and the American [[William James]]. The 20th century saw the split between [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]], as well as philosophical trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], [[logical positivism]], [[pragmatism]] and the [[linguistic turn]] (see [[Contemporary philosophy]]).

The regions of the [[fertile Crescent]], [[Iran]] and [[Arabia]] are home to the earliest known philosophical [[Wisdom literature]] and is today mostly dominated by [[Islamic culture]]. Early wisdom literature from the fertile crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action, practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs. In [[Ancient Egypt]], these texts were known as [[sebayt|''sebayt'']] ('teachings') and they are central to our understandings of [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy]]. [[Babylonian astronomy]] also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks. [[Jewish philosophy]] and [[Christian philosophy]] are religio-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, which both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the [[Tanakh]]) and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as the [[Geonim]] of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]] and [[Maimonides]] engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] who ushered in the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish Enlightenment), [[Jewish existentialism]], and [[Reform Judaism]].

Pre-Islamic [[Iranian philosophy]] begins with the work of [[Zoroaster]], one of the first promoters of [[monotheism]] and of the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] between good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as [[Manichaeism]], [[Mazdakism]], and [[Zurvanism]].

After the [[Muslim conquests]], [[Early Islamic philosophy]] developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions. This [[Islamic Golden Age]] influenced European intellectual developments. The two main currents of early Islamic thought are [[Kalam]] which focuses on [[Islamic theology]] and [[#Falsafa|Falsafa]] which was based on [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. The work of Aristotle was very influential among the falsafa such as [[al-Kindi]] (9th century), [[Avicenna]] (980 – June 1037) and [[Averroes]] (12th century). Others such as [[Al-Ghazali]] were highly critical of the methods of the Aristotelian falsafa. Islamic thinkers also developed a [[scientific method]], experimental medicine, a theory of optics and a legal philosophy. [[Ibn Khaldun]] was an influential thinker in [[philosophy of history]].

In [[History of Iran|Iran]], several schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age and include currents such as [[Illuminationist philosophy]], [[Sufi philosophy]], and [[Transcendent theosophy]]. The 19th- and 20th-century [[Arab world]] saw the ''[[Nahda]]'' ('awakening'; aka the 'Arab Renaissance') movement which influenced [[contemporary Islamic philosophy]].

"Whatever the source of the generally accepted classification of Indian philosophical systems, its six divisions do not appear to most scholars in this field to stem from logic. As a systematic attempt to deal with theoretical problems of metaphysics, logic, epistemology, and related topics, the “six systems” account has several glaring deficiencies. Two of these will be mentioned briefly.… A second deficiency in the “six-system” account is that it only covers orthodox philosophers, i.e., the Hindu schools of thought. From a philosophical standpoint, the views of the Buddhists and Jains are equally important."&lt;/ref&gt; Other schools include the [[Ajñana]], [[Ājīvika]], and [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]] which became extinct over their history.&lt;ref name="andrewoverview"&gt;Nicholson, Andrew. 2013.

Jain philosophy accepts the concept of a permanent soul ([[Jiva|''jiva'']]) as one of the five ''[[Āstika and nāstika|astikayas]]'' (eternal, infinite categories that make up the substance of existence).

====Buddhist philosophy====
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy}}
[[File:Monks debating at Sera monastery, 2013.webm|thumb|Monks debating at [[Sera monastery]], Tibet, 2013. According to Jan Westerhoff, "public debates constituted the most important and most visible forms of philosophical exchange" in ancient Indian intellectual life.&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 2018, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of [[Gautama Buddha]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] between 6th and 4th century BCE) and is preserved in the [[Early Buddhist Texts|early Buddhist texts]]. It originated in India and later spread to [[East Asia]], [[Tibet]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]], developing various traditions in these regions. [[Mahayana]] forms are the dominant Buddhist philosophical traditions in East Asian regions such as [[China]], [[South Korea|Korea]] and [[Japan]]. The [[Theravada]] forms are dominant in [[Southeast Asia]]n countries, such as [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]].

Because [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]] to the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering (''[[dukkha]]''), Buddhist philosophy is concerned with epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychology. Buddhist philosophical texts must also be understood within the context of [[Buddhist meditation|meditative practices]] which are supposed to bring about certain cognitive shifts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Jan Westerhoff|Westerhoff, Jan]]. 2018. ''The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|8}} Key innovative concepts include the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] as an analysis of ''dukkha'', [[Impermanence|''anicca'']] (impermanence), and [[anatta|''anatta'']] (non-self).&lt;ref group="lower-roman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gombrich, Richard|first=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|title=Theravada Buddhism|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|location=|page=|pages=}}

"All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence." (p. 47).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Buswell Jr., Robert E., and Donald S.

After the death of the Buddha, various groups began to systematize his main teachings, eventually developing comprehensive philosophical systems termed ''[[Abhidharma]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|37}} Following the Abhidharma schools, [[Mahayana]] philosophers such as [[Nagarjuna]] and [[Vasubandhu]] developed the theories of [[Śūnyatā|''śūnyatā'']] ('emptiness of all phenomena') and [[Yogachara#Vijñapti-mātra|''vijñapti-matra'']] ('appearance only'), a form of phenomenology or [[transcendental idealism]]. The [[Dignāga]] school of ''[[Pramana|pramāṇa]]'' ('means of knowledge') promoted a sophisticated form of [[Buddhist logico-epistemology]].

There were numerous schools, sub-schools and traditions of Buddhist philosophy in India. According to Oxford professor of Buddhist philosophy [[Jan Westerhoff]], the major Indian schools from 300 BCE to 1000 CE were:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|xxiv}}

* The [[Mahāsāṃghika]] tradition.
* The [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthavira]] schools which include: [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]], [[Sautrāntika]], [[Vibhajyavāda]] (later known as [[Theravada]] in [[Sri Lanka]]), and [[Pudgalavada|Pudgalavāda]]. 
* The [[Mahayana]] schools, mainly the [[Madhyamaka]], [[Yogachara]], [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras|Tathāgatagarbha]] and [[Vajrayana|Tantra]].

After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, some of these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]], [[East Asian Buddhist]] and [[Theravada Buddhist]] traditions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The Vedas-based orthodox schools are a part of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] traditions and they are traditionally classified into six ''[[Hindu philosophy|darśanas]]'': [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]], and [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref name="Craig2013p353" group="lower-roman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig|first=Edward|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G05h3H0Zq7cC|title=Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-59391-0|location=|pages=}}

"Hindu philosophy is the longest surviving philosophical tradition in India.… It is customary to name six Hindu schools, of the more than a dozen that existed, thus lumping several into a single school. This is particularly the case with Vedanta. The six are listed in three pairs: [[Samkhya|Samkhya-Yoga]], [[Vedanta]]-[[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]], [[Nyaya]]-[[Vaisheshika]]."

"The attitude towards the existence of God varies within the Hindu religious tradition. This may not be entirely unexpected given the tolerance for doctrinal diversity for which the tradition is known. Thus of the six orthodox systems of Hindu philosophy, only three address the question in some detail. These are the schools of thought known as Nyaya, Yoga and the theistic forms of Vedanta." (pp. 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest surviving Hindu mystical and philosophical texts are the [[Upanishads]] of the [[Vedic period#Later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)|later Vedic period]] (1000–500 BCE). Hindu philosophers of the six schools developed systems of epistemology ([[pramana|''pramana'']]) and investigated topics such as metaphysics, ethics, psychology ([[Guṇa|''guṇa'']]), [[hermeneutics]], and [[soteriology]] within the framework of the Vedic knowledge, while presenting a diverse collection of interpretations.&lt;ref name="frazierintrop2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Jessica|title=The Continuum companion to Hindu studies | date=2011|publisher=Continuum| location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-9966-0|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Carl. 2007.

"The denial that a human being possesses a "self" or "soul" is probably the most famous Buddhist teaching. It is certainly its most distinct, as has been pointed out by [[Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|G.P. Malalasekera]]: 'In its denial of any real permanent Soul or Self, Buddhism stands alone.' A similar modern Sinhalese perspective has been expressed by [[Walpola Rahula Thero|Walpola Rahula]]: 'Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a Soul, Self or Ātman.' The 'no Self' or 'no soul' doctrine ({{Lang-sa|anātman}}; {{Lang-pi|anattan}}) is particularly notable for its widespread acceptance and historical endurance. It was a standard belief of virtually all the ancient schools of Indian Buddhism (the notable exception being the Pudgalavādins), and has persisted without change into the modern era.… [B]oth views are mirrored by the modern Theravādin perspective of [[Mahasi Sayadaw]] that 'there is no person or soul' and the modern Mahāyāna view of the fourteenth Dalai Lama that '[t]he Buddha taught that…our belief in an independent self is the root cause of all suffering.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[K.

East Asian philosophical thought began in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] begins during the [[Western Zhou]] Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" flourished (6th century to 221 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay L., and William Edelglass, eds. 2011. "Chinese Philosophy." ''The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|9780195328998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=42|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Daoism]] as well as numerous other less influential schools. These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such [[Tao]], [[Yin and yang]], [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]] and [[Li (Confucianism)|Li]] which, along with [[Chinese Buddhism]], directly influenced [[Korean philosophy]], [[Vietnamese philosophy]] and [[Japanese philosophy]] (which also includes the native [[Shinto]] tradition). Buddhism began arriving in China during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE), through a [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|gradual Silk road transmission]] and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/[[Zen]]) which spread throughout the [[East Asian cultural sphere]]. During later Chinese dynasties like the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1897) a resurgent [[Neo-Confucianism]] led by thinkers such as [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state.

In the Modern era, Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophy. [[Chinese Marxist philosophy]] developed under the influence of [[Mao Zedong]], while a Chinese pragmatism under [[Hu Shih]] and [[New Confucianism]]'s rise was influenced by [[Xiong Shili]]. Modern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences ([[Rangaku]]) and the modernist [[Meirokusha]] intellectual society which drew from European enlightenment thought. The 20th century saw the rise of [[State Shinto]] and also [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese nationalism]]. The [[Kyoto School]], an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school developed from Western [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of [[Dogen]].

===African philosophy===
{{Main|African philosophy}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Frantz Fanon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Frantz Fanon]].]] --&gt;
African philosophy is philosophy produced by [[African people]], philosophy that presents African worldviews, ideas and themes, or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods. Modern African thought has been occupied with [[Ethnophilosophy]], with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be [[African people|African]].&lt;ref&gt;Janz, Bruce B. 2009.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0739136682 Philosophy in an African Place]''. Plymouth, UK: [[Lexington Books]]. pp. 74–79.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, [[Ethiopian philosophy]] developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]]. Another early African philosopher was [[Anton Wilhelm Amo]] (c. 1703–1759) who became a respected philosopher in Germany. Distinct African philosophical ideas include [[Ujamaa]], the [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu]] idea of [[Bantu Philosophy|'Force']], [[Négritude]], [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]]. Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of [[Africana philosophy]], the philosophical literature of the [[African diaspora]] which includes currents such as [[black existentialism]] by [[African-Americans]]. Some modern African thinkers have been influenced by [[Marxism]], [[African-American literature]], [[Critical theory]], [[Critical race theory]], [[Postcolonialism]] and [[African feminism|Feminism]].

===Indigenous American philosophy===
{{Main|Indigenous American philosophy}}
[[File:Tlamatini observe stars - Codex Mendoza.jpg|thumb|A [[Tlamatini]] (Aztec philosopher) observing the stars, from the [[Codex Mendoza]].]]
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous-American]] philosophical thought consists of a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among different American cultures. Among some of [[Native Americans in the United States|U.S. Native American]] communities, there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the '[[Great Spirit]]'  ([[Siouan languages|Siouan]]: ''[[Wakan Tanka|wakȟáŋ tȟáŋka]]''; [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]: [[Gitche Manitou|''gitche manitou'']]). Another widely shared concept was that of [[Orenda|''orenda'']] ('spiritual power'). According to Whiteley (1998), for the Native Americans, "mind is critically informed by transcendental experience (dreams, visions and so on) as well as by reason."&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"&gt;Whiteley, Peter M. 1998. "[https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/native-american-philosophy/v-1 Native American philosophy]." ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].'' [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].  {{Doi|10.4324/9780415249126-N078-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed [[Shamanism|''shamanism'']]. Another feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants.&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierotti, Raymond. 2003. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160404090034/http://www.se.edu/nas/files/2013/03/5thNAScommunities.pdf Communities as both Ecological and Social entities in Native American thought]."

Archived from the [http://www.se.edu/nas/files/2013/03/5thNAScommunities.pdf original] 4 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mesoamerica]], [[Aztec philosophy]] was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called ''[[Tlamatini]]'' ('those who know something')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OI9J7R-R1awC&amp;q=120#v=onepage&amp;q=Tlamatini&amp;f=false |title=Use of "Tlamatini" in ''Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind – Miguel León Portilla'' |accessdate=December 12, 2014|isbn=9780806122953 |last1=Portilla |first1=Miguel León |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its ideas are preserved in various [[Aztec codices]]. The Aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called ''[[Ōmeteōtl]]'' ('Dual Cosmic Energy') which sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing, "slippery" world. 

The theory of ''[[Teotl]]'' can be seen as a form of [[Pantheism]].&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;IEP, Aztec Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/&lt;/ref&gt; Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aesthetics. Aztec ethics was focused on seeking ''tlamatiliztli'' ('knowledge', 'wisdom') which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the [[Nahuas|Nahua]] proverb "the middle good is necessary."&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu" /&gt;

The [[Inca civilization]] also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the ''Amawtakuna'' who were important in the [[Inca education]] system as teachers of religion, tradition, history and ethics. Key concepts of Andean thought are [[Yanantin]] and [[Yanantin#Masintin|Masintin]] which involve a theory of “complementary opposites” that sees polarities (such as male/female, dark/light) as interdependent parts of a harmonious whole.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Hillary S. 2012. ''Yanantin and Masintin in the Andean World: Complementary Dualism in Modern Peru''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Branches}} Categories ==
Philosophical questions can be grouped into categories. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. The groupings also make philosophy easier for students to approach. Students can learn the basic principles involved in one aspect of the field without being overwhelmed with the entire set of philosophical theories.

Various sources present different categorical schemes. The categories adopted in this article aim for breadth and simplicity.

These five major branches can be separated into sub-branches and each sub-branch contains many specific fields of study:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consc.net/taxonomy.html|title=A Taxonomy of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]
* [[Value theory]]
* Science, [[logic]], and mathematics
* History of Western philosophy{{sfn|Kenny|2012}}
* Philosophical traditions

These divisions are neither exhaustive, nor mutually exclusive. (A philosopher might specialize in [[Kant]]ian epistemology, or [[Plato]]nic aesthetics, or modern political philosophy). Furthermore, these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science, religion or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/religion-science/|title=Religion and Science|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|date=2014|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition= Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysics ===
{{Main|Metaphysics}}

Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of [[reality]], such as [[existence]], [[time]], [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and their [[Property (philosophy)|properties]], wholes and their parts, events, processes and [[Causality|causation]] and the relationship between [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]]. Metaphysics includes [[cosmology]], the study of the [[world]] in its entirety and [[ontology]], the study of [[being]].

A major point of debate is between [[Philosophical realism|realism]], which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and [[idealism]], which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial. Metaphysics deals with the topic of [[Personal identity|identity]]. [[Essence]] is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]] is a property that the object has, without which the object can still retain its identity. [[Particular]]s are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to [[abstract object]]s, such as numbers, and [[universals]], which are properties held by multiple particulars, such as redness or a gender. The type of existence, if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate.

=== Epistemology ===
{{Main|Epistemology}}
[[File:Dignaga.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Dignaga]] founded a school of [[Buddhist logic|Buddhist epistemology and logic]].]]
Epistemology is the study of knowledge ({{Lang-grc-gre|episteme|italic=yes}}).&lt;ref name="WebsterRUD"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = G &amp; C. Merriam Co. |author1-link = Merriam-Webster |title = Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |edition = 1913 |editor = Noah Porter |publisher = G &amp; C. Merriam Co. |year = 1913 |page = 501 |url = http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=epistemology&amp;use1913=on |accessdate = 13 May 2012 |quote = E*pis`te*mol"o*gy (?), n. [Gr. knowledge + -logy.] The theory or science of the method or grounds of knowledge. |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131015165808/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=epistemology&amp;use1913=on |archivedate = 15 October 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epistemologists study the putative sources of knowledge, including intuition, a priori reason, memory, perceptual knowledge, self-knowledge and testimony. They also ask: What is [[truth]]? Is knowledge justified true belief? Are any beliefs [[Theory of justification|justified]]? Putative knowledge includes propositional knowledge (knowledge that something is the case), know-how (knowledge of how to do something) and acquaintance (familiarity with someone or something). Epistemologists examine these and ask whether knowledge is really possible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

[[Philosophical skepticism|Skepticism]] is the position which doubts claims to knowledge. The [[regress argument]], a fundamental problem in epistemology, occurs when, in order to completely prove any statement, its justification itself needs to be supported by another justification. This chain can go on forever, called [[infinitism]], it can eventually rely on [[basic beliefs]] that are left unproven, called [[foundationalism]], or it can go in a circle so that a statement is included in its own chain of justification, called [[coherentism]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

[[Rationalism]] is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge. It is associated with [[a priori knowledge]], which is independent of experience, such as math and logical deduction. [[Empiricism]] is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Among the numerous topics within metaphysics and epistemology, broadly construed, are:{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

* [[Philosophy of language]]: explores the nature, the origins and the use of language;
* [[Philosophy of mind]]: explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body. It is typified by disputes between [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[materialism]]. In recent years this branch has become related to [[cognitive science]];
* [[Human nature|Philosophy of human nature]]: analyzes the unique characteristics of human beings, such as rationality, politics and culture; and
* [[Metaphilosophy]]: explores the aims of philosophy, its boundaries and its methods.

=== Value theory ===
Value theory (or [[axiology]]) is the major branch of philosophy that addresses topics such as goodness, beauty and justice. Value theory includes ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, feminist philosophy, philosophy of law and more.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==== Ethics ====
{{Main|Ethics}}
[[File:BeijingConfuciusTemple9.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|The [[Beijing]] [[Guozijian (Beijing)|imperial college]] was an intellectual center for Confucian ethics and classics during the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties.]]
Ethics, or 'moral philosophy', studies and considers what is good and bad [[Action (philosophy)|conduct]], right and [[wrong]] [[values (philosophy)|values]], and [[good and evil]]. Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of [[morality]]. It also includes [[Meta-analysis|meta-investigations]] about whether a best way to live or related standards exists. The main branches of ethics are [[normative ethics]], [[meta-ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

A major area of debate involves [[consequentialism]], in which actions are judged by the potential results of the act, such as to maximize happiness, called [[utilitarianism]], and [[deontology]], in which actions are judged by how they adhere to principles, irrespective of negative ends.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==== Aesthetics ====
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Aesthetics is the "critical reflection on art, culture and [[nature]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlisna.org/artdoc/vol18/iss2/01.pdf Review] by Tom Riedel ([[Regis University]])&lt;/ref&gt; It addresses the nature of [[art]], [[beauty]] and [[Taste (sociology)|taste]], enjoyment, emotional values, perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;“[[mwod:aesthetic|Aesthetic]].” ''[[Merriam-Webster dictionary|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]''. Retrieved 9 May 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more precisely defined as the study of [[Senses|sensory]] or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called [[judgment]]s of [[Feeling|sentiment]] and taste.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Zangwill|Zangwill, Nick]]. 2019 [2003]. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]" (revised ed.). ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''. 9 May 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; Its major divisions are art theory, [[literary theory]], [[film theory]] and [[music theory]]. An example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the [[Cubist]] aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.lexico.com/definition/aesthetic aesthetic]." ''[[Oxford Dictionaries|Lexico]]''. [[Oxford University Press]] and [[Dictionary.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[philosophy of film]] analyzes films and filmmakers for their philosophical content and explores film (images, cinema, etc.) as a medium for philosophical reflection and expression.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==== Political philosophy ====
{{Main|Political philosophy}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|right|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]], best known for his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', which expounded an influential formulation of [[social contract]] theory.]]

Political philosophy is the study of [[government]] and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the [[State (polity)|state]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} It includes questions about justice, law, property and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects, as both discuss the question of how people should live together.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Other branches of value theory:{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

* [[Philosophy of law]] (aka [[jurisprudence]]): explores the varying theories explaining the nature and interpretation of laws.
* [[Philosophy of education]]: analyzes the definition and content of education, as well as the goals and challenges of educators.
* [[Feminist philosophy]]: explores questions surrounding gender, sexuality and the body including the nature of [[feminism]] itself as a social and philosophical movement.
* [[Philosophy of sport]]: analyzes sports, games and other forms of play as sociological and uniquely human activities.

=== Logic, science and mathematics ===
Many academic disciplines generated philosophical inquiry. The relationship between "X" and the "philosophy of X" is debated. [[Richard Feynman]] argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to its primary study, saying that "[[philosophy of science]] is as useful to scientists as [[ornithology]] is to birds."{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} [[Curtis White (author)|Curtis White]] (2014), by contrast, argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities, sciences and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science Delusion: Asking the Big Questions in a Culture of Easy Answers|last=White|first=Curtis|date=2014|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=e2mPgcXPNNIC}}|publisher=Melville House|isbn=9781612193908|location=Brooklyn, NY|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The topics of philosophy of science are [[number]]s, symbols and the formal methods of reasoning as employed in the [[social science]]s and [[natural sciences]].

==== Logic ====
{{Main|Logic}}Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. An argument is "''a'' ''connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition''."{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} The connected series of statements are "[[premise]]s" and the proposition is the conclusion. For example:

# All humans are mortal. (premise)
# Socrates is a human. (premise)
# Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion)
[[Deductive reasoning]] is when, given certain premises, conclusions are [[Logical consequence|unavoidably implied]]. [[Rules of inference]] are used to infer conclusions such as, [[modus ponens]], where given “A” and “If A then B”, then “B” must be concluded.

Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carnap|first=Rudolf|date=1953|title=Inductive Logic and Science|jstor=20023651|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume=80|issue=3|pages=189–197|doi=10.2307/20023651|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; social sciences and humanities disciplines, logic became a [[formal science]]. Sub-fields include [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical logic]], [[Modal logic]], [[computational logic]] and [[non-classical logic]]s. A major question in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered, called mathematical realism, or invented, called mathematical antirealism.

==== Philosophy of science ====
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
This branch explores the foundations, methods, history, implications and purpose of science. Many of its sub-divisions correspond to a specific branch of science. For example, [[philosophy of biology]] deals specifically with the metaphysical, epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences. The [[philosophy of mathematics]] studies the philosophical assumptions, foundations and implications of mathematics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

=== History of philosophy ===
{{See also|Metaphilosophy|History of ethics}}
{{further|Philosophical progress|List of years in philosophy}}
Some philosophers specialize in one or more historical periods. The history of philosophy (study of a specific period, individual or school) is related to but not the same as the [[philosophy of history]] (the theoretical aspect of history, which deals with questions such as the nature of historical evidence and the possibility of objectivity).{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'' influenced many philosophers to interpret truth in light of history, a view called [[historicism]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

=== Philosophy of religion ===
{{Main|Philosophy of religion}}

Philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve [[religion]] and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective (as opposed to [[theology]] which begins from religious convictions).&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Louth|Louth, Andrew]], and [[Helmut Thielicke]]. 2014 [1999]. "[https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology/Relationship-to-philosophy Relationship to Philosophy | Theology]." ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper, the idea of a separate field only arose in the 19th century.&lt;ref group="lower-roman"&gt;Wainwright, William J. 2005. "Introduction." Pp. 3–11 in ''[https://books.google.ca/books?id=GbcuCf9TlDgC The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion]'', edited by W. J. Wainwright. New York: Oxford University Press.

"The expression “philosophy of religion” did not come into general use until the nineteenth century, when it was employed to refer to the articulation and criticism of humanity's religious consciousness and its cultural expressions in thought, language, feeling, and practice." ({{Google books|id=GbcuCf9TlDgC|page=3|title=Oxford Handbook}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues include the [[existence of God]], the relationship between reason and [[faith]], questions of [[religious epistemology]], the [[relationship between religion and science]], how to interpret [[religious experiences]], questions about the possibility of an [[afterlife]], the [[problem of religious language]] and the existence of [[souls]] and responses to [[religious pluralism]] and diversity.

=== Philosophical schools ===
Some philosophers specialize in one or more of the major philosophical schools, such as [[Continental philosophy]], [[Analytical philosophy]], [[Thomism]], [[Asian philosophy]] or [[African philosophy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

== Applied philosophy {{anchor|Applied philosophy}} ==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of academic disciplines]] and target of redirect [[Applied philosophy]] --&gt;
[[File:Martin Luther King Jr NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Martin Luther King Jr]] ]]
A variety of other academic and non-academic approaches have been explored. The ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs. [[Richard M. Weaver|Weaver]] argued that ideas have consequences. 

Philosophy yields applications such as those in [[ethics]]—[[applied ethics]] in particular—and [[political philosophy]]. The political and economic philosophies of [[Confucius]], [[Sun Tzu]], [[Chanakya]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Ibn Rushd]], [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Adam Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions. [[Progressive education]] as championed by [[John Dewey|Dewey]] had a profound impact on 20th-century US educational practices. Descendants of this movement include efforts in [[philosophy for children]], which are part of [[philosophy education]]. [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]]'s political [[philosophy of war]] has had a profound effect on [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[international politics]] and [[military strategy]] in the 20th century, especially around [[World War II]]. Logic is important in [[mathematics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]].

Other important applications can be found in [[epistemology]], which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge, sound evidence and justified belief (important in [[law]], [[economics]], [[decision theory]] and a number of other disciplines). The [[philosophy of science]] discusses the underpinnings of the [[scientific method]] and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. Philosophy thus has fundamental implications for science as a whole. For example, the strictly empirical approach of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. [[Deep ecology]] and [[animal rights]] examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. [[Aesthetics]] can help to interpret discussions of [[music]], [[literature]], the [[plastic arts]] and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general, the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields.

=== Society ===
{{main|Contemporary philosophy#Outside the profession}}
Many inquiries outside of academia are philosophical in the broad sense. Novelists, playwrights, filmmakers, and musicians, as well as scientists and others engage in recognizably philosophical activity.

Some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers, typically by working as [[professor]]s who teach, research and write in academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/where-can-philosophy-take-me|title=Where Can Philosophy Take Me? {{!}} Philosophy|website=philosophy.as.uky.edu|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law, journalism, religion, sciences, politics, business, or various arts.&lt;ref name="whystudyphilosophy.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whystudyphilosophy.com/|title=Why Study Philosophy?

==Professional philosophy==
Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy. The [[doctorate of philosophy|doctorate of philosophy (PhD)]] developed in Germany as the terminal Teacher's credential in the mid 17th century.&lt;ref name=EWG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |title=Erhard-Weigel-Gesellschaft: Biographie Weigels |website=Erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de |date= |accessdate=2016-11-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124147/http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |archivedate=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1817, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was the first philosopher to be appointed Professor by the State, namely by the Prussian Minister of Education, as an effect of Napoleonic reform in Prussia. In the United States, the professionalization grew out of reforms to the American higher-education system largely based on the German model.

Within the last century, philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities, like other academic disciplines. Accordingly, it has become less general and more specialized. In the view of one prominent recent historian: "Philosophy has become a highly organized discipline, done by specialists primarily for other specialists. The number of philosophers has exploded, the volume of publication has swelled, and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied. Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind, something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields."&lt;ref name="philosophical16"/&gt; Some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/socrates-tenured|title=Socrates Tenured – Rowman &amp; Littlefield International|website=www.rowmaninternational.com|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical, peer-reviewed journals. While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious, political or philosophical views that they consider their "philosophy", these views are rarely informed by or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today. Furthermore, unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books, magazines, and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace, works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare. Philosopher [[Michael Sandel]]'s book ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'' and [[Harry Frankfurt]]'s ''[[On Bullshit]]'' are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of non-philosophers. Both works became ''New York Times'' best sellers.

Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved.}} in {{harvnb|Honderich|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Projet de communauté philosophe''''' (translated as '''''Project for a Philosophical Community''''') is a book written by the [[French people|French]] philosopher [[Victor d'Hupay]], published in 1777.

== Review == 
This book can be seen as a cornerstone in the history of [[communism]], as it describes for the first time how "communists" (people living in a "[[commune]]") should understand this philosophy.{{Dubious|reason=Not consistent with RS. See discussion at d'Hupay's talk page.|date=July 2019}} 
In this work, the author advises to "share all economic and material products between inhabitants of the 'commune', so that all may benefit from everybody's work".&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Cassely, 2016"&gt;Cassely, 2016 : ''Aix insolite et secrète'' JonGlez {{pp.|192-193}} ([http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb45058387v references from the Bibliothèque nationale de France])&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in a 1785 letter to friend [[Restif de la Bretonne]], d'Hupay would describe himself as a "communist" author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hupay.fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191812/http://www.hupay.fr/ |archivedate=2017-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grandjonc Jacques, 1983"&gt;Grandjonc Jacques,1983: ''Quelques dates à propos des termes communiste et communisme'' In: Mots, n°7, Octobre 1983 {{p.|146}} ([http://www.persee.fr/doc/mots_0243-6450_1983_num_7_1_1122 reference on the Persée library])&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was partly written in d'Hupay's own [[bastide]] in [[Meyreuil]], near [[Aix-en-Provence]], where he was determined to set his own commune and live by the communist philosophy, with neighbours and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hupay.fr/pages/vie-d-hupay.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202024755/http://www.hupay.fr/pages/vie-d-hupay.html |archive-date=2017-02-02 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="7283" xml:space="preserve">{{about|the psychological term}}
In [[psychology]], [[economics]] and [[philosophy]], a '''preference''' is a technical term usually used in relation to choosing between [[wikt:alternative|alternatives]]. For example, someone prefers A over B if they would rather choose A than B.

Preference can also be used in [[insolvency]] terms.

==Psychology==

In [[psychology]], preferences refer to an individual's attitude towards a set of objects, typically reflected in an explicit [[decision-making]] process (Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic, 2006). The term is also used to mean evaluative judgment in the sense of liking or disliking an object (e.g., Scherer, 2005) which is the most typical definition employed in psychology. However, it does not mean that a preference is necessarily stable over time. Preference can be notably modified by decision-making processes, such as [[choices]] (Brehm, 1956; Sharot, De Martino, &amp; Dolan, 2009), even unconsciously (see Coppin, Delplanque, Cayeux, Porcherot, &amp; Sander, 2010). Consequently, preference can be affected by a person's surroundings and upbringing in terms of geographical location, cultural background, religious beliefs, and education. These factors are found to affect preference as repeated exposure to a certain idea or concept correlates with a positive preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajonc|first=Robert B.|last2=Markus|first2=Hazel|date=1982-09-01|title=Affective and Cognitive Factors in Preferences|url=http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/123|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–131|doi=10.1086/208905|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

{{main|Preference (economics)}}

In [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s, ''preference'' refers to the set of assumptions related to ordering some alternatives, based on the degree of [[happiness]], satisfaction, [[gratification]], enjoyment, or [[utility]] they provide, a process which results in an optimal "[[choice]]" (whether real or imagined). Although economists are usually not interested in choices or preferences in themselves, they are interested in the theory of choice because it serves as a background for empirical demand analysis.

The so-called [[Expected utility hypothesis|Expected Utility Theory (EUT)]], which was introduced by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1944, explains that so long as an agent's preferences over risky options follow a set of [[axiom]]s, then he is maximizing the expected value of a utility function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cognitive Basis of Institutions: A Synthesis of Behavioral and Institutional Economics|last=Teraji|first=Shinji|publisher=Academic Press|year=2018|isbn=9780128120231|location=London|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory specifically identified four axioms that determine an individual's preference when selecting an alternative out of a series of choices that maximizes expected utility for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finance and Psychology – A never-ending love story?!: Behavioural Finance and its impact on the credit crunch in 2009|last=Kemtzian|first=Patrick|publisher=GRIN Verlag|year=2012|isbn=9783656270577|location=Berlin|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experiments on Decisions under Risk: The Expected Utility Hypothesis|last=Schoemaker|first=P. J. H.|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2013|isbn=9789401750424|location=Dordrecht|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include Completeness, Transitivity, Independence, and, Continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Utility Theory: Volume 2: Extensions|last=Barbera|first=Salvador|last2=Hammond|first2=Peter|last3=Seidl|first3=Christian|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=2004|isbn=1402077149|location=Boston, MA|pages=761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
"Preference" may also refer to non-choices, such as [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[Biology|biological]] explanations for one's preference. [[Sexual orientation]], for example, is no longer considered a sexual preference by most individuals, but is debatable based on philosophical and/or scientific ideas.

==Insolvency==
In [[Insolvency]], the term can be used to describe when a company pays a specific creditor or group of creditors. From doing this, that creditor(s) is made better off, than other creditors. After paying the 'preferred creditor', the company seeks to go into a formal insolvency like an administration or liquidation.  There must be a desire to make the creditor better off, for them to be a preference. If the preference is proven, legal action can occur. It is a wrongful act of trading. Disqualification is a risk.&lt;ref name=Steven&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Keith|title=What Is A Preference Under The Insolvency Act 1986|url=https://www.companyrescue.co.uk/guides-knowledge/guides/what-is-a-preference-under-the-insolvency-act-1986-3748/|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preference arises within the context of the principle maintaining that one of the main objectives in the winding up of an insolvent company is to ensure the equal treatment of creditors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Company Law, Fourth Edition|last=Hannigan|first=Brenda|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780198722861|location=Oxford|pages=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules on preferences allow paying up their creditors as insolvency looms, but that it must prove that the transaction is a result of ordinary commercial considerations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, under the English [[Insolvency Act 1986]], if a creditor was proven to have forced the company to pay, the resulting payment would not be considered a preference since it would not constitute unfairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Corporate Finance Law: Principles and Policy, Second Edition|last=Gullifer|first=Louise|last2=Payne|first2=Jennifer|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781782259602|location=Oxford|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Orphan|date=October 2017}}

'''Philosophical ethology''' is a field of multidisciplinary research which gathers [[natural science]]s, social science, human studies and is dedicated to the issue of animal subjectivity.{{what|date=July 2019}} It is about an [[Ontology|ontological]] concept needing a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] place rather than a descriptive issue. With precursors in the 19th century, it emerged in its current in the 2010s.

== History ==
Philosophical ethology develops from the thought of continental philosophers, whose researches involve ethology, philosophy and [[anthropology]]. Those authors had taken up the challenges coming from biology, phenomenology, [[critical theory]], the [[Animal Studies]] and post-human philosophy. These are all disciplines dealing, each in its own way, with non-human animals and the interactions among living beings, in order to propose a new [[paradigm]] able to go beyond the limits of the [[anthropocentrism]], which underlay traditional theories.

The mean critics by those authors is the Cartesian heiress of automata:&lt;ref&gt;(IT) René Descartes, Discorso sul metodo, Opere, I, Roma-Bari, Laterza, [1637] 1967, pp. 129-182.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the classical ethology and behaviourism have described how the animal machine would work and which were the mechanisms regulating processes, nevertheless these authors did not challenge the mean idea, that is an animal is not a machine. Hence the need to elaborate a new multidisciplinary approach able to interpret the animal subjectivity ontologically speaking, and the different ontology correlated issues, such as the cultural dimensions, symbolicity and materiality in non-human animals and their intra and interspecific relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccat-lab.org/ccat-research-symposium-event-what-is-philosophical-ethology/ Report del convegno "What is Philosophical Ethology?" tenuto alla Curtin University (Australia) il 22 luglio 2015]{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ccat-lab.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three recent issues of magazine ''Angelaki. Journal of the Theoretical Humanities''&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Brett Buchanan, Jeffrey Bussolini &amp; Matthew Chrulew, [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cang20/current Philosophical ethology], in Angelaki. Journal of the Theoretical Humanities, I, II, III, Routledge, 2014 - 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; have explored the thought of three scholars considered among the most influential voices in the field of philosophical ethology by the editors of the magazine, Brett Buchanan, [[Jeffrey Bussolini]] and Matthew Chrulew: the three authos are Vinciane Despret, Dominique Lestel and Roberto Marchesini.

=== [[Vinciane Despret]] ===
Belgian philosopher and professor at the [[University of Liege]], Vinciane Despret has written many essays and articles about the history of ethology, psychology and human-animal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Vinciane Despret, Quando il lupo vivrà con l'agnello. Sguardo umano e comportamenti animali, Milano, Eleuthera, 2004, {{ISBN|978-8885060906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Vinciane Despret, Hans, il cavallo che sapeva contare, Milano, Eleuthera, 2005, {{ISBN|978-8885060982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All along her career, Despert has worked together with few authors from different disciplines (ethology, arts, literature) and with many non-human animals (elephants, mice, rats, monkeys).&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Brett Buchanan, Matthew Chrulew &amp; Jeffrey Bussolini, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1039821 On asking the right questions. An interview with Vinciane Despret], in Angelaki. Philosophical ethology II - Vinciane Despret, vol. 20, nº 2, Roudledge, 2015, pp. 165-178.&lt;/ref&gt; These encounters allowed her to build a unique research path.

In Despret’s writings, what is peculiar is the methodological approach and her anecdotal and idiosyncratic style: the author chooses to tell stories about animals (or, better, stories of relationship among animals, humans included) rather than to write about animals.
Focal point to the authors is ''asking the right questions'' to non-human animals.&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Vinciane Despret&amp;Brett Buchanan, What Would Animals Say If We Asked the Right Questions?, in Posthumanities, Minneapolis, University Of Minnesota Press, 2016, {{ISBN|978-0816692392}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that animals are not texts to hermeneutically interpret, not object to quest via scientific experiments, but they are subjects able to provide their own answers to the questions interesting to them.

Within philosophical ethology, Despret has stressed the repetitivity of any interspecific dialogue: non-human animals are being transformed by the encounter with the human beings, and, in the same way, human beings result transformed by the dialogue with the non-human. Despret’s stories are full of examples got by researchers, farmers, trainers – along with likewise important autobiographical reports – proving the enrichment coming from the encounter with the non-human animals.

=== Dominique Lestel ===
A French philosopher and ethologist, Lestel is "Maître de conférences" at École Normale Supérieure of Paris and director of a research team about eco-anthropology and etnonlogy at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum national d’histoire naturelle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://savoirs.ens.fr/conferencier.php?id=402 Dominique Lestel's Academic Positions], savoirs.ens.fr.&lt;/ref&gt;

His credit is stressing how a cultural phenomenon is not a human peculiarity.&lt;ref&gt;(FR) Dominique Lestel, Les origines animales de la culture, in Champs Essais, Paris, Flammarion, 2001, {{ISBN|978-2-0812-23042}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To Lestel, it necessary to see at anthropo-poiesis with an evolutionary and pluralist lens and at culture as a domain no longer apart from nature. It is necessary to become aware that we live in a multi-species society where each species produces their own kind of culture. This proximity of space and time among beings from different species allows the emergence of few sincere friendship and relationship, that have a historical, ethical and political importance, to Lestel.&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Matthew Chrulew, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0969725X.2014.976069 The animal outside the text. An interview with Dominique Lestel], in Angelaki. Philosophical ethology I: Dominique Lestel, vol. 19, nº 3, Routledge, 2014, pp. 187-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, during the International days of study GIS about human-animal held in Bologna, Lestel has rolled out his zoo-futurism, a philosophical artistic trend aiming to "re-animalise" the human being.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Dominique Lestel, [https://ilmanifesto.it/login L’animale è l’avvenire dell’umano. Guida allo zoo-futurismo], in il Manifesto, 29 ottobre 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roberto Marchesini ===
An Italian philosopher, ethologist and zooanthopologist, Marchesini is director of Siua (School of Human-Animal interaction), of Study Centre of post-human philosophy and professor at few Italian universities. For over 20 years, he is leading a multidisciplinary project research about Zooanthropology, posts-human philosophy and bioethics to demonstrate that non-human animals have a referent role during the identity structuring (anthropo-poiesis)&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, [http://www.metis.progedit.com/anno-iii-numero-1-giugno-2013-formare-tra-scienza-tecnica-tecnologia-temi/99-saggi/489-antropodecentramento-e-ibridazioni-progetto-posthuman-e-profilatura-identitaria.html Antropodecentramento e ibridazioni. Progetto Posthuman e profilatura identitaria] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914173324/http://www.metis.progedit.com/anno-iii-numero-1-giugno-2013-formare-tra-scienza-tecnica-tecnologia-temi/99-saggi/489-antropodecentramento-e-ibridazioni-progetto-posthuman-e-profilatura-identitaria.html |date=2017-09-14 }}, in MeTis. Mondi educativi, temi indagini suggestioni, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosophical consequences coming from this kind of relationship.

Main concepts in Marchesini’s thought are Zootropy and animal epiphany. With the term zootropy, Marchesini underlines the natural human tendency to turn to non-humans, like a kind of ''biophilia''&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Edward Osborne Wilson, Biophilia, Harvard University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|9780674074422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; rooted in our species that see in ethero-specifics some social counterparts able to contribute to anthropo-poiesis processes.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Fondamenti di zooantropologia. La zooantropologia teorica, Bologna, Apeiron, 2014, {{ISBN|9788887690132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side, with the concept of "animal epiphany", Marchesini points out the characteristic of enunciation and revelation coming from humans-non humans relationship. Animal diversity let human being imagine new existential paths – in the flight of a bird, human being cannot see just the phenomenon per se, but perceive a new dimension of the thinking ''it is possible to fly''&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Epifania animale. L'oltreuomo come rivelazione, Milano, Mimesis, 2014, p. 71, {{ISBN|978-8857521350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; – and experiment an hybridational tension leading to identity slidings.

With the essay ''Philosophical ethology'',&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Etologia filosofica. Alla ricerca della soggettività animale, Milano, Mimesis, 2016, {{ISBN|978-8857532332}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marchesini focus on subjectivity. To him, subjectivity is foundation to conscience, not the opposite. Animals get constantly engaged from the external world through new occurrences asking for creativity and initiative not explicable with any automatism.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) R. Marchesini, Intelligenza emotiva versus intelligenza cognitiva, in Pluriverso, vol. 3, La Nuova Italia, 2001, pp. 22-33.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, to Marchesini, desire connects animals and the world, desire make them acting in their present.

'''''Fides quaerens intellectum''''' means "faith seeking understanding" or "faith seeking intelligence". It is the [[Theology|theological]] method stressed by [[Augustine]] (354–430) and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] ({{circa|1033}}&amp;nbsp;– 1109) in which one begins with belief in [[faith]] and on the basis of that faith moves on to further understanding of Christian truth.&lt;ref&gt; Donald K. McKim, Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1996), 104&lt;/ref&gt; 
Anselm uses this expression for the first time in his [[Proslogion]] (II–IV). It articulates the close relationship between faith and [[Reason|human reason]]. This is the key to Anselm's theological thought and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] thinking. He would understand all things in faith. It means to understand intellectually what we already believe. Chronologically, faith precedes understanding, like when small children first trust their parents and believe what they state, and it is only later on, when they grow up, that they want to examine and understand the reality by themselves. In the words of Anselm of Canterbury : "Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam" ("I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand").

      <text bytes="19911" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|A philosophical idea or system which does not meet an expected set of standards}}
{{broader|Pseudo-scholarship}}
'''Pseudophilosophy''' (or '''cod philosophy''') is a philosophical idea or system which does not meet an expected set of standards. 

==Definitions==
According to Christopher Heumann, an 18th-century scholar, pseudo-philosophy has six characteristics:{{sfn|Hanegraaf|2012|p=131-134}}
# A preference for useless speculation
# It appeals merely to human authority
# It appeals to tradition instead of reason
# It syncretises philosophy with superstition
# It has a preference for obscure and enigmatic language and symbolism
# It is immoral

According to [[Michael Oakeshott]], pseudo-philosophy "is theorizing that proceeds partly within and partly outside a given mode of inquiry."{{sfn|Nardin|2001}}

[[Josef Pieper]] noted that there cannot be a closed system of philosophy, and that any philosophy that claims to have discovered a "cosmic formula" is a pseudo-philosophy.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} In this he follows Kant, who rejected the postulation of a "highest principle" from which to develop [[transcendental idealism]], calling this pseudo-philosophy and mysticism.{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}

[[Nicholas Rescher]], in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', described ''pseudo-philosophy'' as "deliberations that masquerade as philosophical but are inept, incompetent, deficient in intellectual seriousness, and reflective of an insufficient commitment to the pursuit of truth."{{sfn|Honderich|1995|p=765}} Rescher adds that the term is particularly appropriate when applied to "those who use the resources of reason to substantiate the claim that rationality is unachievable in matters of inquiry."{{sfn|Honderich|1995|p=765}}

==History==
{{See also|Philosophy}}

The term "pseudo-philosophy" appears to have been coined by [[Jane Austen]].{{sfn|Johnson|Tuite|2011}}

[[Ernest Newman]], an English music critic and [[musicologist]], who aimed at intellectual objectivity in his style of criticism, in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, published in 1897 ''Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century'', a critique of imprecise and subjective writing.

According to Josef Pieper, for Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle philosophy is the human search "oriented toward [[Sophia (wisdom)|wisdom]] such as God possesses".{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} It suggests that philosophy includes, in its essence, an orientation toward theology.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} Pieper notes:
{{quote|Thus something is being expressed here that clearly contradicts what in the modern age has become the accepted notion of philosophy; for this new conception of philosophy assumes that it is the decisive feature of philosophical thought to disentangle itself from theology, faith and tradition.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}}}}

==Usage==
The term is almost always used [[pejorative]]ly and is often contentious, due to differing criteria for demarcating pseudophilosophy (see also: [[Demarcation problem]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Romanticism===
{{Main|Romanticism}}{{See also|Age of Enlightenment}}

According to physicist and philosopher of science [[Mario Bunge]],
{{quote|Pseudophilosophy is nonsense parading as deep philosophy. It may have existed since Lao-Tzu, but it was not taken seriously until about 1800, when the Romantics challenged the Enlightenment. By giving up rationality, they generated a lot of pseudophilosophy...{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}}}}

For Kant, intellectual knowledge is discursive knowledge, not intuitive knowledge.{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} According to Kant, intuition is limited to the realm of senses, while knowledge is "essentially realised in the acts of researching, relating, comparing, differentiating, inferring, proving".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} Kant criticised Romantic philosophy, which is based on feeling and intuition,{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}} and not on "philosophical work":{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}}
{{quote|In philosophy, Kant writes, "the law of reason, of acquiring possessions through work", prevails. And because it is not work, the Romantic philosophy is not genuine philosophy – an objection that is also leveled by Kant against Plato, the "father of all rapturous fantasizing in philosophy", while it is noted, with both approval and assent, that "the philosophy of Aristotle is, by contrast, work".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13-14}}}}

Kant called Romantic philosophy pseudo-philosophy, "in which one is entitled not to work, but only to heed and enjoy the oracle in oneself in order to take complete possession of that wisdom toward which philosophy aims".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}}

===Mysticism===
{{Main|Mysticism}}

Mysticism has a long history. In the Age of Enlightenment mysticism had fallen into disrepute.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} Kant called mysticism pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} In the 19th century, with the rise of Romanticism, interest in mysticism was renewed. Rationalists and Lutherans wrote histories of mysticism to reject its claims, but there was a widespread interest in spiritualism and related phenomena.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}}

Interest in [[Meister Eckhart|Eckhart's works]] was revived in the early nineteenth century, especially by German Romantics and [[German idealism|Idealist]] philosophers.{{sfn|McGinn|2001|p=1}}{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxvii}} Since the 1960s debate has been going on in Germany whether Eckhart should be called a "mystic".{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxii}} The philosopher [[Karl Albert]] had already argued that Eckhart had to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism of [[Parmenides]], [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]] and other [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonistic]] thinkers.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}} Heribert Fischer argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a mediaeval theologian.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}}

===German Idealism===
{{Main|German Idealism}}

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] wrote the following about [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]:
{{quote|If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudophilosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.{{sfn|Schopenhauer|1965|p=15-16}}}}

A hundred and fifty years after Schopenhauer's death, physicist and philosopher of science [[Mario Bunge]] recommended "avoiding the pseudo-subtleties of Hegelian dialectics",{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=124}} and wrote of "Hegel's disastrous legacy": "It is true that Marx and Engels criticized Hegel's idealism, but they did not repudiate his cult of nonsense and his rejection of all modern science from Newton on."{{sfn|Bunge|2012|p=85–86}} Bunge noted,
{{quote|True, Hegel tackled a number of important problems, so his work cannot be dismissed lightly. However, his work, when understandable at all, was usually wrong in the light of the most advanced science of his own time. Worse, it enshrined the equivocation that depth must be obscure.{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}}}}

===Continental philosophy===
{{Main|Continental philosophy|Analytic philosophy}}

Soccio notes that analytical inclined philosophers tend to dismiss Heidegger's philosophy as pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Soccio|2011|p=497}} According to Christensen, Heidegger himself called the philosophy of Husserl ''scheinphilosophy''.{{sfn|Christensen|2008|p=7}}

===Scientism===
{{Main|Scientism}}

[[Dietrich von Hildebrand]] used the term to critique the central place modern science is occupying in western society:
{{quote|This pseudo philosophy, in which science takes the place of metaphysics and religion, more and more corrodes the life of man, making him more and more blind to the real cosmos, in all its plenitude, depth and mystery ... Today we are witnessing a revolt against the deformation expressed in this pseudo philosophy.{{sfn|Von Hildebrand|1960|p=7}}}}

===Objectivism===
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Journalist [[Jonathan Chait]] used the term to criticize the work of [[Ayn Rand]] in "Ayn Rand's Pseudo-Philosophy", an article in ''[[The New Republic]]'', in which he wrote, "She was a true amateur who insisted on seeing herself as the greatest human being who ever lived because she was almost completely unfamiliar with the entire philosophical canon."&lt;ref name="chait"/&gt; Physicist and philosopher of science [[Mario Bunge]] classified Rand as a "mercenary", among those who "seek to defend or propagate a doctrine rather than an analyzing ideas or searching for new truths",{{sfn|Bunge|2012|pp=10–11}} while science writer and skeptic [[Michael Shermer]] claimed that "it becomes clear that Objectivism was (and is) a cult, as are many other, non-religious groups".&lt;ref name="shermer"/&gt; The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' said of Rand, "For all her popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SEP |url-id=ayn-rand |title=Ayn Rand |edition=Fall 2017 |first=Neera K. |last=Badhwar |first2=Roderick T. |last2=Long |author2-link=Roderick T.

{{orphan|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Norbert wiener.jpg|thumb|right|Norbert Weiner, the founder of cybernetics.]]
'''Dualism in cybernetics''' refers to systems or problems in which one or more [[intelligent]] adversaries attempt to exploit the weaknesses of the investigator. Examples could include a game-playing opponent, adversarial law, evolutionary systems of predator/parasite and prey/host, or politics/enslavement attempts.

== Background ==
Dualism in cybernetics emerged from the notion that there is another form of dualism besides the classical mind-matter dualism and this is the form-matter variant first proposed by the philosopher [[Anaxagoras]] and further developed by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harmonies of Disorder: Norbert Wiener: A Mathematician-Philosopher of Our Time|last=Montagnini|first=Leone|date=2017|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319506562|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norbert Wiener]], the founder of [[cybernetics]], used this as the basis of his position that information is a different reality from matter and energy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the foundational discipline of cybernetics that he developed, Wiener also drew from the Cartesian dualism, which differentiated non-cognitive body and non-extended/disembodied mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Onlife Manifesto: Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|date=2014|publisher=Springer Open|year=|isbn=9783319040929|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined a dualism that opposed matter/energy with information and proposed that it is possible for the living and non-living to be within the same wall that once divided them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gregory Bateson]] contributed to the development of this notion of dualism through his ''theory of mind'', which proposed that the mind extends the boundaries of the brain and body so that it is able to take multiple feedback loops, which then creates the link between organisms and the rest of the natural world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Systemic Intervention: Philosophy, Methodology, and Practice|last=Midgley|first=Gerald|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9781461542018|location=New York|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key element here is the concept of feedback, which allows the identification of causal loops so that a system is able to make changes to its behavior and receive information back from the environment concerning the change of such behavioral change, using it as a basis for future actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This cybernetic idea challenged the traditional subject/object dualism.

== Opposition vs complexity ==
Wiener contrasted "[[Manichean]] devils" (dualistic adversarial systems) with "[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] devils"—systems or problems that, though very complex and difficult to figure out, did not feature an adversary with contrary intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubberly.com/articles/cybernetics-and-counterculture.html|title=How cybernetics connects computing, counterculture, and design|website=www.dubberly.com|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrelevant citation|date=July 2019}} Victories or "expansions of knowledge" in the latter type of system were able to be built upon incrementally, through science (experimentation expanding empirical knowledge bases). Wiener noted that temporary weaknesses (such as errors to perceive all components of a system) were not fatal in attempts to defeat "Augustinian devils" because another experiment could simply be pursued (and he noted that he had personally defeated many "Augustinian devils" with his contributions to science and engineering). By contrast, Wiener observed that temporary lapses in judgment against "Manichean devils" were more often fatal or destructive, due to the desire of the opponent to "win/survive at all costs", even by introducing deception into the system. He said that he had been defeated by many "Manichean devils", such as on occasions when he was temporarily careless in chess.

Although this duality between complexity (in the case of the Augustinian devils) and opposition (in the case of Manichean devils) may seem obvious, it holds deep implications for many areas of science, such as [[game theory]], [[political science]], [[computer science]], [[network science]], [[Security|security science]], [[military science]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Cont/ContSato.htm|title=20th WCP: The Significance of System Cybernetics for Contemporary Philosophy- Post-Modernity in System Cybernetics|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrelevant citation|date=July 2019}}

'''Critical thinking''' is the analysis of [[fact]]s to form a judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=The International Center for the Assessment of Higher Order Thinking (ICAT, US)/Critical Thinking Community|accessdate=2017-03-22|author=Edward M.

Critical thinking is [[Self-directedness|self-directed]], [[Discipline|self-disciplined]], self-[[Monitoring (medicine)|monitored]], and self-[[Corrective feedback|corrective]] thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clarke|first=John|title=Critical Dialogues: Thinking Together in Turbulent Times|date=2019|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=978-1-4473-5097-2|location=Bristol|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It presupposes assent to rigorous standards of [[excellence]] and mindful command of their use. It entails effective communication and problem-solving abilities as well as a commitment to overcome native [[egocentrism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telacommunications.com/nutshell/stages.htm|title=Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development|website=www.telacommunications.com|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201204/it-s-fine-line-between-narcissism-and-egocentrism|title=It's a Fine Line Between Narcissism and Egocentrism|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociocentrism]].

==History==
The earliest records of critical thinking are the teachings of [[Socrates]] recorded by [[Plato]]. These included a part in Plato's early dialogues, where Socrates engages with one or more interlocutors on the issue of ethics such as question whether it was right for Socrates to escape from prison.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Visser|first=Jan|title=Seeking Understanding: The Lifelong Pursuit to Build the Scientific Mind|last2=Visser|first2=Muriel|date=2019|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-41680-2|location=Leiden|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher considered and reflected on this question and came to the conclusion that escape violates all the things that he holds higher than himself: the laws of Athens and the guiding voice that Socrates claims to hear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Socrates established the fact that one cannot depend upon those in "authority" to have sound knowledge and insight. He demonstrated that persons may have power and high position and yet be deeply confused and irrational. Socrates maintained that for an individual to have a good life or to have one that is worth living, he must be critical questioner or must have an interrogative soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stanlick|first=Nancy A.|title=Asking Good Questions: Case Studies in Ethics and Critical Thinking|last2=Strawser|first2=Michael J.|date=2015|publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=978-1-58510-755-1|location=Indianapolis|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established the importance of asking deep questions that probe profoundly into thinking before we accept ideas as worthy of belief.

Socrates established the importance of "seeking evidence, closely examining reasoning and assumptions, analyzing basic concepts, and tracing out implications not only of what is said but of what is done as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chiarini|first=Andrea|title=Understanding the Lean Enterprise: Strategies, Methodologies, and Principles for a More Responsive Organization|last2=Found|first2=Pauline|last3=Rich|first3=Nicholas|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-19994-8|location=Cham|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; His method of questioning is now known as "[[Socratic questioning]]" and is the best known critical thinking teaching strategy. In his mode of questioning, Socrates highlighted the need for thinking for clarity and logical consistency. He asked people questions to reveal their irrational thinking or lack of reliable knowledge. Socrates demonstrated that having authority does not ensure accurate knowledge. He established the method of questioning beliefs, closely inspecting assumptions and relying on evidence and sound rationale. Plato recorded Socrates' teachings and carried on the tradition of critical thinking. Aristotle and subsequent Greek skeptics refined Socrates' teachings, using systematic thinking and asking questions to ascertain the true nature of reality beyond the way things appear from a glance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/a-brief-history-of-the-idea-of-critical-thinking/408|title=A Brief History of the Idea of Critical Thinking|website=www.criticalthinking.org|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates set the agenda for the tradition of critical thinking, namely, to reflectively question common beliefs and explanations, carefully distinguishing beliefs that are reasonable and logical from those that—however appealing to our native egocentrism, however much they serve our vested interests, however comfortable or comforting they may be—lack adequate evidence or rational foundation to warrant belief.

Critical thinking was described by Richard W. Paul as a movement in two waves (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=181–98|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "first wave" of critical thinking is often referred to as
a 'critical analysis' that is clear, [[rationality|rational]] thinking involving [[critique]]. Its details vary amongst those who [[operational definition|define]] it. According to Barry K. Beyer (1995), critical thinking means making clear, reasoned judgments. During the process of critical thinking, ideas should be reasoned, well thought out, and judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://myweb.wvnet.edu/~jelkins/critproj/overview.html|title = The Critical Thinking Movement: Alternating Currents in One Teacher's Thinking|first = James R.|last = Elkins|accessdate = 23 March 2014|website = myweb.wvnet.edu|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180613084853/http://myweb.wvnet.edu/~jelkins/critproj/overview.html|archive-date = 13 June 2018|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. National Council for Excellence in Critical Thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org//|title=Critical Thinking Index Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines critical thinking as the "&lt;nowiki&gt;intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.&lt;/nowiki&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and origin of critical thinking==
In the term ''critical thinking'', the word ''[[wikt:critical|critical]]'', (Grk. κριτικός = ''kritikos'' = "critic") derives from the word ''critic'' and implies a [[critique]]; it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means "of judging", "of judgement", "for judging", and of being "able to discern".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lesley. (ed.) ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993) p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual roots of critical&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dictionary.com/e/critical-thinking/|title=Lexical Investigations: Critical Thinking - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2013-06-25|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking are as ancient as its etymology, traceable, ultimately, to the [[Teachings and philosophy of Swami Vivekananda|teaching]] practice and vision of [[Socrates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/socrates-9488126|title=Socrates|website=Biography|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,500 years ago who discovered by a method of probing questioning that people could not rationally justify their confident claims to [[knowledge]].

==Definitions==
Traditionally, critical thinking has been variously defined as follows:
* "The process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusion"&lt;ref name="reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/critical|title=Critical – Define Critical at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Thinking about one's thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify, raise the efficiency of, and recognize errors and biases in one's own thinking. Critical thinking is not 'hard' thinking nor is it directed at solving problems (other than 'improving' one's own thinking). Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the [[rationality]] of the thinker. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems—one uses critical thinking to improve one's process of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Kirby; letter to Olivetti, Laguna Salada Union School District, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Critical thinking is a type of thinking pattern that requires people to be reflective, and pay attention to decision-making which guides their beliefs and actions. Critical thinking allows people to deduct with more logic, to process sophisticated information and to look at various sides of issues, so that  they can produce more solid conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=February 1988|title=Book Reviews and Notes : Teaching Thinking Skills: Theory and Practice.

* Although critical thinking could be defined in several different ways, there is a general agreement in its key component—the desire to reach for a satisfactory result, and this should be achieved by rational thinking and result-driven manner. Halpern thinks that critical thinking firstly involves learned abilities such as problem-solving, calculation and successful probability application. It also includes a tendency to engage the thinking process. In recent times, Stanovich believed that modern IQ test could hardly measure the ability of critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Halpern|first=Diane F.|editor3-first=Diane F|editor3-last=Halpern|editor2-first=Henry L|editor2-last=Roediger Iii|editor1-first=Robert J|editor1-last=Sternberg|chapter=The Nature and Nurture of Critical Thinking|pages=1–14|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511804632|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511804632.002|title=Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary critical thinking scholars have expanded these traditional definitions to include qualities, concepts, and processes such as creativity, imagination, discovery, reflection, empathy, connecting knowing, feminist theory, subjectivity, ambiguity, and inconclusiveness.  Some definitions of critical thinking exclude these subjective practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reference.com" /&gt;

==Logic and rationality==
{{main|Logic and rationality}}
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016|reason=need to follow standard wikipedia reference style}}{{Cleanup section|reason=Poor grammar.|date=January 2019}}
The ability to reason logically is a fundamental skill of rational agents, hence the study of the form of correct argumentation is relevant to the study of critical thinking. It is, therefore, linked to the field of logic, which is concerned with the analysis of arguments, including the appraisal of their correctness or incorrectness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Salmon|first=Merrilee H.|title=Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking, Sixth Edition|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-04975-3|location=Boston, MA|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another interpretation holds that in the field of epistemology, critical thinking is considered as the logically correct thinking, which allows the differentiation between the logically true and the logically false statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sherrie|first=Wisdom|title=Handbook of Research on Advancing Critical Thinking in Higher Education|date=2015|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-8412-6|location=Hershey, PA|pages=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"First wave" logical [[thinking]] consists of understanding the connections between two concepts or points in thought. It follows a philosophy where the [[Thought|thinker]] is removed from the train of thought, while the connections and its analysis are devoid of any bias. [[Kerry S. Walters]] describes this ideology in his essay ''Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking'' as follows: "A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective. This model of [[thinking]] has become so entrenched in conventional academic wisdom that many educators accept it as canon".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt; The adoption of these principals parallels themselves with the increasing reliance on a quantitative understanding of the world.

In the ‘second wave’ of critical thinking, as defined by Walters,&lt;ref name="Walters1994" /&gt; many authors moved away from the logocentric mode of critical thinking that the ‘first wave’ privileged, especially in institutions of higher [[learning]]. Scholars began to take a more inclusive view of what constituted critical thinking, but rationality and logic are still widely accepted in many circles as the primary examples of critical thinking. Walters summarizes logicism as "the unwarranted assumption that good thinking is reducible to logical thinking".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

===Deduction, abduction and induction===
[[File:Argument terminology used in logic (en).svg|thumb|500px|right|[[Argument]] terminology used in [[logic]]]]
{{main|logical reasoning}}
There are three types of [[logical reasoning]]. Informally, two kinds of logical reasoning can be distinguished in addition to formal [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], which are [[inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[abductive reasoning|abduction]].

====Deduction====
* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] is the conclusion drawn from the structure of an argument's [[premises]], by use of [[rules of inference]] formally those of [[Propositional calculus#Basic and derived argument forms|propositional calculus]].
  e.g., X is human and all humans have a face, so X has a face.

====Induction====
* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] is drawing a conclusion from a pattern that is guaranteed by the strictness of the structure to which it applies.
e.g. '''The sum of even integers is even.'''

Let &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z} &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;2x,2y,2z&lt;/math&gt; are even by definition.  &lt;math&gt;2x+2y=2(x+y)=2z&lt;/math&gt;, which is even; so summing two even numbers results in an even number.

====Abduction====
* [[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]] is drawing a conclusion using a [[heuristic]] that is likely, but not inevitable given some foreknowledge.
  e.g., I observe sheep in a field, and they appear white from my viewing angle, so sheep are white.
       Contrast with the deductive statement:"Some sheep are white on at least one side."
&lt;!--Start copypasta--&gt;

===Critical thinking and rationality===
[[Kerry S. Walters]], an emeritus philosophy professor from [[Gettysburg College]], argues that rationality demands more than just logical or traditional methods of problem solving and analysis or what he calls the "calculus of justification" but also considers "[[cognitive]] acts such as [[imagination]], conceptual creativity, [[intuition]] and insight" (p.&amp;nbsp;63). These "functions" are focused on discovery, on more abstract processes instead of linear, rules-based approaches to problem-solving. The linear and non-sequential mind must both be engaged in the [[rational]] [[mind]].&lt;ref name="Walters1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kerry S. Walters|title=Re-Thinking Reason: New Perspectives in Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfT32n2Hvd0C|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2095-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to critically analyze an argument – to dissect structure and components, thesis and reasons – is essential. But so is the ability to be flexible and consider non-traditional alternatives and perspectives. These complementary functions are what allow for critical thinking to be a practice encompassing imagination and intuition in cooperation with traditional modes of deductive inquiry.&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

==Functions==
The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation, interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, and [[metacognition]]. According to Reynolds (2011), an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance:&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Martin (2011). Critical thinking and systems thinking: towards a critical literacy for systems thinking in practice. In: Horvath, Chrii. and Forte, James M. eds. Critical Thinking. New York: Nova Science Publishers, pp. 37–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence through reality
* Context skills to isolate the problem from context
* Relevant criteria for making the judgment well
* Applicable methods or techniques for forming the judgment
* Applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at hand

In addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills, one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills. Critical thinking employs not only [[logic]] but broad [[intellect]]ual criteria such as clarity, [[credibility]], [[accuracy]], precision, [[relevance]], depth, [[breadth]], significance, and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first= Elizabeth A., &amp; And Others |year=1995|title= National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identifying College Graduates' Essential Skills in Writing, Speech and Listening, and Critical Thinking.

Critical thinking calls for the ability to:
* Recognize problems, to find workable means for meeting those problems
* Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem-solving
* Gather and marshal pertinent (relevant) information
* Recognize [[unstated assumption]]s and values
* Comprehend and use [[language]] with accuracy, clarity, and [[wikt:discernment|discernment]]
* Interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments
* Recognize the existence (or non-existence) of logical relationships between propositions
* Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations
* Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives
* Reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience
* Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life

In sum:

"A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends."&lt;ref name=glaser&gt;{{Cite book| title=An Experiment in the Development of Critical Thinking| edition=| author=Edward M. Glaser| year=1941| publisher=New York, Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University| isbn=978-0-404-55843-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habits or Traits of the Mind==
The habits of [[mind]] that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead, a systematic approach to problem solving, [[inquisitiveness]], even-handedness, and confidence in [[reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identification of the Skills to be Taught, Learned, and Assessed, NCES 94–286, US Dept of Education, Addison Greenwood (Ed), Sal Carrallo (PI). See also, Critical thinking: A statement of expert consensus for purposes of educational assessment and instruction. ERIC Document No. ED 315–423&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a definition analysis by Kompf &amp; Bond (2001), critical thinking involves problem solving, decision making, [[metacognition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html|title=Teaching Metacognition|website=Metacognition|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; rationality, rational thinking, [[reasoning]], [[knowledge]], [[intelligence]] and also a moral component such as reflective thinking. Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development, possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills.

There is a postulation by some writers that the tendencies from habits of mind should be thought as virtues to demonstrate the characteristics of a critical thinker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Facione|first=Peter A.|last2=Sánchez|first2=Carol A.|last3=Facione|first3=Noreen C.|last4=Gainen|first4=Joanne|date=1995|journal=The Journal of General Education|volume=44|issue=1|pages=1–25|issn=0021-3667|jstor=27797240|title=The Disposition Toward Critical Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[intellectual virtue]]s are ethical qualities that encourage motivation to think in particular ways towards specific circumstances. However, these virtues have also been criticized by skeptics, who argue that there is lacking evidence for this specific mental basis that are causative to critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bailin|first=Sharon|last2=Case|first2=Roland|last3=Coombs|first3=Jerrold R.|last4=Daniels|first4=Leroi B.|date=May 1999|title=Common misconceptions of critical thinking|journal=Journal of Curriculum Studies|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=269–283|doi=10.1080/002202799183124|issn=0022-0272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research in Critical Thinking==
Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:&lt;ref name=glaser/&gt;

# An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences
# Knowledge of the methods of logical [[inquiry]] and reasoning
# Some skill in applying those methods.
Educational programs aimed at developing critical thinking in children and adult learners, individually or in group problem solving and decision making contexts, continue to address these same three central elements.

The Critical Thinking project at Human Science Lab, [[London]], is involved in the scientific study of all major [[educational system]]s in prevalence today to assess how the systems are working to promote or impede critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/research/| title=Research at Human Science Lab |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, S.A. (2002) "Two Systems of Reasoning," in ''Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment'', Govitch, Griffin, Kahneman (Eds), Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79679-8}}; ''Thinking and Reasoning in Human Decision Making: The Method of Argument and Heuristic Analysis'', Facione and Facione, 2007, California Academic Press.  {{ISBN|978-1-891557-58-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This presents a problem which is detailed as a division of a critical mind in juxtaposition to sensory data and memory.

The psychological theory disposes of the absolute nature of the rational mind, in reference to conditions, abstract problems and discursive limitations. Where the relationship between critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions is an empirical question, the ability to attain causal domination exists, for which Socrates was known to be largely disposed against as the practice of [[Sophist]]ry. Accounting for a measure of "critical thinking dispositions" is the California Measure of Mental Motivation&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OT12dZ0binIC&amp;pg=PA46 ''Research on Sociocultural Influences on Motivation and Learning''], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Catherine, M.|year=2007|title=California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory: Further Factor Analytic Examination|journal= Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=104|issue=1|pages=141–151|doi=10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151|pmid=17450973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Critical Thinking Toolkit is an alternative measure that examines student beliefs and attitudes about critical thinking&lt;ref&gt;Stupple, E.

Development of the Critical Thinking Toolkit (CriTT): A measure of student attitudes and beliefs about critical thinking. Thinking Skills and Creativity, 23, 91-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[John Dewey]] is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner, the community, and the entire democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1910). ''How we think.'' Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of [[internalization]], in the construction of basic ideas, principles, and theories inherent in content.  And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application, whereby those ideas, principles, and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners' lives.

Each discipline adapts its use of critical thinking concepts and principles. The core concepts are always there, but they are embedded in subject-specific content. For students to learn content, intellectual engagement is crucial. All students must do their own thinking, their own construction of knowledge. Good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions, readings, activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject.

Historically, the teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic. This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking. However, a second wave of critical thinking, urges educators to value conventional techniques, meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker. In 1994, Kerry Walters&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Kerry. (1994). ''Re-Thinking Reason''. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors’ research regarding connected knowing, empathy, gender-sensitive ideals, collaboration, world views, intellectual autonomy, morality and enlightenment. These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking.

In the English and Welsh school systems, ''Critical Thinking'' is offered as a subject that 16- to 18-year-olds can take as an [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]]. Under the [[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]], students can sit two exam papers for the AS: "Credibility of Evidence" and "Assessing and Developing Argument". The full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is now available: in addition to the two AS units, candidates sit the two papers "Resolution of Dilemmas" and "Critical Reasoning". The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about, and analyze, arguments on their deductive or inductive validity, as well as producing their own arguments. It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making. However, due to its comparative lack of subject content, many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html Critical Thinking FAQs from Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080411150135/http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html |date=11 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the AS is often useful in developing reasoning skills, and the full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is useful for degree courses in politics, philosophy, history or [[theology]], providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful, for example, in biblical study.

There used to also be an [[Advanced Extension Award]] offered in Critical Thinking in the UK, open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level. [[Cambridge International Examinations]] have an A-level in Thinking Skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/alevel/subject/aleveldetails?assdef_id=765_804|title=Cambridge International AS and A Level subjects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008, [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance]] has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php "New GCEs for 2008"], Assessment and Qualifications Alliance {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217221100/http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php |date=17 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]] have also modified theirs for 2008. Many examinations for university entrance set by universities, on top of A-level examinations, also include a critical thinking component, such as the [[LNAT]], the [[UKCAT]], the [[BioMedical Admissions Test]] and the [[Thinking Skills Assessment]].

In [[Qatar]], critical thinking was offered by [[AL-Bairaq]]—an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind [[AL-Bairaq]] is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |access-date=5 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title = Welcome to Al-Bairaq World |archive-date=19 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification |date=November 2016 }}

===Effectiveness===
In 1995, a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher [[education]] was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Gardiner, Redesigning Higher Education: Producing Dramatic Gains in Student Learning, in conjunction with: ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
The study noted concerns from higher [[education]], [[politician]]s, and [[business]] that higher education was failing to meet society's requirements for well-educated citizens.  It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students' [[thinking]] skills, in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of [[cognition]], rather than developing intellect or [[values]].

In a more recent meta-analysis, researchers reviewed 341 quasi- or true-experimental studies, all of which used some form of standardized critical thinking measure to assess the outcome variable.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"&gt;Abrami, P. C., Bernard, R. M., Borokhovski, E., Waddington, D. I., Wade, C. A., &amp; Persson, T. (2014). Strategies for Teaching Students to Think Critically: A Meta-Analysis. Review of Educational Research, 1–40&lt;/ref&gt; The authors describe the various methodological approaches and attempt to categorize the differing assessment tools, which include standardized tests (and second-source measures), tests developed by teachers, tests developed by researchers, and tests developed by teachers who also serve the role as the [[researcher]].  The results emphasized the need for exposing students to real-world problems and the importance of encouraging open dialogue within a supportive environment.  Effective strategies for teaching critical thinking are thought to be possible in a wide variety of [[educational]] settings.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"/&gt; One attempt to assess the [[humanities]]' role in teaching critical thinking and reducing belief in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims was made at [[North Carolina State University]]. Some success was noted and the researchers emphasized the value of the humanities in providing the skills to evaluate current events and qualitative data in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Frazier |first = Kendrick |author-link = Kendrick Frazier |title = Humanities, Too: In New Study, History Courses in Critical Thinking Reduce Pseudoscientific Beliefs |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |year = 2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lilienfeld]] notes that there is some evidence to suggest that basic critical thinking skills might be successfully taught to children at a younger age than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lilienfeld |first=Scott |author-link = Scott Lilienfeld |title=Teaching Skepticism: How Early Can We Begin? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |year=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=30–31 |url = https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180810182835/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in academics==
Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines (by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions, evidence sources, criteria, etc.). Within the framework of [[scientific skepticism]], the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a [[theory of justification|well-justified]] conclusion. The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application. Critical thinking forms, therefore, a system of related, and overlapping, modes of thought such as anthropological thinking, sociological thinking, historical thinking, political thinking, [[psychological]] thinking, philosophical thinking, mathematical thinking, chemical thinking, biological thinking, ecological thinking, legal thinking, ethical thinking, musical thinking, thinking like a painter, sculptor, engineer, business person, etc. In other words, though critical thinking principles are universal, their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective [[contextualism|contextualization]]. Psychology offerings, for example, have included courses such as Critical Thinking about the [[Paranormal]], in which students are subjected to a series of [[cold reading]]s and tested on their belief of the "psychic", who is eventually announced to be a fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Baugher |first1=Bob |last2=Haldeman |first2=Philip |date=July–August 2019 |title=Teaching College Students Critical Thinking Skills by Posing as a 'Registered Psychic' |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is considered important in the academic fields for enabling one to analyze, evaluate, explain, and restructure thinking, thereby ensuring the act of thinking without false belief. However, even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, mistakes occur, and due to a thinker's inability to apply the methodology consistently, and because of overruling character traits such as [[egocentrism]]. Critical thinking includes identification of [[prejudice]], [[bias]], propaganda, self-deception, distortion, [[misinformation]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/fallacy/biases.php |title=[F08] Cognitive biases |last1=Lau |first1=Joe |last2=Chan |first2=Jonathan |date= |website=Critical thinking web |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given research in [[cognitive psychology]], some [[education|educators]] believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical thinking [[skill]]s and cultivation of intellectual traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/critical-thinking-moral-integrity-and-citizenship-teaching-for-the-intellectual-virtues/487 |title=Critical Thinking, Moral Integrity and Citizenship |date= |website=Criticalthinking.org |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process. Through the use of critical thinking, nurses can question, evaluate, and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice. Critical thinking skills can help nurses problem solve, reflect, and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face. Critical thinking creates "new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.00925.x | volume=29 | title=Catching the wave: understanding the concept of critical thinking | year=1999 | journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing | pages=577–583 | last1 = Boychuk Duchscher | first1 = Judy E.| issue=3 | pmid=28796334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sociocultural, environmental, and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery, it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing. Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection. This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies (2006).&lt;ref&gt;College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for
[http://www.cno.org/Global/4-LearnAboutStandardsAndGuidelines/prac/learn/modules/profstands/slides/Competence.pdf Continuing Competencies (2006)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912093242/http://www.cno.org/Global/4-LearnAboutStandardsAndGuidelines/prac/learn/modules/profstands/slides/Competence.pdf |date=12 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It requires nurses to engage in [[Reflective Practice]] and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the College.

Critical thinking is also considered important for [[human rights education]] for [[toleration]]. The [[International Day for Tolerance|Declaration of Principles on Tolerance]] adopted by [[UNESCO]] in 1995 affirms that "education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others, and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement, ''critical thinking'' and ethical [[reasoning]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website = UNESCO |title=International Day for Tolerance . Declaration of Principles on Tolerance, Article 4, 3 |url = http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13175&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |access-date = 2016-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Thinking in Computer-mediated Communication==
The advent and rising popularity of online courses have prompted some to ask if computer-mediated communication (CMC) promotes, hinders, or has no effect on the amount and quality of critical thinking in a course (relative to face-to-face communication). There is some evidence to suggest a fourth, more nuanced possibility: that CMC may promote some aspects of critical thinking but hinder others. For example, Guiller et al. (2008)&lt;ref name="Guiller2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guiller|first1=Jane|last2=Durndell|first2=Alan|last3=Ross|first3=Anne|title=Peer interaction and critical thinking: Face-to-face or online discussion?|journal=Learning and Instruction|year=2008|volume=18|issue=2|pages=187–200|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, relative to face-to-face discourse, online discourse featured more justifications, while face-to-face discourse featured more instances of students expanding on what others had said. The increase in justifications may be due to the asynchronous nature of online discussions, while the increase in expanding comments may be due to the spontaneity of ‘real-time’ discussion. Newman et al. (1995)&lt;ref name="Newman1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Newman |first1 = D. R. |last2=Webb|first2=Brian|last3=Cochrane|first3=Clive|title = A content analysis method to measure critical thinking in face-to-face and computer-supported group learning|journal=Interpersonal Computing and Technology|year=1995|volume=3|issue=September 1993|pages=56–77|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x|pmid=18352969}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed similar differential effects. They found that while CMC boasted more important statements and linking of ideas, it lacked novelty. The authors suggest that this may be due to difficulties participating in a brainstorming-style activity in an asynchronous environment. Rather, the asynchrony may promote users to put forth “considered, thought out contributions.”

Researchers assessing critical thinking in online discussion forums often employ a technique called Content Analysis,&lt;ref name="Newman1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guiller2008" /&gt; where the text of online discourse (or the transcription of face-to-face discourse) is systematically coded for different kinds of statements relating to critical thinking. For example, a statement might be coded as “Discuss ambiguities to clear them up” or “Welcoming outside knowledge” as positive indicators of critical thinking. Conversely, statements reflecting poor critical thinking may be labeled as “Sticking to prejudice or assumptions” or “Squashing attempts to bring in outside knowledge.” The frequency of these codes in CMC and face-to-face discourse can be compared to draw conclusions about the quality of critical thinking.

Searching for evidence of critical thinking in discourse has roots in a definition of critical thinking put forth by Kuhn (1991),&lt;ref name="Kuhn1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|title=The skills of argument|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasizes the social nature of discussion and knowledge construction. There is limited research on the role of social experience in critical thinking development, but there is some evidence to suggest it is an important factor. For example, research has shown that 3- to 4-year-old children can discern, to some extent, the differential creditability&lt;ref name="Koenig2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=M A|last2=Harris|first2=P L|title=Preschoolers mistrust ignorant and inaccurate speakers|journal=Child Development|date=2005|volume=76|issue=6|pages=1261–77|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00849.x|pmid=16274439|citeseerx=10.1.1.501.253}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expertise&lt;ref name="Lutz2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lutz|first1=D J|last2=Keil|first2=F C|title=Early understanding of the division of cognitive labor|journal=Child Development|date=2002|volume=73|issue=4|pages=1073–84|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00458|pmid=12146734}}&lt;/ref&gt; of individuals. Further evidence for the impact of social experience on the development of critical thinking skills comes from work that found that 6- to 7-year-olds from China have similar levels of skepticism to 10- and 11-year-olds in the United States.&lt;ref name="Heyman2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyman|first1=G D|last2=Fu|first2=G|last3=Lee|first3=K|title=Evaluating claims peoplemake about themselves: The development of skepticism|journal=Child Development|year=2007|volume=78|issue=2|pages=367–75|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01003.x|pmid=17381778|pmc=2570105}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the development of critical thinking skills was solely due to maturation, it is unlikely we would see such dramatic differences across cultures.

'''Virtue''' ({{lang-la|[[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]]}}, {{lang-grc|ἀρετή}} "[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]") is [[morality|moral]] [[excellence]]. A virtue is a trait or quality that is deemed to be morally [[Good and evil|good]] and thus is [[Value (ethics)|valued]] as a foundation of [[principle]] and good moral being. Personal virtues are characteristics [[Value (personal and cultural)|valued]] as promoting collective and individual greatness. In other words, it is a behavior that shows high moral standards. Doing what is right and avoiding what is wrong. The opposite of virtue is [[vice]].

The four classic [[cardinal virtues]] in [[Christianity]] are [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[prudence]], [[courage]] (or fortitude), and [[justice]]. Christianity derives the three theological virtues of [[faith]], [[hope]] and [[love]] ([[Charity (practice)|charity]]) from 1 Corinthians 13. Together these make up the [[seven virtues]]. Buddhism's four [[brahmavihara]] ("Divine States") can be regarded as virtues in the European sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistethics.org/9/wetle021.html Jon Wetlesen, Did Santideva Destroy the Bodhisattva Path?

''Abhidhammattha Sangaha: A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma''. BPS Pariyatti Editions, 2000, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nitobe Inazō]]'s book ''[[Bushido: The Soul of Japan]]'', the Japanese [[Bushidō]] code is characterized by eight main virtues, including honesty, heroic courage, and righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Bushido: The Code of the Samurai | publisher=Sweetwater Pres | author=Nitobe Inazō | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The ancient Romans used the Latin word ''virtus'' (derived from ''vir'', their word for ''man'') to refer to all of the "excellent qualities of men, including physical strength, valorous conduct, and moral rectitude." The French words ''vertu'' and ''virtu'' came from this Latin root. In the 13th century, the word ''virtue'' was "borrowed into English".&lt;ref&gt;’’The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories’’.

===Platonic virtue===
The four classic [[cardinal virtues]] are:&lt;ref&gt;Stanley B. Cunningham (2002), Review of Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philosophy, Dialogue, Volume 21, Issue 01, March 1982, pp. 133–37&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]]: {{lang|grc|σωφροσύνη}} (''sōphrosynē'')
* [[prudence]]: {{lang|grc|φρόνησις}} (''phronēsis'')
* [[courage]]: {{lang|grc|ἀνδρεία}} (''andreia'')
* [[justice (virtue)|justice]]: {{lang|grc|δικαιοσύνη}} (''dikaiosynē'')

This enumeration is traced to Greek philosophy and was listed by [[Plato]] in addition to [[piety]]: {{lang|grc|ὁσιότης}} (hosiotēs), with the exception that wisdom replaced prudence as virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, D. J. (1991), [http://www.peterlang.de/download/datasheet/42753/datasheet_61504.pdf The virtue of prudence], P. Lang., in Studies in Moral Philosophy. Vol. 5 General Editor: John Kekes&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. (1988), The cardinal virtues and Plato's moral psychologym The Philosophical Quarterly, 38(151), pp. 186–200&lt;/ref&gt; consider either of the above four virtue combinations as mutually reducible and therefore not cardinal.

It is unclear whether multiple virtues were of later construct, and whether Plato subscribed to a unified view of virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, The Unity of the Virtues in the "Protagoras", The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 25, No. 3 (Mar., 1972), pages 415-458&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' and ''[[Meno]]'', for example, he states that the separate virtues cannot exist independently and offers as evidence the contradictions of acting with wisdom, yet in an unjust way; or acting with bravery (fortitude), yet without wisdom.

=== Aristotelian virtue ===
In his work ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] defined a virtue as a point between a deficiency and an excess of a trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aristotle |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/ethics/summary.html |title=Sparknotes.com |publisher=Sparknotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point of greatest virtue lies not in the exact middle, but at a [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] sometimes closer to one extreme than the other. However, the virtuous action is not simply the "mean" (mathematically speaking) between two opposite extremes.  As Aristotle says in the Nicomachean Ethics: "at the right times, about the right things, towards the right people, for the right end, and in the right way, is the intermediate and best condition, and this is proper to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |title=Nicomachean Ethics |publisher=Home.wlu.edu |accessdate=2014-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232937/http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |archive-date=2013-10-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not simply splitting the difference between two extremes.  For example, generosity is a virtue between the two extremes of miserliness and being profligate.  Further examples include: courage between cowardice and foolhardiness, and confidence between [[self-deprecation]] and vanity.  In Aristotle's sense, virtue is excellence at being human.

===Pyrrhonist virtue===
The [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] described Pyrrhonism as "a way of life that, in accordance with appearances, follows a certain rationale, where that rationale shows how it is possible to seem to live rightly ("rightly" being taken, not as referring only to virtue, but in a more ordinary sense) and tends to produce the disposition to [[epoche|suspend judgment]]...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Empiricus]] ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' Book I Chapter 8 Sections 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, by eschewing [[belief]]s (i.e., [[dogma]]s) one would live in accordance with virtue.

===Prudence and virtue===
[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], the Roman [[Stoicism|Stoic]], said that perfect [[prudence]] is indistinguishable from perfect virtue. Thus, in considering all consequences, a prudent person would act in the same way as a virtuous person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The same rationale was expressed by [[Plato]] in ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', when he wrote that people only act in ways that they perceive will bring them maximum good. It is the lack of wisdom that results in the making of a bad choice instead of a prudent one. In this way, wisdom is the central part of virtue. Plato realized that because virtue was synonymous with wisdom it could be taught, a possibility he had earlier discounted. He then added "correct belief" as an alternative to knowledge, proposing that knowledge is merely correct belief that has been thought through and "tethered".

===Roman virtues===
The term "virtue" itself is derived from the Latin [[Virtus (virtue)|"virtus"]] (the personification of which was the deity [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]]), and had connotations of [[masculinity|"manliness"]], [[honor|"honour"]], worthiness of deferential respect, and civic duty as both [[Cincinnatus|citizen and soldier]]. This virtue was but one of many virtues which Romans of good character were expected to exemplify and pass on through the generations, as part of the [[mos maiorum|Mos Maiorum]]; ancestral traditions which defined [[Romanitas|"Roman-ness"]]. Romans distinguished between the spheres of private and public life, and thus, virtues were also divided between those considered to be in the realm of private family life (as lived and taught by the [[paterfamilias]]), and those expected of an upstanding Roman [[Citizenship#Roman ideas|citizen]].

Most Roman concepts of virtue were also personified as a [[numina|numinous deity]]. The primary Roman virtues, both public and private, were:
* Abundantia: "Abundance, Plenty" The ideal of there being enough food and prosperity for all segments of society. A public virtue.
* [[Auctoritas]] – "spiritual authority" – the sense of one's social standing, built up through experience, Pietas, and Industria. This was considered to be essential for a magistrate's ability to enforce law and order.
* Comitas – "humour" – ease of manner, courtesy, openness, and friendliness.
* Constantia – "perseverance" – military stamina, as well as general mental and physical endurance in the face of hardship.
* [[Clementia]] – "mercy" – mildness and gentleness, and the ability to set aside previous transgressions.
* [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|Dignitas]] – "dignity" – a sense of self-worth, personal self-respect and self-esteem.
* [[Disciplina]] – "discipline" – considered essential to military excellence; also connotes adherence to the legal system, and upholding the duties of citizenship.
* [[Faith|Fides]] - "good faith" - mutual trust and [[quid pro quo|reciprocal dealing]]s in both government and commerce (public affairs), a breach meant legal and religious consequences.
* Firmitas – "tenacity" – strength of mind, and the ability to stick to one's purpose at hand without wavering.
* [[frugality|Frugalitas]] – "frugality" – economy and simplicity in lifestyle, want for what we must have and not what we need, regardless of one's material possessions, authority or wants one has, an individual always has a degree of honour. Frugality is to eschew what has no practical use if it is in disuse and if it comes at the expense of the other virtues.
* [[Gravitas]] – "gravity" – a sense of the importance of the matter at hand; responsibility, and being earnest.
* Honestas – "respectability" – the image and honor that one presents as a respectable member of society.
* [[Humanitas]] – "humanity" – refinement, civilization, learning, and generally being cultured.
* Industria – "industriousness" – hard work.
* Innocencia - "selfless" - [[Roman charity]], always give without expectation of recognition, always give while expecting no personal gain, [[incorruptibility]] is aversion towards placing all power and influence from public office to increase personal gain in order to enjoy our personal or public life and deprive our community of their health, dignity and our sense of morality, that is an affront to every Roman.
* Laetitia - "Joy, Gladness" - The celebration of thanksgiving, often of the resolution of crisis, a public virtue.
* [[Nobilitas]] - "Nobility" - Man of fine appearance, deserving of honor, highly esteemed social rank, and, or, nobility of birth, a public virtue.
* [[justice|Justitia]] – "justice" – sense of moral worth to an action; personified by the goddess [[Iustitia]], the Roman counterpart to the Greek [[Themis]].
* [[Pietas]] – "dutifulness" – more than religious piety; a respect for the natural order: socially, politically, and religiously. Includes ideas of patriotism, fulfillment of [[Cult (religious practice)|pious obligation to the gods]], and honoring other human beings, especially in terms of the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron and client relationship]], considered essential to an orderly society.
* [[Prudentia]] – "prudence" – foresight, wisdom, and personal discretion.
* Salubritas – "wholesomeness" – general health and cleanliness, personified in the deity [[Salus]].
* Severitas – "sternness" – self-control, considered to be tied directly to the virtue of gravitas.
* [[honesty|Veritas]] – "truthfulness" – honesty in dealing with others, personified by the goddess [[Veritas]]. Veritas, being the mother of [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]], was considered the root of all virtue; a person living an honest life was bound to be virtuous.
* [[Virtus (virtue)|Virtus]] – "manliness" – valor, excellence, courage, character, and worth. 'Vir' is Latin for "man".

===The Seven Heavenly Virtues===
In 410 CE, [[Prudentius|Aurelius Prudentius Clemens]] listed seven "heavenly virtues" in his book [[Psychomachia]] (Battle of Souls) which is an allegorical story of conflict between vices and virtues. The virtues depicted were:
*chastity
*temperance 
*charity
*diligence 
*patience 
*kindness
*humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prudentius Seven Heavenly Virtues |url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/values/prudentius_virtues.htm |website=Changing Minds |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Entertain strangers
*Visit the sick
*Be merciful to prisoners
*Do ill to no man, nor consent unto such
*Forgive as ye hope to be forgiven
*Redeem the captive

*Do not consent to any wrong
*Persevere not in wrath
*Shun excess in eating and drinking
*Be humble and kind
*Serve your liege lord faithfully
*Do not steal
*Do not perjure yourself, nor let others do so
*Envy, hatred and violence separate men from the Kingdom of God
*Defend the Church and promote her cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The origins of Chivalry |url=http://www.baronage.co.uk/chivalry/chival1a.html |website=Baronage |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious traditions ==

===Bahá'í faith===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], virtues are direct spiritual qualities that the human soul possesses, inherited from the world of God. The development and manifestation of these virtues is the theme of the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and are discussed in great detail as the underpinnings of a divinely-inspired society by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in such texts as ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Buddhism===
{{main|Buddhist ethics}}
Buddhist practice as outlined in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] can be regarded as a progressive list of virtues.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
# Right View - Realizing the [[Four Noble Truths]] (samyag-vyāyāma, sammā-vāyāma).
# Right Mindfulness - Mental ability to see things for what they are with clear consciousness (samyak-smṛti, sammā-sati).
# Right Concentration - Wholesome one-pointedness of mind (samyak-samādhi, sammā-samādhi).

Buddhism's four ''[[brahmavihara]]'' ("Divine States") can be more properly regarded as virtues in the European sense. They are:
# [[Metta]]/Maitri: loving-kindness towards all; the hope that a person will be well; loving kindness is the wish that all sentient beings, without any exception, be happy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s15.htm |title=Buddhist Studies for Secondary Students, Unit 6: The Four Immeasurables |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Karuṇā]]: compassion; the hope that a person's sufferings will diminish; compassion is the wish for all sentient beings to be free from suffering.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# [[Mudita]]: altruistic joy in the accomplishments of a person, oneself or other; sympathetic joy is the wholesome attitude of rejoicing in the happiness and virtues of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# Upekkha/[[Upeksa|Upeksha]]: equanimity, or learning to accept both loss and gain, [[praise]] and [[blame]], success and failure with detachment, equally, for oneself and for others. Equanimity means not to distinguish between friend, enemy or stranger, but to regard every sentient being as equal. It is a clear-minded tranquil state of mind - not being overpowered by delusions, mental dullness or agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |title=A View on Buddhism, The four immeasurables: Love, Compassion, Joy and Equanimity |access-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819075238/http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |archive-date=2006-08-19 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also the [[Paramitas]] ("perfections"), which are the culmination of having acquired certain virtues. In [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]'s [[Pali Canon|canonical]] [[Buddhavamsa]]&lt;ref&gt;Buddhavamsa, chapter 2. For an on-line reference to the Buddhavamsa's seminality in the Theravada notion of ''parami'', see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html Bodhi (2005).]&lt;br&gt;In terms of other examples in the [[Pali literature]], Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 454, [https://archive.is/20120629172506/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:2679.pali entry for "Pāramī,"] (retrieved 2007-06-24) cites [[Jataka]] i.73 and [[Dhammapada]] [[Atthakatha]] i.84. Bodhi (2005) also mentions Acariya [[Dhammapala]]'s treatise in the [[Cariyapitaka]]-[[Atthakatha]] and the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]] [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentary (''tika'')]].&lt;/ref&gt; there are Ten Perfections (''dasa pāramiyo''). In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, the [[Lotus Sutra]] (''Saddharmapundarika''), there are Six Perfections; while in the [[Dasabhumika Sutra|Ten Stages]] (''Dasabhumika'') Sutra, four more ''Paramitas'' are listed.

===Christianity===
[[File:Stiftskirche Niederhaslach Glasfenster (Kampf der Tugenden mit dem Laster).jpg|thumb|upright|Virtues fighting vices, stained glass window (14th century) in the [[Niederhaslach Church]]]]{{main|Christian ethics}}{{See also|Seven virtues|Evangelical counsels}}
In [[Christianity]], the [[three theological virtues]] are [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]] and [[Agape|love]], a list which comes from [[1 Corinthians 13]]:13 ({{lang|grc|νυνὶ δὲ μένει πίστις}} ''pistis'' (faith), {{lang|grc|ἐλπίς}} ''elpis'' (hope), {{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agape'' (love), {{lang|grc|τὰ τρία ταῦτα· μείζων δὲ τούτων ἡ ἀγάπη}}). The same chapter describes love as the greatest of the three, and further defines love as "patient, kind, not envious, boastful, arrogant, or rude." (The Christian virtue of love is sometimes called [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and at other times a Greek word [[agape]] is used to contrast the love of God and the love of humankind from other types of love such as friendship or physical affection.)

Christian scholars frequently add the four Greek [[cardinal virtues]] (prudence, justice, temperance, and courage) to the theological virtues to give the [[seven virtues]]; for example, these seven are the ones described in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', sections 1803–1829.

The Bible mentions additional virtues, such as in the "[[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]," found in Galatians 5:22-23: "By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit it is [[Temperance (virtue)|benevolent]]-love: joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, benevolence, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is absolutely no law against such a thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Aland]], [[Kurt Aland]], Matthew Black, [[Carlo M. Martini]], [[Bruce M. Metzger]] and [[Allen Wikgren]], ''The Greek New Testament'', 4th ed. (Federal Republic of Germany: United Bible Societies, 1993, c1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval and renaissance periods saw a number of models of sin listing the seven deadly sins and the virtues opposed to each.

===Daoism===
"Virtue", translated from Chinese ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' ([[Wikt:德|德]]), is also an important concept in [[Chinese philosophy]], particularly [[Daoism]]. ''De'' ({{zh|c=德|p=''dé''| w=''te''}}) originally meant normative "virtue" in the sense of "personal character; inner strength; integrity", but semantically changed to moral "virtue; kindness; morality". Note the semantic parallel for English ''[[Wikt:virtue|virtue]]'', with an archaic meaning of "inner potency; divine power" (as in "by virtue of") and a modern one of "moral excellence; goodness".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In early periods of [[Confucianism]], moral manifestations of "virtue" include ''ren'' ("[[Human nature|humanity]]"), ''xiao'' ("[[filial piety]]"), and ''li'' ("[[Li (Confucian)|proper behavior, performance of rituals]]"). The notion of [[Confucianism#Humaneness|ren]] - according to Simon Leys - means "humanity" and "goodness". [[Confucianism#Humaneness|Ren]] originally had the archaic meaning in the Confucian Book of Poems of "virility", but progressively took on shades of ethical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Yu-sheng: "The evolution of the pre-Confucian meaning of jen and the Confucian concept of moral autonomy," Monumenta Serica, vol.31, 1974-75&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider the virtues identified in early Confucianism as non-theistic philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"&gt;Yang, C. K. (1971), Religion in Chinese society: a study of contemporary social functions of religion and some of their historical factors, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-88133-621-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Daoist concept of ''De'', compared to Confucianism, is more subtle, pertaining to the "virtue" or ability that an individual realizes by following the [[Tao|Dao]] ("the Way"). One important normative value in much of Chinese thinking is that one's social status should result from the amount of virtue that one demonstrates, rather than from one's birth. In the ''[[Analects]]'', [[Confucius]] explains ''de'' as follows: "He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu Lunyu 2/1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005031/http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu |date=2007-09-27 }}, tr. [[James Legge]]&lt;/ref&gt; In later periods, particularly from the Tang dynasty period, Confucianism as practiced, absorbed and melded its own concepts of virtues with those from Daoism and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hindu ethics}}Virtue is a much debated&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Hindery (2004), Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions, {{ISBN|978-8120808669}}; pages 268-72;
* Quote: "(In Hinduism), srutis did not pretend to deal with all situations or irregularities in the moral life, leaving these matters to human reasons (Mbh Xii.109); Accordingly, that again which is virtue may, according to time and place, be sin (...); Under certain conditions, acts that are apparently evil (such as violence) can be permitted if they produce consequences that are good (protection of children and women in self-defense when the society is attacked in war)
* Quote: "(The Hindu scripture) notes the interrelationship of several virtues, consequentially. Anger springs from covetousness; (the vice of) envy disappears in consequence of (the virtues) of compassion and knowledge of self (Mbh Xii.163);&lt;/ref&gt; and an evolving concept in ancient scriptures of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S. Cromwell (1982), The evolution of Hindu ethical ideals, Asian Studies Program, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker and Becker (2001), Encyclopedia of Ethics, {{ISBN|978-0415936729}}, 2nd Edition, Routledge, pages 845-848&lt;/ref&gt; The essence, need and value of virtue is explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};
* Also see: Apastamba, Dharma Sutra, 1.20.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtues lead to ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: पुण्य,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=puNya&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 puNya] Spoken Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; holy living) in Hindu literature; while vices lead to ''pap'' (Sanskrit: पाप,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html search for pApa] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[sin]]). Sometimes, the word ''punya'' is used interchangeably with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;What Is Hinduism?, Himalayan Academy (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-934145-00-5}}, page 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtues that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' ([[forgiveness]]), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K. N. (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought: A Philosophical Study of Hindu, Jaina, and Buddhist Morals, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1608-4}}, pp 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; In later verses, this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] - considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong - argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S.

===Islam===
{{main|Islamic ethics|Thawab}}
In Islam, the [[Quran]] is believed to be the literal word of God, and the definitive description of virtue while [[Muhammad]] is considered an ideal example of virtue in human form. The foundation of Islamic understanding of virtue was the understanding and interpretation of the Quran and the practices of Muhammad. Its meaning has always been in context of active submission to God performed by the community in unison. The motive force is the notion that believers are to "[[Enjoining good and forbidding wrong|enjoin that which is virtuous and forbid that which is vicious]]" (''al-amr bi-l-maʿrūf wa-n-nahy ʿani-l-munkar'') in all spheres of life ({{Cite Quran|3|110|style=ref}}). Another key factor is the belief that mankind has been [[Fitra|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence. Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will. Muhammad's preaching produced a "radical change in [[moral value]]s based on the sanctions of the new religion and the present religion, and fear of God and of the Last Judgment". Later [[Muslim scholars]] expanded the religious ethics of the scriptures in immense detail.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Akhlaq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hadith]] (Islamic traditions), it is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an:
{{quote|"The Prophet Muhammad said, "Virtue is good manner, and sin is that which creates doubt and you do not like people to know it.""|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6195}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6196}}}}

Wabisah bin Ma’bad reported:
{{quote|“I went to Messenger of God and he asked me: “Have you come to inquire about virtue?” I replied in the affirmative. Then he said: “Ask your heart regarding it. Virtue is that which contents the soul and comforts the heart, and sin is that which causes doubts and perturbs the heart, even if people pronounce it lawful and give you verdicts on such matters again and again.”|Ahmad and Ad-Darmi}}

Virtue, as seen in opposition to sin, is termed ''thawāb'' (spiritual merit or reward) but there are other Islamic terms to describe virtue such as ''faḍl'' ("bounty"), ''taqwa'' ("piety") and ''ṣalāḥ'' ("righteousness"). For Muslims fulfilling the rights of others are valued as an important building block of Islam. According to Muslim beliefs, God will forgive individual sins but the bad treatment of people and injustice with others will only be pardoned by them and not by God.

===Jainism===
[[File:India, madhya pradesh, jina parshvanatha dalla tempèesta, 600-700.JPG|thumb|200px|upright|[[Parshwanatha]], the torch bearer of [[ahimsa]].]]
In [[Jainism]], attainment of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] is possible only if the seeker possesses certain virtues. All [[Jains]] are supposed to take up the five vows of [[ahimsa]] (non violence), [[satya]] (truthfulness), [[asteya]] (non stealing), [[aparigraha]] (non attachment) and [[brahmacharya]] (celibacy) before becoming a monk. These vows are laid down by the [[Tirthankaras]]. Other virtues which are supposed to be followed by both monks as well as laypersons include forgiveness, humility, self-restraint and straightforwardness. These vows assists the seeker to escape from the karmic bondages thereby escaping the cycle of birth and death to attain liberation.&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/bliss-of-wisdom/जैन-धर्म-के-पाँच-मूलभूत-सिद्धांत-bfc9b756d509&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{main|Jewish ethics}}Loving God and obeying his laws, in particular the [[Ten Commandments]], are central to Jewish conceptions of virtue. Wisdom is personified in the first eight chapters of the [[Book of Proverbs]] and is not only the source of virtue but is depicted as the first and best creation of God (Proverbs 8:12-31).

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule came from the first century [[Hillel the Elder|Rabbi Hillel the Elder]]. Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar, he is associated with the development of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] and, as such, one of the most important figures in [[Jewish history]]. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the most concise terms, Hillel replied (reputedly while standing on one leg): "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary; go and learn."&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], tractate Shabbat 31a. See also the [[ethic of reciprocity]] or "The [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samurai virtue==
In [[Hagakure]], Yamamoto Tsunetomo encapsulates his views on 'virtue' in the four vows he makes daily:&lt;ref&gt;''Hagakure: The Secret Wisdom of the Samurai'', by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, Translated by Alexander Bennett, Tuttle Publishing, 2014, {{ISBN|978-4-8053-1198-1}} (Full Translation)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Never to be outdone in the way of the samurai or [[bushido]].
# To be of good use to the master.
# To be filial to my parents.
# To manifest great compassion and act for the sake of Man.

Yamamoto goes on to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If one dedicates these four vows to the gods and Buddhas every morning, he will have the strength of two men and never slip backward. One must edge forward like the inchworm, bit by bit. The gods and Buddhas, too, first started with a vow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bushidō code is typified by seven virtues:&lt;ref&gt;see Random House's Japanese-English, English-Japanese Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rectitude (義,gi)
* Courage (勇,yuu)
* Benevolence (仁,jin)
* Respect (礼,rei)
* Honesty (誠,sei)
* Honor (誉,yo)
* Loyalty (忠,chuu)

Others that are sometimes added to these:
* Filial piety (孝,kō)
* Wisdom (智,chi)
* Care for the aged (悌,tei)

==Philosophers' views==
[[File:இலண்டன் திருவள்ளுவர்.JPG|thumb|right|Valluvar (Statue at SOAS, [[University of London]]).]]

===Valluvar===
While religious scriptures generally consider ''[[dharma]]'' or ''aṟam'' (the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] term for virtue) as a divine virtue, [[Valluvar]] describes it as a way of life rather than any spiritual observance, a way of harmonious living that leads to universal happiness.&lt;ref name="Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers"&gt;{{cite book |author= N. Sanjeevi |title= First All India Tirukkural Seminar Papers |url= |year= 1973 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of Madras | location=Chennai |isbn = |page= xxiii–xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Valluvar keeps ''aṟam'' as the cornerstone throughout the writing of the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]].&lt;ref name="UMI_WhyNationalBook?"&gt;{{cite book

Perhaps rephrase this to indicate that it's Valluvar's misconception, if in fact that is the case.|date=July 2019}} Valluvar positively suggested that a divine origin is not required to define the concept of justice.&lt;ref name="Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers"/&gt; In the words of [[V. R. Nedunchezhiyan]], justice according to Valluvar "dwells in the minds of those who have knowledge of the standard of right and wrong; so too deceit dwells in the minds which breed fraud."&lt;ref name="Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers"/&gt;

===René Descartes===
For the [[Rationalism|Rationalist]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Men should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid blessedness or pleasure. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that these goods contribute to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;Blom, John J., ''Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology''. New York University Press. 1978. {{ISBN|0-8147-0999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'', expresses true virtue as different from what commonly is known about this moral trait. In Kant's view, to be goodhearted, benevolent and sympathetic is not regarded as true virtue. The only aspect that makes a human truly virtuous is to behave in accordance with moral principles. Kant presents an example for more clarification; suppose that you come across a needy person in the street; if your [[sympathy]] leads you to help that person, your response does not illustrate your virtue. In this example, since you do not afford helping all needy ones, you have behaved unjustly, and it is out of the domain of principles and true virtue. Kant applies the approach of [[four temperaments]] to distinguish truly virtuous people. According to Kant, among all people with diverse temperaments, a person with [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] frame of mind is the most virtuous whose thoughts, words and deeds are one of principles.

=== Friedrich Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s view of virtue is based on the idea of an order of rank among people. For Nietzsche, the virtues of the strong are seen as vices by the weak and slavish, thus Nietzsche's virtue ethics is based on his distinction between [[master and slave morality|master morality and slave morality]]. Nietzsche promotes the virtues of those he calls "higher men", people like Goethe and Beethoven. The virtues he praises in them are their creative powers (“the men of great creativity” - “the really great men according to my understanding” (WP 957)).
According to Nietzsche these higher types are solitary, pursue a "unifying project", revere themselves and are healthy and life-affirming.&lt;ref name="Leiter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/#2 |last= Leiter |first=Brian |title=Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because mixing with the herd makes one base, the higher type “strives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great majority…” (BGE 26). The 'Higher type' also "instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities" (WP 944) in the form of an "organizing idea" for their life, which drives them to artistic and creative work and gives them psychological health and strength.&lt;ref name="Leiter"/&gt; The fact that the higher types are "healthy" for Nietzsche does not refer to physical health as much as a psychological resilience and fortitude. Finally, a Higher type affirms life because he is willing to accept the [[eternal return]] of his life and affirm this forever and unconditionally.

In the last section of ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche outlines his thoughts on the noble virtues and places [[solitude]] as one of the highest virtues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And to keep control over your four virtues: courage, insight, sympathy, solitude. Because solitude is a virtue for us, since it is a sublime inclination and impulse to cleanliness which shows that contact between people (“society”) inevitably makes things unclean. Somewhere, sometime, every
community makes people – “base.” (BGE §284)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche also sees truthfulness as a virtue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genuine honesty, assuming that this is our virtue and we cannot get rid of it, we free spirits – well then, we will want to work on it with all the love and malice at our disposal and not get tired of ‘perfecting’ ourselves in our virtue, the only one we have left: may its glory come to rest like a gilded, blue evening glow of mockery over this aging culture and its dull and dismal seriousness! ([[Beyond Good and Evil]], §227)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Benjamin Franklin ===
[[File:Seal of Virginia.svg|thumb|upright|Virtue, spear in hand, with her foot on the prostrate form of [[Tyranny]] on the [[Sic Semper Tyrannis|Great Seal of Virginia]]]]
These are the virtues&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftrain.com/franklin_improving_self.html Franklin's 13 Virtues] Extract of Franklin's autobiography, compiled by Paul Ford.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Benjamin Franklin]] used to develop what he called 'moral perfection'. He had a checklist in a notebook to measure each day how he lived up to his virtues.

They became known through [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's autobiography]].

# Temperance: Eat not to Dullness. Drink not to Elevation.
# Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling Conversation.
# [[Order (virtue)|Order]]: Let all your Things have their Places. Let each Part of your Business have its Time.
# Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
# Frugality: Make no Expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e. Waste nothing.
# Industry: Lose no Time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary Actions.
# Sincerity: Use no hurtful Deceit. Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
# Justice: Wrong none, by doing Injuries or omitting the Benefits that are your Duty.
# Moderation: Avoid Extremes. Forbear resenting Injuries so much as you think they deserve.
# Cleanliness: Tolerate no Uncleanness in Body, Clothes or Habitation.
# Tranquility: Be not disturbed at Trifles, or at Accidents common or unavoidable.
# Chastity: Rarely use [[wikt:venery#Etymology 2|Venery]] but for Health or Offspring; Never to Dullness, Weakness, or the Injury of your own or another's Peace or Reputation.
# Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

==Contemporary views==

===Virtues as emotions===
{{Also|Moral emotions}}

Marc Jackson in his book ''Emotion and Psyche'' puts forward a new development of the virtues. He identifies the virtues as what he calls the good emotions "The first group consisting of [[love]], [[kindness]], [[joy]], [[faith]], [[awe]] and [[pity]] is good"&lt;ref&gt;Marc Jackson (2010) ''Emotion and Psyche.'' O-books. p. 12 ({{ISBN|978-1-84694-378-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; These virtues differ from older accounts of the virtues because they are not character traits expressed by action, but emotions that are to be felt and developed by feeling not acting.

===In Objectivism===
[[Ayn Rand]] held that her morality, the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)#Ethics: rational self-interest|morality of reason]], contained a single axiom: existence exists, and a single choice: to live. All values and virtues proceed from these. To live, man must hold three fundamental values that one develops and achieves in life: Reason, Purpose, and Self-Esteem. A value is "that which one acts to gain and/or keep ... and the virtue[s] [are] the act[ions] by which one gains and/or keeps it." The primary virtue in [[Objectivist ethics]] is rationality, which as Rand meant it is "the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action."&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness|The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism]]'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; These values are achieved by passionate and consistent action and the virtues are the policies for achieving those fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Gotthelf|Gotthelf, Allan]] ''On Ayn Rand''; p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Ayn Rand describes seven virtues: rationality, productiveness, pride, independence, integrity, honesty and justice. The first three represent the three primary virtues that correspond to the three fundamental values, whereas the final four are derived from the virtue of rationality. She claims that virtue is not an end in itself, that virtue is not its own reward nor sacrificial fodder for the reward of evil, that life is the reward of virtue and happiness is the goal and the reward of life. Man has a single basic choice: to think or not, and that is the gauge of his virtue. Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality, not the degree of your intelligence but the full and relentless use of your mind, not the extent of your knowledge but the acceptance of reason as an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn (1961) ''For the New Intellectual Galt’s Speech,'' "[[For the New Intellectual|For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]", pp. 131, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern psychology===
[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]], two leading researchers in [[positive psychology]], recognizing the deficiency inherent in [[psychology]]'s tendency to focus on dysfunction rather than on what makes a healthy and stable [[personality]], set out to develop a list of "[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]".&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of study, 24 traits (classified into six broad areas of virtue) were identified, having "a surprising amount of similarity across cultures and strongly indicat[ing] a historical and cross-cultural convergence."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. p. 36. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; These six categories of virtue are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, transcendence, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. pp. 36-39. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists suggest that these virtues are adequately grouped into fewer categories; for example, the same 24 traits have been grouped into simply: Cognitive Strengths, Temperance Strengths, and Social Strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F. Krueger, Christopher S. Kallie. 2010. The structure of virtue: An empirical investigation of the dimensionality of
the virtues in action inventory of strengths. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice as opposite==
{{Main|Vice}}
{{See also|List of virtues}}
The opposite of a virtue is a [[vice]]. Vice is a habitual, repeated practice of wrongdoing. One way of organizing the vices is as the corruption of the virtues.

As [[Aristotle]] noted, however, the virtues can have several opposites. Virtues can be considered the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates ''in medio stat virtus'' - in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are opposites of courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; the opposites of pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more "modern" virtue, [[Toleration|tolerance]], can be considered the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness on the one hand and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as the opposites of virtues - but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different opposites, all distinct from each other.

'''Concepts''' are defined as abstract ideas or general notions that occur in the mind, in speech, or in thought. They are understood to be the fundamental building blocks of [[thought]]s and [[belief]]s. They play an important role in all aspects of [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of Laurence and Margolis' book called Concepts: Core Readings. {{ISBN|9780262631938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, S. (1991). Knowledge Acquisition: Enrichment or Conceptual Change? In S. Carey and R. Gelman (Eds.), ''The Epigenesis of Mind: Essays on Biology and Cognition'' (pp. 257-291). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, concepts are studied by several disciplines, such as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, and these disciplines are interested in the logical and psychological structure of concepts, and how they are put together to form thoughts and sentences. The study of concepts has served as an important flagship of an emerging interdisciplinary approach called cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;https://bcs.mit.edu/research/cognitive-science&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab at Stanford University|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Eric Margolis|author2=Stephen Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Concepts as [[mental representation]]s, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
* Concepts as [[skill|abilities]], where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Concepts as [[Fregean]] senses (see [[sense and reference]]), where concepts are [[abstract objects]], as opposed to mental objects and mental states

Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair".

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [[Hierarchy (thinking)|higher-level thinking]].]]

A concept is [[wikt:instantiate#Verb|instantiated (reified)]] by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [[idea]]s.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the [[cognitive science]] disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and, [[philosophy]], where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[databases]] and [[artificial intelligence]] where they are sometimes called [[class (set theory)|classes]], [[database schema|schema]] or [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. In [[wikt:informal#Adjective|informal]] use the word ''concept'' often just means any [[idea]].

&lt;br/&gt;

== Ontology of Concepts ==
A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what they ''are''. Philosophers construe this question as one about the [[ontology]] of concepts—what they are like. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|year=2007|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|journal=Nous|volume=41|issue=4|pages=561–593|citeseerx=10.1.1.188.9995|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the framework of the [[representational theory of mind]], the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called ''mental representations'' (colloquially understood as ''ideas in the mind''). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''[[propositional attitude]]s'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it "believing", "doubting", "wondering", "accepting", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Fodor]], ''Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Physicalist View of Concepts ====
{{See also|Physicalism}}In a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origin of Concepts|last=Carey|first=Susan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Big Book of Concepts|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|year=2002|isbn=978-0-262-13409-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"/&gt; The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]]. Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]]. The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts. ("Sort" is itself another word for concept, and "sorting" thus means to organise into concepts.)

=== Concepts as abstract objects ===
{{See also|Abstract and concrete}}

The semantic view of concepts suggests that concepts are [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] objects. In this view, concepts are abstract objects of a category out of a human's mind rather than some mental representations. &lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"/&gt; However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept "dog" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept—or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"/&gt; Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called "lexical concepts".&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"/&gt;

Study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt;

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word "moon" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

==== A priori concepts ====
{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] maintained the view that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction "a posteriori concepts" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

====Embodied content====
{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}

In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==== Realist universal concepts ====
{{Main page|Platonic realism}}
[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|year=1999|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|pages=3–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sense and reference ====
{{Main page|Sense and reference}}
[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status &lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;.

==== Concepts in calculus ====
According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
{{Main article|Definitionism}}

The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"/&gt; is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt;), and was prominently held until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"/&gt; Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"/&gt; An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"/&gt; Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt;

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"/&gt; In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]]—[[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"/&gt; Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Metaphysics|last=Mccarthy, Gabby.|date=2018|publisher=EDTECH|isbn=978-1-83947-365-4|oclc=1132386254}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Shoemaker's classic "[[Time Without Change]]" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt; it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt; summarized as follows:
*It seems that there simply are no definitions—especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt;
*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt;
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt;
*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt; See below.
*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt;

=== Prototype theory ===
{{Main article|Prototype theory}}

Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"/&gt; Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=978-0-12-497750-1|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership; a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"/&gt; It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; We can judge an item's membership of the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member—the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain. Some of these are: visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

The Prototype perspective is proposed as an alternative view to the Classical approach. While the Classical theory requires an all-or-nothing membership in a group, prototypes allow for more fuzzy boundaries and are characterized by attributes.&lt;ref name="prototype in linguistic theory"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/TAYLCP-3|title=Linguistic Categorization: Prototypes In Linguistic Theory|last=TAYLOR|first=John R.|date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakeoff stresses that experience and cognition are critical to the function of language, and Labov's experiment found that the function that an artifact contributed to what people categorized it as.&lt;ref name="prototype in linguistic theory"/&gt; For example, a container holding mashed potatoes versus tea swayed people toward classifying them as a bowl and a cup, respectively. This experiment also illuminated the optimal dimensions of what the prototype for "cup" is.&lt;ref name="prototype in linguistic theory"/&gt;

Prototypes also deal with the essence of things and to what extent they belong to a category. There have been a number of experiments dealing with questionnaires asking participants to rate something according to the extent to which it belongs to a category. &lt;ref name="prototype in linguistic theory"/&gt;This question is contradictory to the Classical Theory because something is either a member of a category or is not.&lt;ref name="prototype in linguistic theory"/&gt; This type of problem is paralleled in other areas of linguistics such as phonology, with an illogical question such as "is /i/ or /o/ a better vowel?" The Classical approach and Aristotelian categories may be a better descriptor in some cases.&lt;ref name="prototype in linguistic theory"/&gt;

=== Theory-theory ===
{{Main page|Theory-theory}}
Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"/&gt; Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.&lt;ref name="Big Book"/&gt; In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt; How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt; This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"/&gt; When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish.Theory-theory also postulates that people's theories about the world are what inform their conceptual knowledge of the world. Therefore, analysing people's theories can offer insights into their concepts. In this sense, "theory" means an individual's mental explanation rather than scientific fact. This theory criticizes classical and prototype theory as relying too much on similarities and using them as a sufficient constraint. It suggests that theories or mental understandings contribute more to what has membership to a group rather than weighted similarities, and a cohesive category is formed more by what makes sense to the perceiver. Weights assigned to features have shown to fluctuate and vary depending on context and experimental task demonstrated by Tversky. For this reason, similarities between members may be collateral rather than causal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Gregory L.|last2=Medin|first2=Douglas L.|date=1985|title=The role of theories in conceptual coherence.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=92|issue=3|pages=289–316|doi=10.1037//0033-295x.92.3.289|pmid=4023146|issn=0033-295X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

== Ideasthesia ==
{{Main|Ideasthesia}}
According to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or "sensing concepts"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. {{doi|10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question is also known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harnad (1995). Why and How We Are Not Zombies. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1: 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Chalmers (1995). Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2 (3): 200–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on [[synesthesia]] where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.'' 20(1–2): pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blouw, P., Solodkin, E., Thagard, P., &amp; Eliasmith, C. (2016). Concepts as semantic pointers: A framework and computational model. Cognitive Science, 40(5), 1128–1162. {{doi|10.1111/cogs.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "concept" is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''[[Wikt:conceptus|conceptum]]'' – "something conceived").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |title=Homework Help and Textbook Solutions &amp;#124; bartleby |accessdate=2011-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706200201/http://bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 }}The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Statement that apparently contradicts itself}}
[[File:LargeTribarGotschuchenAustria.JPG|thumb|This apparently impossible object, located in Gotschuchen,  Austria, projects into a [[Penrose triangle]]]]

A '''paradox''', also known as an [[antinomy]], is a logically self-contradictory statement or a statement that runs contrary to one's expectation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#paradox|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon — Paradox|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Paradox.html|title=Paradox|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to a seemingly self-contradictory or a logically unacceptable conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=paradox|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/paradox|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bolander|first1=Thomas|title=Self-Reference|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-reference/|accessdate=21 June 2016|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paradox usually involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements—that exist simultaneously and persist over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = W.

In [[logic]], many paradoxes exist which are known to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]] arguments, but which are nevertheless valuable in promoting [[critical thinking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eliason |first=James L. |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9604072434/using-paradoxes-teach-critical-thinking-science |title=Using Paradoxes to Teach Critical Thinking in Science |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=341–44 |date=March–April 1996 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions which were assumed to be rigorous, and have caused [[axioms]] of mathematics and logic to be re-examined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One example is [[Russell's paradox]], which questions whether a "list of all lists that do not contain themselves" would include itself, and showed that attempts to found [[set theory]] on the identification of sets with [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] were flawed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Irvine|first=Andrew David|title=Russell's Paradox|date=2016|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/russell-paradox/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-12-05|last2=Deutsch|first2=Harry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Crossley | first1=J.N. | last2=Ash | first2=C.J. | last3=Brickhill | first3=C.J. | last4=Stillwell | first4=J.C. | last5=Williams | first5=N.H. | title=What is mathematical logic? | zbl=0251.02001 | location=London-Oxford-New York | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1972 | isbn=0-19-888087-1 | pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Curry's paradox]], cannot be easily resolved by making foundational changes in a logical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shapiro|first=Lionel|title=Curry's Paradox|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/curry-paradox/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-12-05|last2=Beall|first2=Jc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples outside logic include the [[ship of Theseus]] from philosophy, a paradox which questions whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/theseus.html|title=Identity, Persistence, and the Ship of Theseus|website=faculty.washington.edu|access-date=2019-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, [[M.C. Escher]] featured [[Perspective (visual)|perspective-based]] paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aminotes.tumblr.com/post/653017235/the-mathematical-art-of-m-c-escher-for-me-it |title=The Mathematical Art of M.C. Escher |website=Lapidarium notes |editor-first=Amira |editor-last=Skomorowska |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, the word "paradox" often refers to statements that are [[irony|ironic]] or unexpected, such as "the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking".&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/paradox |title=Paradox |website=Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common themes in paradoxes include [[self-reference]], [[infinite regress]], [[circular definition]]s, and confusion or equivocation between different levels of [[abstraction]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Self-reference:An example is the statement "This statement is false", a form of the [[liar paradox]]. The statement is referring to itself. Another example of self-reference is the question of whether the [[barber]] shaves himself in the [[barber paradox]]. Yet another example involves the question "Is the answer to this question 'No'?"
;Contradiction:"This statement is false"; the statement cannot be false and true at the same time. Another example of contradiction is if a man talking to a genie wishes that wishes couldn't come true. This contradicts itself because if the genie grants his wish, he did not grant his wish, and if he refuses to grant his wish, then he did indeed grant his wish, therefore making it impossible either to grant or not grant his wish without leading to a contradiction.
;Vicious circularity, or infinite regress: "This statement is false"; if the statement is true, then the statement is false, thereby making the statement true. Another example of [[vicious circle|vicious circularity]] is the following group of statements:
:: "The following sentence is true."
:: "The previous sentence is false."

Other paradoxes involve [[false statement]]s ("'impossible' is not a word in my vocabulary", a simple paradox) or [[half-truths]] and the resulting [[cognitive bias|biased]] assumptions. This form is particularly common in [[Howler (error)|howlers]].

As an example, consider a situation in which a father and his son are driving down the road. The car crashes into a tree and the father is killed.  The boy is rushed to the nearest hospital where he is prepared for emergency [[surgery]]. Upon entering the surgery-suite, the surgeon says, "I can't operate on this boy. He's my son."

The apparent paradox is caused by a [[hasty generalization]], for if the surgeon is the boy's father, the statement cannot be true. On the other hand, the paradox is resolved if it is revealed that the surgeon is a woman — the boy's mother - or the parents were a gay couple.

Paradoxes which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringes of context or [[language]], and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradoxical quality. Paradoxes that arise from apparently intelligible uses of language are often of interest to [[logic]]ians and [[philosopher]]s. "This sentence is false" is an example of the well-known [[liar paradox]]: it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false, because if it is known to be false, then it can be inferred that it must be true, and if it is known to be true, then it can be inferred that it must be false. [[Russell's paradox]], which shows that the notion of ''the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all those sets that do not contain themselves'' leads to a contradiction, was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Thought-experiment]]s can also yield interesting paradoxes. The [[grandfather paradox]], for example, would arise if a [[time-travel]]er were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived, thereby preventing his own birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://brilliant.org/wiki/introduction-to-paradoxes/|title=Introduction to paradoxes {{!}} Brilliant Math &amp; Science Wiki|website=brilliant.org|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a specific example of the more general observation of the [[butterfly effect]], or that a time-traveller's interaction with the past—however slight—would entail making changes that would, in turn, change the future in which the time-travel was yet to occur, and would thus change the circumstances of the time-travel itself.

Often a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise. In the case of that apparent paradox of a time-traveler killing his own grandfather, it is the inconsistency of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip, but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to.

==Quine's classification&lt;!--Linked from 'Willard Van Orman Quine'--&gt;==
{{see also|Veridicality}}

[[W. V. Quine]] (1962) distinguished between three classes of paradoxes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Ways of Paradox, and other essays | last1 = Quine | first1 = W.V. | authorlink = W.V. Quine | year = 1966 | publisher = Random House | location = New York | chapter =  The ways of paradox |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YReOv31gdVIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22The+ways+of+paradox%22&amp;ots=LCqZ-lSnKY&amp;sig=aIzZYQ2Tw0rHnQwkUt0WcVHZWcQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20ways%20of%20paradox%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''veridical paradox'' produces a result that appears absurd, but is demonstrated to be true nonetheless. Thus the paradox of Frederic's birthday in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' establishes the surprising fact that a twenty-one-year-old would have had only five birthdays—if he had been born on a [[leap day]]. Likewise, [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] demonstrates difficulties in mapping voting results to the will of the people. One version of the [[Monty Hall paradox]] demonstrates that a decision which has an intuitive 50–50 chance is, in fact, heavily biased towards making a decision which, given the intuitive conclusion, the player would be unlikely to make. In 20th-century science, [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and [[Schrödinger's cat]] are famously vivid examples of a theory being taken to a logical but paradoxical end.
* A ''falsidical paradox'' establishes a result that not only ''appears'' false but actually ''is'' false, due to a fallacy in the demonstration. The various [[invalid proof|invalid mathematical proofs]] (e.g., that 1 = 2) are classic examples of this, often relying on a hidden [[division by zero]]. Another example is the inductive form of the [[All horses are the same colour|horse paradox]], which falsely generalises from true specific statements. [[Zeno's paradoxes]] are 'falsidical', concluding, for example, that a flying arrow never reaches its target or that a speedy runner cannot catch up to a tortoise with a small head-start.
* A paradox that is in neither class may be an ''[[antinomy]]'', which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning. For example, the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]] points out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of truth and description.

A fourth kind, which may be alternatively interpreted as a special case of the third kind, has sometimes been described since Quine's work:
* A paradox that is both true and false at the same time and in the same sense is called a ''[[dialetheia]]''.  In Western logics, it is often assumed, following [[Aristotle]], that no ''dialetheia'' exist, but they are sometimes accepted in Eastern traditions (e.g. in the [[Mohists]],&lt;ref name="SchoolOfNames"&gt;The [[School of Names|Logicians]] ([[Warring States period]]),[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-names/paradoxes.html "Miscellaneous paradoxes"] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gongsun Longzi]],&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Zen]]&lt;ref&gt;Chung-ying Cheng (1973) "[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Philosophical/OnZenLanguage.htm On Zen (Ch’an) Language and Zen Paradoxes]" ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'', '''V. 1''' (1973) pp. 77-102&lt;/ref&gt;) and in [[paraconsistent logic]]s. It would be mere equivocation or a matter of degree, for example, to both affirm and deny that "John is here" when John is halfway through the door, but it is self-contradictory simultaneously to affirm and deny the event.

==In philosophy==
A taste for paradox is central to the philosophies of [[Laozi]], [[Zeno of Elea]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Bhartrhari]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[G.K. Chesterton]], among many others. Søren Kierkegaard, for example, writes in the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow.  But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall.  This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |editor1-first=Howard V. |editor1-last=Hong |editor2-first=Edna H. |editor2-last=Hong |title=Philosophical Fragments |year=1844 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuMoXUAaEr0C&amp;pg=PA37 |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-date=1985 |isbn=9780691020365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In medicine==
A [[paradoxical reaction]] to a [[drug]] is the opposite of what one would expect, such as becoming agitated by a [[sedative]] or sedated by a [[stimulant]]. Some are common and are used regularly in medicine, such as the use of  stimulants such as [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]] in the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (also known as ADHD), while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected, such as severe agitation from a [[benzodiazepine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson MP, Pepper D, Currier GW, Holloman GH, Feifel D |title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup |journal=Western Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=26–34 |date=February 2012 |doi=10.5811/westjem.2011.9.6866 |doi-access=free |pmc=3298219 |pmid=22461918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
'''Axiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἀξία|ἀξία]]}}, ''axia'', "value, worth"; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[value (ethics)|value]]. It is either the collective term for [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to [[value theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]. The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapie|first=Paul|title=Logique de la volonté|url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_87792|year=1902|publisher=F. Alcan|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infotaste.com/axiology-and-aesthetics/|title=Axiology and aesthetics - article|website=www.infotaste.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eduard von Hartmann]], in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Hartmann|first=Eduard|title=Grundriss der Axiologie|year=1908|publisher=Hermann Haacke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel L. Hart. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105883 Axiology—Theory of Values]. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony." '''Formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[Robert S. Hartman]]'s [[science of value]].

==History==
Between the 5th and 6th centuries BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. [[Socrates]] believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. [[Socrates]]' student, [[Plato]] furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval period, [[Thomas Aquinas]] made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated70"&gt;Arneson, P. (2009). Axiology. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 70-74). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intuition''' is the ability to acquire [[knowledge]] without recourse to conscious [[reason]]ing.&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/intuition |accessdate= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different writers give the word "intuition" a great variety of different meanings, ranging from direct access to unconscious knowledge, unconscious cognition, inner sensing, inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition and the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.&lt;ref name="AurobindoDef"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=479–480|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;Intuition and consciousness – Rosenblatt AD, Thickstun JT. Psychoanal Q. 1994 Oct;63(4):696-714.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''intuition'' comes from the Latin verb ''intueri'' translated as "consider" or from the [[Late Middle Ages|late middle English]] word ''intuit'', "to contemplate".&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intuition |access-date= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Both [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] and [[Western philosophy|Western]] philosophers have studied the concept in great detail. [[Philosophy of mind]] deals with the concept.

===Eastern philosophy===
In the East intuition is mostly intertwined with [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], and various meanings exist from different religious texts.&lt;ref name="eastern"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leaman |first1=Oliver   |title=Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=FLuEAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2014 |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-415-17357-4 |pages=5–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism various attempts have been made to interpret the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and other esoteric texts.

For [[Sri Aurobindo]]  intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity; he describes the psychological plane in humans (often referred to as mana in [[sanskrit]]) having two arbitrary natures, the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information (mind seeking to become aware of external world). The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry &amp; aware of other emotions. He terms this second nature as knowledge by identity.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=68|ps=}}
He finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relations with the outer material world. As a result, when we seek to know about the external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truths about things via what our senses convey to us.  However,  knowledge by identity, which we currently only give the awareness of human beings' existence, can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|pp=69-71|ps=}}

He finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ([[Vedic]]) and later was taken over by [[reason]] which currently organises our perception, thoughts and actions resulting from Vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. He finds that this process, which seems to be decent, is actually a circle of progress, as a lower faculty is being pushed to take up as much from a higher way of working.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=75|ps=}} He finds when self-awareness in the mind is applied to one's self and the outer (other) -self, results in luminous self-manifesting identity; the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=72|ps=}}&lt;ref name="Integral yoga"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=799–800|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}

[[Rajneesh|Osho]] believed consciousness of human beings to be in increasing order from basic animal [[instinct]]s to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity. He also suggests living in the state of intuition is one of the ultimate aims of humanity.&lt;ref name="osho"&gt;{{cite book |last1= osho |first1=  Bhagwan  |title=Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zyBfk5V5HRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=osho+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y8maVNOMEInzPJHLgbgN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=10–20|publisher=osho international foundation |location=New York |isbn= 0-312-27567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advaita]] vedanta (a school of thought) takes intuition to be an experience through which one can come in contact with an experience [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="advaita"&gt;{{cite book |last1= M. Indich |first1=  William   |title=Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7ykZjWOiBMoC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=advaitha+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=49CaVPG_HIHlOJOygfAP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=advaitha%20on%20intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=8–10|publisher=Motilal banarisdas |location=varanasi |isbn= 81-208-1251-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
Buddhism finds intuition to be a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond the mental process of conscious [[thinking]], as the conscious thought cannot necessarily access subconscious information, or render such information into a communicable form.&lt;ref name="Sumedho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhismnow.com/2013/08/07/buddha-by-ajahn-sumedho/|title=Buddha, by  Ajahn Sumedho|work=Buddhism now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zen Buddhism]] various techniques have been developed to help develop one's intuitive capability, such as [[koans]] – the resolving of which leads to states of minor enlightenment ([[satori]]). In parts of Zen Buddhism intuition is deemed a mental state between the Universal mind and one's individual, discriminating mind.&lt;ref name="Bdictionary"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Humphreys |first1= Christmas |title=A Popular Dictionary of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TlWRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT406&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=enmZVNyjLs32O8vlgdAM&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-203-98616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zen Buddhism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Conners |first1=  Shawn  |title=Zen Buddhism – The Path to Enlightenment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVPUsSW-by0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iXeZVLu3LsjDOZjFgfgD&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |page=81|publisher=El paso trust |location=Texas |isbn= 1-934255-97-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
In Islam there are various scholars with varied interpretations of intuition (often termed as hadas ([[Arabic]]: حدس), hitting correctly on a mark), sometimes relating the ability of having intuitive knowledge to [[prophet]]hood. 
[[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Siháb al Din-al Suhrawadi]], in his book ''Philosophy Of Illumination'' (ishraq), finds that intuition is knowledge acquired through illumination, is mystical in nature, and also suggests mystical contemplation ([[mushahada]]) to bring about correct judgment.&lt;ref name="Islam1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawson |first1=  Todd  |title=Reason and Inspiration in Islam: Theology, Philosophy and Mysticism in Muslim Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq9zSbNr8gIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=210–225|publisher=I.B touris co ltd |location=London |isbn=1-85043-470-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Sīnā]] finds the ability of having intuition as a "prophetic capacity" and describes it as knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it. He finds that regular knowledge is based on imitation while intuitive knowledge is based on intellectual certitude.&lt;ref name="Islam2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kalin |first1=  Ibrahim  |title=Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosophy: Mulla Sadra on Existence, Intellect, and Intuition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6EGwDLio0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=155–160|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===
In the West, intuition does not appear as a separate field of study, and early mentions and definitions can be traced back to [[Plato]]. In his book ''[[Plato Republic|Republic]]'' he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human [[reason]] to comprehend the true nature of [[reality]].&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite web |title=Plato: Education and the Value of Justice |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2h.htm |accessdate= |last = Kemerling|first = Garth|date = 12 November 2011|website = Philosophy Pages }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the "soul of eternity", and a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge. He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity. This concept by Plato is also sometimes referred to as [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. The study was later continued by his [[Neo-platonism|followers]].&lt;ref name="Meno"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1= Jacob |title=A Commentary on Plato's Meno|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Commentary_on_Plato_s_Meno.html?id=HXI2lcrSsxIC&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=22 December 2014 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-43959-3 |pages=103–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[René Descartes|Descartes]] refers to an “intuition” as a pre-existing knowledge gained through rational reasoning or discovering truth through contemplation. This definition is commonly referred to as [[logical intuition|rational intuition]].&lt;ref name="Descartes"&gt;{{cite book |last1= L. Mursell |first1=James |title=The Philosophical Review  |series=4 |volume=28 |publisher= Duke University Press |location=USA |pages=391–401 |chapter=The Function of Intuition in Descartes' Philosophy of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later philosophers, such as [[David Hume|Hume]], have more ambiguous interpretations of intuition. Hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships (relation of time, place, and causation) while he states that "the resemblance" (recognition of relations) "will strike the eye" (which would not require further examination) but goes on to state, "or rather in mind"—attributing intuition to power of mind, contradicting the theory of [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="hume"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hume|first1=David |title=A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RIusIRd2q8C|accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press  |isbn= 9781775410676|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  A. Johnson|first1= Oliver|title=The Mind of David Hume: A Companion to Book I of A Treatise of Human Nature |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=fMjhcXhrv48C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=david+hume+on+intuition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDorBgwuhQ&amp;sig=4X0cOWxYQunqi8k_8rb5R5W8lbA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ai-ZVJy8HcWHPbeQgYAB&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press |isbn= 0-252-02156-8|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]]’s notion of “intuition” differs considerably from the Cartesian notion, and consists of the basic sensory information provided by the [[cognitive]] faculty of sensibility (equivalent to what might loosely be called [[perception]]). Kant held that our [[mind]] casts all of our external intuitions in the form of [[space]], and all of our internal intuitions ([[memory]], thought) in the form of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url= https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=5144&amp;pageno=35|title= Critique of Pure Reason|publisher= gutenberg.org|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intuitionism]] is a position advanced by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] in [[philosophy of mathematics]] derived from Kant's claim that all [[mathematics|mathematical knowledge]] is knowledge of the pure forms of the intuition—that is, intuition that is not empirical. [[Intuitionistic logic]] was devised by [[Arend Heyting]] to accommodate this position (and has been adopted by other forms of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] in general). It is characterized by rejecting the [[law of excluded middle]]: as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as [[double negation elimination]] and the use of [[reductio ad absurdum]] to prove the existence of something.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Intuitions are customarily appealed to independently of any particular theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims, and there are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch "Trusting Intuitions", in P. Greenough and M. Lynch (ed) ''Truth and Realism'', pp. 227–238.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years a number of philosophers, especially [[George Bealer]] have tried to defend appeals to intuition against [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quinean]] doubts about [[conceptual analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Bealer "Intuition and The Autonomy of Philosophy" in M. Depaul and W. Ramsey (eds) ''Rethinking Intuition: The Psychology of Intuition and Its Role In Philosophical Inquiry'' 1998, pp. 201–239.&lt;/ref&gt; A different challenge to appeals to intuition has recently come from [[experimental philosophy|experimental philosophers]], who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[metaphilosophy|metaphilosophical]] assumption that philosophy ought to depend on intuitions has recently been challenged by experimental philosophers (e.g., Stephen Stich).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MALLON|first=RON|last2=MACHERY|first2=EDOUARD|last3=NICHOLS|first3=SHAUN|last4=STICH|first4=STEPHEN|date=September 2009|title=Against Arguments from Reference|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00281.x|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=79|issue=2|pages=332–356|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00281.x|issn=0031-8205}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main problems adduced by experimental philosophers is that intuitions differ, for instance, from one culture to another, and so it seems problematic to cite them as evidence for a philosophical claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Weinberg|first=Jonathan M.|title=Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions|date=2012-08-13|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199733477.003.0008|work=Collected Papers, Volume 2|pages=159–190|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973347-7|access-date=2020-04-01|last2=Nichols|first2=Shaun|last3=Stich|first3=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Williamson]] has responded to such objections against philosophical methodology by arguing that intuition plays no special role in philosophy practice, and that skepticism about intuition cannot be meaningfully separated from a general [[skepticism]] about judgment. On this view, there are no qualitative differences between the methods of philosophy and common sense, the sciences or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Timothy (2008) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false The Philosophy of Philosophy]"&lt;/ref&gt; Others like Ernest Sosa seek to support intuition by arguing that the objections against intuition merely highlight a verbal disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sosa|first=Ernest|title=A Defense of the Use of Intuitions in Philosophy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781444308709.ch6|work=Stich|pages=101–112|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4443-0870-9|access-date=2020-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

===Freud===
According to Sigmund [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition, and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject.&lt;ref name="Freud"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  Walker Punerr|first1= Helen |title=Sigmund Freud: His Life and Mind |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=386tCTzeb28C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=intuition+sigmund+freud&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1DqgVLCrJcvfPYeWgLAK&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 December 2014  |publisher=Transaction Publishers |pages=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung===
In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of the [[Human ego|ego]], described in 1916 in ''[[Psychological Types]]'', intuition is an "irrational function", opposed most directly by sensation, and opposed less strongly by the "rational functions" of thinking and feeling. Jung defined intuition as "perception via the unconscious": using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.&lt;ref name=ptypes /&gt;

Jung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant, an "intuitive type", acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extraverted intuitive type, "the natural champion of all minorities with a future", orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extraverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining—even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others—a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit.&lt;ref name=ptypes&gt;C.G. Jung. ''Psychological Types''. Bollingen Series XX, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern psychology===
In more-recent psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and [[decision making]]. For example, the [[recognition primed decision]] (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. [[Gary A. Klein|Gary Klein]] found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. Thus, the RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The [[analysis]] is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Gary. ''Intuition At Work''. Random House, NY, NY. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Instinct]] is often misinterpreted as intuition and its reliability considered to be dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experiences with children will tend to have a better instinct about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sadler-Smith. Inside Intuition. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying [[nonverbal communication]], researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, J Daood, MC Giannini, R Boniface, PG Rhodes. Intellect versus intuition--dichotomy in the reception of nonverbal communication. Journal of General Psychology. 99:19-24, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In employing a similar design, they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non-intuitive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, ME Barringer, MC Giannini, RH Loiselle. Lack of relationship between handedness and intuitive and intellectual (rationalistic) modes of information processing. Journal of General Psychology. 111:31-37 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the works of Daniel Kahneman, intuition is the ability to automatically generate solutions without long logical arguments or evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Colloquial usage==
Intuition, as a gut feeling based on experience, has been found to be useful for business leaders for making judgement about people, culture and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=gcm_pubs|title=Australian Elite Leaders, Intuition and Effectiveness |publisher=epubs.scu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officers often claim to observe suspects and immediately "know" that they possess a weapon or illicit narcotic substances, which could also be action of [[instinct]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/concept-creep/477939/|title=Why Americans Are So Sensitive to Harm|first=Conor|last=Friedersdorf|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often unable to articulate why they reacted or what prompted them at the time of the event, they sometimes retrospectively can plot their actions based upon what had been clear and present danger signals. Such examples liken intuition to "[[Feeling#Gut|gut feelings]]" and when viable illustrate [[preconscious]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pinizzotto, PhD, Edward F. Davis, MA, and Charles E. Miller III [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Emotional%2Frational+decision+making+in+law+enforcement-a0114370262 Emotional/rational decision making in law enforcement] (Federal Bureau of Investigation), ''Free Online Library'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theory of Forms''' or '''theory of Ideas'''&lt;ref&gt;Modern English textbooks and translations prefer "theory of Form" to "theory of Ideas", but the latter has a long and respect tradition starting with Cicero and continuing in German philosophy until present, and some English philosophers prefer this in English too.  See W. D. Ross, Plato's ''Theory of Ideas'' (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This quote has to be checked including the erroneous volume no. (there are only 2), the missing page number, and the uppercase "theory"--&gt; The name of this aspect of Plato's thought is not modern and has not been extracted from certain dialogues by modern scholars. However, it is attributed to Plato without any direct textual evidence that Plato himself holds the views of the speakers of the dialogues. The term was used at least as early as [[Diogenes Laërtius]], who called it (Plato's) "Theory of Ideas:" {{lang|grc|Πλάτων ἐν τῇ περὶ τῶν ἰδεῶν ὑπολήψει}}..., {{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Lives of Eminent Philosophers|volume=Book III|page=Paragraph 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato uses many different words for what is traditionally called ''form'' in English translations and ''idea'' in German and Latin translations (Cicero). These include ''idéa'', ''morphē'', ''eîdos'', and ''parádeigma'', but also ''génos'', ''phýsis'', and ''[[Ousia|ousía]]''. He also uses expressions such as ''to x auto'', "the x itself" or ''kath' auto'' "in itself". See Christian Schäfer: ''Idee/Form/Gestalt/Wesen'', in ''Platon-Lexikon'', Darmstadt 2007, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[philosophical theory]], concept, or world-view, attributed to [[Plato]], that the physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Forms (usually given a capital F) were properties or essences of things, treated as non-material abstract, but substantial, entities. They were eternal, changeless, supremely real, and independent of ordinary objects that had their being and properties by 'participating' in them.''&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, ideas in this sense, often capitalized and translated as "Ideas" or "Forms",&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 28: Form" of ''The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World'' (Vol. II). Encyclopædia Britannica (1952), p. 526–542. This source states that ''Form'' or ''Idea'' get capitalized according to this convention when they refer "to that which is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas in our mind."&lt;/ref&gt; are the non-physical [[Ousia|essence]]s of all things, of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely imitations. Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily [[Socrates]]) of his [[Plato's dialogues|dialogues]] who sometimes suggests that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide [[knowledge]]. The theory itself is contested from within Plato's dialogues, and it is a general point of controversy in philosophy. Whether the theory represents Plato's own views is held in doubt by modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Watt|first=Stephen|year=1997|title=Plato: Republic|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|pages=xiv–xvi|isbn=1-85326-483-0|chapter=Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5-7)|place=London|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/republic0000plat|url=https://archive.org/details/republic0000plat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless the theory is considered to be a classical solution to the [[problem of universals]].

The early Greek concept of form precedes attested philosophical usage and is represented by a number of words mainly having to do with vision, sight, and appearance. Plato uses these aspects of sight and appearance from the early Greek concept of the form in his dialogues to explain the Forms and [[Form of the Good|the Good]].

==Forms&lt;!--linked from 'Third man argument'--&gt;==
The meaning of the term {{lang|grc|εἶδος}} (''eidos''), "visible form", and related terms μορφή (''morphē''), "shape",&lt;ref&gt;Possibly cognate with Sanskrit ''bráhman''. See Thieme (1952): ''Bráhman'', ZDMG, vol. 102, p. 128.{{cite web | title=ZDMG online | url=http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/titleinfo/93820}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and φαινόμενα (''phainomena''), "appearances", from φαίνω (''phainō''), "shine", [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰeh₂-|''*bʰeh₂-'']]'' or ''*bhā-''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=*bhā- | work=American Heritage Dictionary: Fourth Edition: Appendix I | year=2000 | url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE36.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; remained stable over the centuries until the beginning of philosophy, when they became equivocal, acquiring additional specialized philosophic meanings. Plato used the terms eidos and ideas interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morabito|first=Joseph|title=Designing Knowledge Organizations: A Pathway to Innovation Leadership|last2=Sack|first2=Ira|last3=Bhate|first3=Anilkumar|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2018|isbn=9781118905845|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]], starting with [[Thales]], noted that appearances change, and began to ask what the thing that changes "really" is. The answer was [[Substance theory|substance]], which stands under the changes and is the actually existing thing being seen. The status of appearances now came into question. What is the form really and how is that related to substance?

The Forms are expounded upon in Plato's dialogues and general speech, in that every object or quality in reality has a form: dogs, human beings, mountains, colors, courage, love, and goodness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baofu|first=Peter|title=Beyond Ethics to PostEthics: A Preface to a New Theory of Morality and Immorality|publisher=IAP|year=2011|isbn=978-1-61735-311-6|location=Charlotte, NC|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Form answers the question, "What is that?" Plato was going a step further and asking what Form itself is. He supposed that the object was essentially or "really" the Form and that the phenomena were mere shadows mimicking the Form; that is, momentary portrayals of the Form under different circumstances. [[The problem of universals]] – how can one thing in general be many things in particular – was solved by presuming that Form was a distinct singular thing but caused plural representations of itself in particular objects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, in the dialogue [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]], Socrates states: "Nor, again, if a person were to show that all is one by partaking of one, and at the same time many by partaking of many, would that be very astonishing. But if he were to show me that the absolute one was many, or the absolute many one, I should be truly amazed."&lt;ref name="Parmenides"&gt;{{cite book | title=Parmenides | title-link=Parmenides (dialogue) }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p129}} Matter is considered particular in itself. For Plato, forms, such as beauty, are more real than any objects that imitate them. Though the forms are timeless and unchanging, physical things are in a constant change of existence. Where forms are unqualified perfection, physical things are qualified and conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D. (2006), The Intellectual Devotional, p27, Borders Group, Inc, Ann Arbor, {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These Forms are the essences of various objects: they are that without which a thing would not be the kind of thing it is. For example, there are countless tables in the world but the Form of tableness is at the core; it is the essence of all of them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' 389: "For neither does every smith, although he may be making the same instrument for the same purpose, make them all of the same iron. The form must be the same, but the material may vary ...."&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Socrates held that the world of Forms is transcendent to our own world (the world of substances) and also is the essential basis of reality. Super-ordinate to matter, Forms are the most pure of all things. Furthermore, he believed that true knowledge/intelligence is the ability to grasp the world of Forms with one's mind.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' 185d–e: "...the mind in itself is its own instrument for contemplating the common terms that apply to everything." "Common terms" here refers to ''existence, non-existence, likeness, unlikeness, sameness, difference, unity'' and ''number''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Form is ''aspatial'' (transcendent to space) and ''atemporal'' (transcendent to time).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mammino|first=Liliana|title=Advances in Quantum Systems in Chemistry, Physics, and Biology: Selected Proceedings of QSCP-XXIII (Kruger Park, South Africa, September 2018)|last2=Ceresoli|first2=Davide|last3=Maruani|first3=Jean|last4=Brändas|first4=Erkki|publisher=Springer Nature|year=2020|isbn=978-3-030-34940-0|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of Plato, atemporal means that it does not exist within any time period, rather it provides the formal basis for time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It therefore formally grounds beginning, persisting and ending. It is neither eternal in the sense of existing forever, nor mortal, of limited duration. It exists transcendent to time altogether.&lt;ref&gt;The creation of the universe is the creation of time: "For there were no days and nights and months and years ... but when he (God) constructed the heaven he created them also." – ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', paragraph 37. For the creation God used "the pattern of the unchangeable," which is "that which is eternal." – paragraph 29. Therefore "eternal" – ''to aïdion'', "the everlasting" – as applied to Form means atemporal.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms are aspatial in that they have no spatial dimensions, and thus no orientation in space, nor do they even (like the point) have a location.&lt;ref&gt;Space answers to matter, the place-holder of form: "... and there is a third nature (besides Form and form), which is space (chōros), and is eternal (aei "always", certainly not atemporal), and admits not of destruction and provides a home for all created things ... we say of all existence that it must of necessity be in some place and occupy space ...." – ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', paragraph 52. Some readers will have long since remembered that in Aristotle time and space are accidental forms. Plato does not make this distinction and concerns himself mainly with essential form. In Plato, if time and space were admitted to be form, time would be atemporal and space aspatial.&lt;/ref&gt; They are non-physical, but they are not in the mind. Forms are extra-mental (i.e. real in the strictest sense of the word).&lt;ref&gt;These terms produced with the English prefix a- are not ancient. For the usage refer to {{cite web | title=a- (2) | work=Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=a- }} They are however customary terms of modern metaphysics; for example, see {{cite book | first=Martha C. | last=Beck | title=Plato's Self-Corrective Development of the Concepts of Soul, Form and Immortality in Three Arguments of the Phaedo | publisher=Edwin Mellon Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-7734-7950-3 | page=148 }} and see {{cite book | first=Dr. Katherine | last=Hawley | title=How Things Persist | year=2001 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-924913-X | nopp=true | page=Chapter 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Form is an objective "blueprint" of perfection.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 28: "The work of the creator, whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his work after an unchangeable pattern, must necessarily be made fair and perfect ...."&lt;/ref&gt; The Forms are perfect and unchanging representations of objects and qualities. For example, the Form of beauty or the Form of a triangle. For the form of a triangle say there is a triangle drawn on a blackboard. A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides. The triangle as it is on the blackboard is far from perfect. However, it is only the intelligibility of the Form "triangle" that allows us to know the drawing on the chalkboard is a triangle, and the Form "triangle" is perfect and unchanging. It is exactly the same whenever anyone chooses to consider it; however, time only effects the observer and not of the triangle. It follows that the same attributes would exist for the Form of beauty and for all Forms.

=== Etymology ===
The words, εἶδος (''eidos'') and ἰδέα (''idea'') come from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root [[Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/weyd-|''*weyd-'']] or ''*weid-'' "see" (cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''vétti''). ''Eidos'' (though not ''idea'') is already attested in texts of the [[Homer]]ic era, the earliest Greek literature. This transliteration and the translation tradition of German and Latin lead to the expression "theory of Ideas." The word is however not the English "idea," which is a mental concept only.

The [[Matter (philosophy)|theory of matter]] and form (today's [[hylomorphism]]) started with Plato and possibly germinal in some of the presocratic writings. The forms were considered as being "in" something else, which Plato called nature (''physis''). The latter seemed as carved "wood", ὕλη (''hyle'') in [[Greek language|Greek]], corresponding to ''materia'' in [[Latin]], from which the English word "[[Matter (philosophy)|matter]]" is derived, shaped by receiving (or exchanging) forms.

===Terminology===
[[File:Allegory of the Cave blank.png|thumb|In the [[Allegory of the Cave]], the objects that are seen are not real, according to Plato, but literally mimic the real Forms.]]
The English word "form" may be used to translate two distinct concepts that concerned Plato—the outward "form" or appearance of something, and "Form" in a new, technical nature, that never&lt;blockquote&gt;...assumes a form  like that of any of the things which enter into her; ... But the forms which enter into and go out of her are the likenesses  of real existences modelled after their patterns in a wonderful and inexplicable manner....&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aLnWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA470 Plato's ''Republic'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The objects that are seen, according to [[Plato]], are not real, but literally ''mimic'' the real Forms. In the [[Allegory of the Cave]] expressed in ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', the things that are ordinarily perceived in the world are characterized as shadows of the real things, which are not perceived directly. That which the observer understands when he views the world mimics the [[archetype]]s of the many [[type (metaphysics)|types]] and [[property (metaphysics)|properties]] (that is, of [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]]) of things observed.

===Intelligible realm and separation of the Forms===
Plato often invokes, particularly in his dialogues ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''Republic'' and ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', poetic language to illustrate the mode in which the Forms are said to exist. Near the end of the ''Phaedo'', for example, Plato describes the world of Forms as a pristine region of the physical universe located above the surface of the Earth (''Phd.'' 109a-111c). In the ''Phaedrus'' the Forms are in a "place beyond heaven" (''huperouranios topos'') (''Phdr.'' 247c ff); and in the ''Republic'' the sensible world is contrasted with the intelligible realm (''noēton topon'') in the famous Allegory of the Cave.

It would be a mistake to take Plato's imagery as positing the intelligible world as a literal physical space apart from this one.&lt;ref&gt;"No sensible man would insist that these things are as I have described them..." (''Phd.'' 114d).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"there is no Platonic 'elsewhere', similar to the Christian 'elsewhere'." ([[Iris Murdoch]], "Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals" (London, Chatto &amp; Windus 1992)  399).&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato emphasizes that the Forms are not beings that extend in space (or time), but subsist apart from any physical space whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/#3 Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we read in the ''Symposium'' of the Form of Beauty: "It is not anywhere in another thing, as in an animal, or in earth, or in heaven, or in anything else, but itself by itself with itself," (211b). And in the ''Timaeus'' Plato writes: "Since these things are so, we must agree that that which keeps its own form unchangingly, which has not been brought into being and is not destroyed, which neither receives into itself anything else from anywhere else, ''nor itself enters into anything anywhere'', is one thing," (52a, emphasis added).

===Ideal state===
{{original research|date=February 2016}}
According to Plato, Socrates postulated a world of ideal Forms, which he admitted were impossible to know. Nevertheless, he formulated a very specific description of that world, which did not match his metaphysical principles. Corresponding to the world of Forms is our world, that of the shadows, an imitation of the real one.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the Analogy of the Cave, Rep. 514a–520a.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as shadows exist only because of the light of a fire, our world exists as, "the offspring of the good".&lt;ref&gt;Republic, 508b trans. Grube&lt;/ref&gt; Our world is modeled after the patterns of the Forms. The function of humans in our world is therefore to imitate the ideal world as much as possible which, importantly, includes imitating the good, i.e. acting morally.

Plato lays out much of this theory in the "Republic" where, in an  attempt to define Justice, he considers many topics including the constitution of the ideal state. While this state, and the Forms, do not exist on earth, because their imitations do, Plato says we are able to form certain well-founded opinions about them, through a theory called recollection.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Phaedo, Meno, Phaedrus&lt;/ref&gt;

The republic is a greater imitation of Justice:&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our aim in founding the state was not the disproportional happiness of any one class,&lt;ref&gt;The word is ''ethnos'', "people". For the full range of meanings consult the [[American Heritage Dictionary]] online under [http://www.bartleby.com/61/88/E0228800.html ethnic].&lt;/ref&gt; but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a state ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The key to not know how such a state might come into existence is the word "founding" (''oikidzomen''), which is used of colonization.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} It was customary in such instances to receive a constitution from an elected or appointed lawgiver; however in Athens, lawgivers were appointed to reform the constitution from time to time (for example, [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]], [[Solon]]). In speaking of reform, Socrates uses the word "purge" (''diakathairountes'')&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 399e line 5.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same sense that Forms exist purged of matter.

The purged society is a regulated one presided over by philosophers educated by the state, who maintain three non-hereditary classes&lt;ref&gt;"Types" (''genē'') rather than the English economic classes or the favored populations of the real Greek cities.&lt;/ref&gt; as required: the tradesmen (including merchants and professionals), the guardians (militia and police) and the philosophers (legislators, administrators and the philosopher-king). Class is assigned at the end of education, when the state institutes individuals in their occupation. Socrates expects class to be hereditary but he allows for mobility according to natural ability. The criteria for selection by the academics is ability to perceive forms (the analog of English "intelligence") and martial spirit as well as predisposition or aptitude.

The views of Socrates on the proper order of society are certainly contrary to Athenian values of the time and must have produced a shock effect, intentional or not, accounting for the animosity against him. For example, reproduction is much too important to be left in the hands of untrained individuals: "... the possession of women and the procreation of children ... will ... follow the general principle that friends have all things in common, ...."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 424.&lt;/ref&gt; The family is therefore to be abolished and the children – whatever their parentage – to be raised by the appointed mentors of the state.

Their genetic fitness is to be monitored by the physicians: "... he ([[Asclepius]], a culture hero) did not want to lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or have weak fathers begetting weaker sons – if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him ...."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians minister to the healthy rather than cure the sick: "... (Physicians) will minister to better natures, giving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing at all in Greek medicine so far as can be known supports the airy (in the Athenian view) propositions of Socrates. Yet it is hard to be sure of Socrates' real views considering that there are no works written by Socrates himself. There are two common ideas pertaining to the beliefs and character of Socrates: the first being the Mouthpiece Theory where writers use Socrates in dialogue as a mouthpiece to get their own views across. However, since most of what we know about Socrates comes from plays, most of the Platonic plays are accepted as the more accurate Socrates since Plato was a direct student of Socrates.

Perhaps the most important principle is that just as the Good must be supreme so must its image, the state, take precedence over individuals in everything. For example, guardians "... will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never, under the influence either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 412.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of requiring guardians of guardians perhaps suffers from the Third Man weakness (see below): guardians require guardians require guardians, ad infinitum. The ultimate trusty guardian is missing. Socrates does not hesitate to face governmental issues many later governors have found formidable: "Then if anyone at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of the state should be the persons, and they ... may be allowed to lie for the public good."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's conception of Forms actually differs from dialogue to dialogue, and in certain respects it is never fully explained, so many aspects of the theory are open to interpretation. Forms are first introduced in the Phaedo, but in that dialogue the concept is simply referred to as something the participants are already familiar with, and the theory itself is not developed. Similarly, in the Republic, Plato relies on the concept of Forms as the basis of many of his arguments but feels no need to argue for the validity of the theory itself or to explain precisely what Forms are. Commentators have been left with the task of explaining what Forms are and how visible objects participate in them, and there has been no shortage of disagreement. Some scholars advance the view that Forms are paradigms, perfect examples on which the imperfect world is modeled. Others interpret Forms as universals, so that the Form of Beauty, for example, is that quality that all beautiful things share. Yet others interpret Forms as "stuffs," the conglomeration of all instances of a quality in the visible world. Under this interpretation, we could say there is a little beauty in one person, a little beauty in another—all the beauty in the world put together is the Form of Beauty. Plato himself was aware of the ambiguities and inconsistencies in his Theory of Forms, as is evident from the incisive criticism he makes of his own theory in the Parmenides.

==Evidence of Forms==
Plato's main evidence for the existence of Forms is [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] only and is as follows.

===Human perception===
We call both the sky and blue jeans by the same color, blue. However, clearly a pair of jeans and the sky are not the same color; moreover, the wavelengths of light reflected by the sky at every location and all the millions of blue jeans in every state of fading constantly change, and yet we somehow have a consensus of the basic form Blueness as it applies to them. Says Plato:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', paragraph 440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] in ''Metaphysics'' Α987a.29–b.14 and Μ1078b9–32 says that Plato devised the Forms to answer a weakness in the doctrine of [[Heraclitus]], who held that nothing exists, but everything is in a state of flow. If nothing exists then nothing can be known. It is possible that Plato took the Socratic search for definitions and extrapolated it into a distinct metaphysical theory. Little is known of the historical Socrates' own views, but the theory of Forms is likely a Platonic innovation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But if the very nature of knowledge changes, at the time when the change occurs there will be no knowledge, and, according to this view, there will be no one to know and nothing to be known: but if that which knows and that which is known exist ever, and the beautiful and the good and every other thing also exist, then I do not think that they can resemble a process of flux, as we were just now supposing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plato believed that long before our bodies ever existed, our souls existed and inhabited heaven, where they became directly acquainted with the forms themselves. Real knowledge, to him, was knowledge of the forms. But knowledge of the forms cannot be gained through sensory experience because the forms are not in the physical world. Therefore, our real knowledge of the forms must be the memory of our initial acquaintance with the forms in heaven. Therefore, what we seem to learn is in fact just remembering.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D, (2006), The Intellectual Devotional, p27, Borders Group, Inc, Ann Arbor. {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfection===
No one has ever seen a [[Perfection|perfect]] circle, nor a perfectly straight line, yet everyone knows what a circle and a straight line are. Plato utilizes the tool-maker's blueprint as evidence that Forms are real:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', paragraph 389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... when a man has discovered the instrument which is naturally adapted to each work, he must express this natural form, and not others which he fancies, in the material ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perceived circles or lines are not exactly circular or straight, and true circles and lines could never be detected since by definition they are sets of infinitely small points. But if the perfect ones were not real, how could they direct the manufacturer?

==Criticisms of Platonic Forms==
===Self-criticism===
Plato was well aware of the limitations of the theory, as he offered  his own criticisms of it in his dialogue [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']].  There Socrates is portrayed as a young philosopher acting as junior counterfoil to aged Parmenides. To a certain extent it is tongue-in-cheek as the older Socrates will have solutions to some of the problems  that are made to puzzle the younger.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The dialogue does present a very real difficulty with the Theory of Forms, which Plato most likely only viewed as problems for later thought. These criticisms were later emphasized by [[Aristotle]] in rejecting an independently existing world of Forms. It is worth noting that Aristotle was a pupil and then a junior colleague of Plato; it is entirely possible that the presentation of ''Parmenides'' "sets up" for Aristotle; that is, they agreed to disagree.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

One difficulty lies in the conceptualization of the "participation" of an object in a form (or Form). The young Socrates conceives of his solution to the problem of the universals in another metaphor, which though wonderfully apt, remains to be elucidated:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nay, but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same in many places at once, and yet continuous with itself; in this way each idea may be one and the same in all at the same time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But exactly how is a Form like the day in being everywhere at once? The solution calls for a distinct form, in which the particular instances, which are not identical to the form, participate; i.e., the form is shared out somehow like the day to many places. The concept of "participate", represented in Greek by more than one word, is as obscure in Greek as it is in English. Plato hypothesized that distinctness meant existence as an independent being, thus opening himself to the famous [[third man argument]] of Parmenides,&lt;ref&gt;The name is from [[Aristotle]], who says in ''Metaphysics'' A.IX.990b.15: "(The argument) they call the third man." A summary of the argument and the quote from Aristotle can be found in the venerable {{Cite journal | first=George | last=Grote | author-link=George Grote | contribution=App I Aristotle's Objections to Plato's Theory  | title=Aristotle: Second Edition with Additions | year=1880 | pages=559–60 note b | place=London | publisher=John Murray }} (downloadable Google Books). Grote points out that Aristotle lifted this argument from the ''Parmenides'' of Plato; certainly, his words indicate the argument was already well-known under that name.&lt;/ref&gt; which proves that forms cannot independently exist and be participated.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis of the argument has been going on for quite a number of centuries now and some analyses are complex, technical and perhaps tedious for the general reader. Those who are interested in the more technical analyses can find more of a presentation in {{cite journal | last=Hales | first=Steven D. |  title=The Recurring Problem of the Third Man | journal=Auslegung | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=67–80 | year=1991 | url=http://www.bloomu.edu/departments/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/thirdman.pdf }} and {{cite journal | last=Durham | first=Michael | title=Two Men and the Third Man | journal=The Dualist: Undergraduate Journal of Philosophy (Stanford University) | volume=4 | year=1997 | url=http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/durham.pdf | format= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If universal and particulars – say man or greatness – all exist and are the same then the Form is not one but is multiple. If they are only like each other then they contain a form that is the same and others that are different. Thus if we presume that the Form and a particular are alike then there must be another, or third Form, man or greatness by possession of which they are alike. An [[infinite regress]]ion would then result; that is, an endless series of third men. The ultimate participant, greatness, rendering the entire series great, is missing. Moreover, any Form is not unitary but is composed of infinite parts, none of which is the proper Form.

The young Socrates (some may say the young Plato) did not give up the Theory of Forms over the Third Man but took another tack, that the particulars do not exist as such. Whatever they are, they "mime" the Forms, appearing to be particulars. This is a clear dip into [[Representative realism|representationalism]], that we cannot observe the objects as they are in themselves but only their representations. That view has the weakness that if only the mimes can be observed then the real Forms cannot be known at all and the observer can have no idea of what the representations are supposed to represent or that they are representations.

Socrates' later answer would be that men already know the Forms because they were in the world of Forms before birth. The mimes only recall these Forms to memory.&lt;ref&gt;Plato to a large extent identifies what today is called [[insight]] with recollection: "whenever on seeing one thing you conceived another whether like or unlike, there must surely have been an act of recollection?" – ''[[Phaedo]]'', paragraph 229. Thus geometric reasoning on the part of persons who know no geometry is not insight but is  recollection. He does recognize insight: "... with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every problem ..." (with regard to "the course of scrutiny") – ''[[The Seventh Letter]]'' 344b. Unfortunately the hidden world can in no way be verified in this world and its otherworldness can only be a matter of speculation. Plato was aware of the problem: "How real existence is to be studied or discovered is, I suspect, beyond you and me." – ''[[Cratylus]]'', paragraph 439.&lt;/ref&gt;  The comedian [[Aristophanes]] wrote a play, ''[[The Clouds]]'', poking fun of Socrates with his head in the clouds.

===Aristotelian criticism===
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|180 px|The central image from Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509–1511), depicting Plato (left) and Aristotle (right).  Plato is depicted pointing upwards, in reference to his belief in the higher Forms, while Aristotle disagrees and gestures downwards to the here-and-now, in reference to his belief in [[empiricism]].]]
The topic of Aristotle's criticism of Plato's Theory of Forms is a large one and continues to expand. Rather than quote Plato, Aristotle often summarized. Classical commentaries thus recommended Aristotle as an introduction to Plato. As a historian of prior thought, Aristotle was invaluable, however this was secondary to his own dialectic and in some cases he treats purported implications as if Plato had actually mentioned them, or even defended them. In examining Aristotle's criticism of The Forms, it is helpful to understand Aristotle's own [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic forms]], by which he intends to salvage much of Plato's theory.

In the summary passage quoted above&lt;ref name=summ&gt;Paragraph 50 a–c, Jowett translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato distinguishes between real and non-real "existing things", where the latter term is used of substance. The figures that the artificer places in the gold are not substance, but gold is. Aristotle stated that, for Plato, all things studied by the sciences have Form and asserted that Plato considered only substance to have Form. Uncharitably, this leads him to something like a contradiction: Forms existing as the objects of science, but not-existing as non-substance. Scottish philosopher [[W.D. Ross]] objects to this as a mischaracterization of Plato.&lt;ref name=rossXI&gt;Ross, Chapter XI, initial.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato did not claim to know where the line between Form and non-Form is to be drawn. As Cornford points out,&lt;ref&gt;Pages 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; those things about which the young Socrates (and Plato) asserted "I have often been puzzled about these things"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', paragraph 130c.&lt;/ref&gt; (in reference to Man, Fire and Water), appear as Forms in later works. However, others do not, such as Hair, Mud, Dirt. Of these, Socrates is made to assert, "it would be too absurd to suppose that they have a Form."

Ross&lt;ref name=rossXI/&gt; also objects to Aristotle's criticism that Form Otherness accounts for the differences between Forms and purportedly leads to contradictory forms: the Not-tall, the Not-beautiful, etc. That particulars participate in a Form is for Aristotle much too vague to permit analysis. By one way in which he unpacks the concept, the Forms would cease to be of one essence due to any multiple participation. As Ross indicates, Plato didn't make that leap from "A is not B" to "A is Not-B." Otherness would only apply to its own particulars and not to those of other Forms. For example, there is no Form Not-Greek, only ''particulars'' of Form Otherness that somehow ''suppress'' Form Greek.

Regardless of whether Socrates meant the particulars of Otherness yield Not-Greek, Not-tall, Not-beautiful, etc., the particulars would operate specifically rather than generally, each somehow yielding only one exclusion.

Plato had postulated that we know Forms through a remembrance of the soul's [[metempsychosis|past lives]] and Aristotle's arguments against this treatment of [[epistemology]] are compelling. For Plato, particulars somehow do not exist, and, on the face of it, "that which is non-existent cannot be known".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' 71b.25.&lt;/ref&gt; See ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' III 3–4.&lt;ref&gt;Book III Chapters 3–4, paragraphs 999a ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholastic criticism===
[[Nominalism]] (from Latin ''nomen'', "name") says that ideal universals are mere names, human creations; the blueness shared by sky and blue jeans is a shared concept, communicated by our word "blueness". Blueness is held not to have any existence beyond that which it has in instances of blue things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Borghini |first1=Andrea |title=The Debate Between Nominalism and Realism |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/nominalism-vs-realism-2670598 |website=ThoughtCo |language=en |date=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept arose in the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rodriguez-Pereyra |first1=Gonzalo |title=Nominalism in Metaphysics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nominalism-metaphysics/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of [[Scholasticism]].

Scholasticism was a highly multinational, polyglottal school of philosophy, and the nominalist argument may be more obvious if an example is given in more than one language. For instance, [[colour term]]s are strongly variable by language; some languages consider blue and green the same colour, others have monolexemic terms for several shades of blue, which are considered different; other, like the Mandarin ''qing'' denote both blue and black. The German word "Stift" means a pen or a pencil, and also anything of the same shape. English does not have such a word. The English "pencil" originally meant "small paintbrush"; the term later included the silver rod used for [[silverpoint]]. The German "[[Lead (element)|Blei]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;stift" and "[[Silver|Silber]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;stift" can both be called "Stift", but this term also includes felt-tip pens, which are clearly not pencils.

The shifting and overlapping nature of these concepts makes it easy to imagine them as mere names, with meanings not rigidly defined, but specific enough to be useful for communication. Given a group of objects, how is one to decide if it contains only instances of a single Form, or several mutually-exclusive Forms?

The '''International Philosophical Bibliography''' ('''IPB'''), also known in French as ''Répertoire bibliographique de la philosophie'' (RBP), is a [[bibliographic database]] covering publications on the history of philosophy and [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name="POB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pob.peeters-leuven.be/content.php|title=International Philosophical Bibliography|publisher=Peeters Online Bibliographies|accessdate=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The database comprises records of publications in over 30 languages. Annually, about 12,000 records are added.&lt;ref name="POB" /&gt; The indexes include, among other elements, over 84,000 names of authors, editors, translators, reviewers, and collaborators, as well as more than 3,000 commentaries on philosophical works, making it the world's most complete index in Philosophy.&lt;ref name="HIW"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hiw.kuleuven.be/en/about-us/facts-and-figures|title=KU Leuven Institute of Philosophy|publisher=[[KU Leuven]]|language=en|accessdate=5 April 2020|quote=The world's most complete index in Philosophy: the International Philosophical Bibliography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1934, the IPB has been developed by the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]] at the [[Université catholique de Louvain|University of Louvain]] (UCLouvain), first in [[Leuven]] and since 1978 in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]].&lt;ref name="UCLouvain"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uclouvain.be/fr/instituts-recherche/isp/ipb.html|title=

'''Rationality''' is the quality or state of being rational – that is, being based on or agreeable to [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rationality|title=Definition of RATIONALITY|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational|title=Definition of RATIONAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rationality implies the conformity of one's beliefs with one's [[reason (argument)|reason]]s to believe, and of one's actions with one's [[reason (argument)|reason]]s for action. "Rationality" has different specialized meanings in [[philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/reason|title=Reason|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[game theory]] and [[political science]].

To determine what behavior is the most rational, one needs to make several key assumptions, and also needs a logical formulation of the problem. When the goal or problem involves making a decision, rationality factors in all information that is available (e.g. complete or incomplete [[knowledge]]). Collectively, the formulation and background assumptions are the models within which rationality applies. Rationality is relative: if one accepts a model in which benefitting oneself is optimal, then rationality is equated with behavior that is self-interested to the point of being selfish; whereas if one accepts a model in which benefiting the group is optimal, then purely selfish behavior is deemed irrational. It is thus meaningless to assert rationality without also specifying the background model assumptions describing how the problem is framed and formulated.

==Theories of rational thinking==
===Max Weber===
The German scholar [[Max Weber]] proposed an interpretation of [[Social actions|social action]] that distinguished between four different [[ideal type|idealized types]] of rationality.&lt;ref name=kalberg/&gt;

The first, which he called ''Zweckrational'' or purposive/[[instrumental rationality]], is related to the expectations about the behavior of other human beings or objects in the environment. These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were "rationally pursued and calculated." The second type, Weber called ''Wertrational'' or value/belief-oriented. Here the action is undertaken for what one might call reasons intrinsic to the actor: some ethical, aesthetic, religious or other motives, independent of whether it will lead to success. The third type was affectual, determined by an actor's specific affect, feeling, or emotion—to which Weber himself said that this was a kind of rationality that was on the borderline of what he considered "meaningfully oriented." The fourth was traditional or conventional, determined by ingrained habituation. Weber emphasized that it was very unusual to find only one of these orientations: combinations were the norm. His usage also makes clear that he considered the first two as more significant than the others, and it is arguable that the third and fourth are subtypes of the first two.

The advantage in Weber's interpretation of rationality is that it avoids a value-laden assessment, say, that certain kinds of beliefs are irrational. Instead, Weber suggests that ground or motive can be given—for religious or affect reasons, for example—that may meet the criterion of explanation or justification even if it is not an explanation that fits the ''Zweckrational'' orientation of means and ends. The opposite is therefore also true: some means-ends explanations will not satisfy those whose grounds for action are ''Wertrational''.

Weber's constructions of rationality have been critiqued both from a [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] (1984) perspective (as devoid of social context and under-theorised in terms of social power)&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas]] (1984) ''The Theory of Communicative Action Volume&amp;nbsp;1; Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and also from a [[feminist]] perspective (Eagleton, 2003) whereby Weber's rationality constructs are viewed as imbued with masculine values and oriented toward the maintenance of male power.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, M. (ed) (2003) ''A Concise Companion to Feminist Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.{{page needed|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative position on rationality (which includes both [[bounded rationality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hawkins |first1=David |last2=Simon |first2=Herbert A. |title=Note: Some Conditions of Macroeconomic Stability |journal=Econometrica |date=July 1949 |volume=17 |issue=3/4 |pages=245–8 |doi=10.2307/1905526 |jstor=1905526 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the affective and value-based arguments of Weber) can be found in the critique of Etzioni (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Etzioni |first1=Amitai |title=Normative-affective factors: Toward a new decision-making model |journal=Journal of Economic Psychology |date=June 1988 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=125–150 |doi=10.1016/0167-4870(88)90048-7 }} Republished in: {{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03900-7_5 |chapter=Normative-Affective Factors: Toward a New Decision-Making Model |title=Essays in Socio-Economics |pages=91–119 |series=Studies in Economic Ethics and Philosophy |year=1999 |last1=Etzioni |first1=Amitai |isbn=978-3-642-08415-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who reframes thought on decision-making to argue for a reversal of the position put forward by Weber. Etzioni illustrates how purposive/instrumental reasoning is subordinated by normative considerations (ideas on how people 'ought' to behave) and affective considerations (as a support system for the development of human relationships).

===Psychology===
In the [[psychology of reasoning]], psychologists and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] have defended different positions on human rationality. One prominent view, due to [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.&amp;nbsp;J. Byrne]] among others is that humans are rational in principle but they err in practice, that is, humans have the competence to be rational but their performance is limited by various factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson-Laird |first1=Philip N. |last2=Byrne |first2=Ruth M. J. |title=Corrigendum: 'If' and the problems of conditional reasoning |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=1 September 2009 |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=282–287 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that many standard tests of reasoning, such as those on the [[conjunction fallacy]], on the [[Wason selection task]], or the [[base rate fallacy]] suffer from methodological and conceptual problems. This has led to disputes in psychology over whether researchers should (only) use standard rules of logic, probability theory and statistics, or rational choice theory as norms of good reasoning. Opponents of this view, such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], favor a conception of [[bounded rationality]], especially for tasks under high uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Thomas |title=The 'Rationality Wars' in Psychology: Where They Are and Where They Could Go |journal=Inquiry |date=February 2012 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=66–81 |doi=10.1080/0020174X.2012.643628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Brandt===
[[Richard Brandt]] proposed a "reforming definition" of rationality, arguing someone is rational if their notions survive a form of [[psychotherapy|cognitive-psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethical Theory: The Problems of Normative and Critical Ethics|url=https://archive.org/details/ethicaltheorypro0000bran|url-access=registration|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author=Richard B. Brandt|year=1959}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality==
Abulof argues that rationality has become an "essentially contested concept," as its "proper use… inevitably involves endless disputes." He identifies "four fronts" for the disputes about the meaning of rationality: 
# The purpose, or function, of ascribing rationality: Is it descriptive/explanatory, prescriptive or subjunctive (rationality "as if" real)? 
# The subject of rationality: What, or who is rational: the choice, the act, or the choosing actor?
# Cognition: What is the quality of the cognitive decision-making process: minimal (calculative intentionality) or optimal (expected-utility)? 
# Rationale: Is rationality merely instrumental, that is, agnostic about the logic of human action and its motivations (instrumental rationality) or does it substantially inform them (substantive rationality, focusing on material maximization)?&lt;ref name="Abulof"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abulof |first1=Uriel |title=The malpractice of 'rationality' in international relations |journal=Rationality and Society |date=16 July 2015 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=358–384 |doi=10.1177/1043463115593144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by some philosophers (notably [[A.&amp;nbsp;C. Grayling]]) that a good rationale must be independent of emotions, personal feelings or any kind of instincts. Any process of evaluation or analysis, that may be called rational, is expected to be highly objective, logical and "mechanical". If these minimum requirements are not satisfied i.e. if a person has been, even slightly, influenced by personal emotions, feelings, instincts, or culturally specific moral codes and norms, then the analysis may be termed irrational, due to the injection of subjective bias.

Modern [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] show that studying the role of emotion in mental function (including topics ranging from flashes of scientific insight to making future plans), that no human has ever satisfied this criterion, except perhaps a person with no affective feelings, for example, an individual with a massively damaged [[amygdala]] or severe psychopathy. Thus, such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers, and not people. However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Theoretical and practical==
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had distinguished theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [[Jesús Mosterín]] makes a parallel distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Mosterín, Jesús (2008). ''Lo mejor posible: Racionalidad y acción humana''. Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 2008. 318 pp. {{ISBN|978-84-206-8206-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform.

The distinction is also described as that between epistemic rationality, the attempt to form beliefs in an unbiased manner, and instrumental rationality.

Theoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to [[consistency|logical consistency]] and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. Mosterín distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mosterín |first1=Jesús |title=Acceptance without belief |journal=Manuscrito |date=2002 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=313–335 |url=https://periodicos.sbu.unicamp.br/ojs/index.php/manuscrito/article/view/8644540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one's best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible.

==Examples in different fields==

===Logic===
{{main|Logic and rationality}}
As the study of arguments that are correct in virtue of their form, [[logic]] is of fundamental importance in the study of rationality.  The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.

===Economics===
Rationality plays a key role in economics and there are several strands to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Paul Anand|year=1993}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality—basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational—that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on the accuracy of beliefs and full use of information—in this view, a person who is not rational has beliefs that don't fully use the information they have.

Debates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are "really" rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of [[bounded rationality]] makes more sense for such models.

Others think that any kind of rationality along the lines of [[rational choice theory]] is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term ''[[homo economicus]]'' (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is [[logically consistent]] but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view.  [[Behavioral economics]] aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.

===Artificial intelligence===
Within [[artificial intelligence]], a ''[[intelligent agent|rational agent]]'' is typically one that maximizes its [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]], given its current knowledge. [[Utility]] is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of "performance", which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the [[psychology of reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''. Hillsdale: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International relations===
There is an ongoing debate over the merits of using “rationality” in the study of [[international relations]] (IR). Some scholars hold it indispensable.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno De Mesquita, Bruce (2010) Foreign Policy Analysis and Rational Choice Models. In The International Studies Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Allen Denemark. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.{{page needed|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are more critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walt |first1=Stephen M. |title=Rigor or Rigor Mortis? Rational Choice and Security Studies |journal=International Security |date=April 1999 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=5–48 |doi=10.1162/isec.23.4.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the pervasive and persistent usage of "rationality" in political science and IR is beyond dispute. "Rationality" remains ubiquitous in this field. Abulof finds that Some 40% of all scholarly references to "foreign policy" allude to "rationality"—and this ratio goes up to more than half of pertinent academic publications in the 2000s. He further argues that when it comes to concrete security and foreign policies, IR employment of rationality borders on "malpractice": rationality-based descriptions are largely either false or unfalsifiable; many observers fail to explicate the meaning of "rationality" they employ; and the concept is frequently used politically to distinguish between "us and them."&lt;ref name=Abulof/&gt;

'''''The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters''''' ({{lang-es|El sueño de la razón produce monstruos}}) is an [[etching]] by the Spanish painter and printmaker [[Francisco Goya]]. Created between 1797 and 1799 for the ''Diario de Madrid'',&lt;ref name="Nehamas"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nehamas |first1=Alexander |title="The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters" |journal=Representations |date=2001 |volume=74 |issue=Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeweems.com/goya/sleep_of_reason.html |title=Goya - The Sleep of Reason |publisher=Eeweems.com |accessdate=2012-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107043903/http://eeweems.com/goya/sleep_of_reason.html |archivedate=2012-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the 43rd of the 80 etchings making up the satirical ''[[Los caprichos|Los Caprichos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.cornell.edu/collections/view/the-sleep-of-reason-produces-monsters.html ''The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters''] [[Johnson Museum of Art]], [[Cornell University]], 2013. Retrieved 11 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many suggest that the artist Goya depicts himself asleep amidst his drawing tools, his reason dulled by slumber, bedeviled by creatures that prowl in the dark. The work includes owls that may be symbols of folly and bats symbolizing ignorance. Implied in Goya's preparatory inscription,&lt;ref name="Nehamas"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nehamas |first1=Alexander |title="The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters" |journal=Representations |date=2001 |volume=74 |issue=Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt; the artist's nightmare reflects his view of Spanish society, which he portrayed in the ''Caprichos'' as demented, corrupt, and ripe for ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = The Metropolitan Museum of Art | authorlink = Metropolitan Museum of Art | title = Francisco de Goya y Lucientes: The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters: Plate 43 of The Caprices (Los Caprichos) | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/09/eusi/ho_18.64.43.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The full epigraph for capricho No. 43 reads; "Fantasy abandoned by reason produces impossible monsters: united with her [reason], she [fantasy] is the mother of the arts and the origin of their marvels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Robin M. |last2=Vrudny |first2=Kimberly J. |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=if4hQec2ClEC&amp;pg=PA39 |title=Visual Theology: Forming and Transforming the Community Through the Arts |publisher=Liturgical Press |page=39 |isbn=978-0-814-65399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the title phrase is rendered as "The dream of reason produces monsters", since the Spanish word "sueño" can mean either "sleep" or "dream".

Goya's etching, and its title, perhaps recalls the words of Teresa of Avila (1515-1582) "For since this humour [melancholy, ie. depression] can subdue reason, what won't our passions do once reason is darkened? ...if reason is wanting, madness results ..." ("The Book of her Foundations" [1573-6], 7, 2).

==Preparatory drawings==
Goya produced preparatory drawings for all the prints in the "Los caprichos" series.&lt;ref name="drawings"&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/whats-on/exhibition/solo-la-voluntad-me-sobra-drawings-by-goya/802339bb-1b74-8f92-d9ac-091244d4e474# Caprichos]. Goya. Drawings. "Only my Strength of Will Remains". Museo del Prado.&lt;/ref&gt; One drawing suggests that ''The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters'' was being considered for use as the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of the collection, although in the event it was not used for this purpose in the printed version which starts with a self-portrait.

File:Ydioma universal.jpg|1797
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Technical aspects==
As a set "Los caprichos" is notable for its use of [[aquatint]]. In ''The Sleep of Reason'' there is a contrast between the etched lines of the foreground and the areas of tone, produced by aquatint, which are used for the creatures in the background.

'''Epistemic cultures''' (most of the times in plural form) are a concept developed in the nineties by [[anthropologist]] [[Karin Knorr Cetina]] in her book ''Epistemic Cultures, how the sciences make knowledge.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epistemic cultures : how the sciences make knowledge|last=(Karin)|first=Knorr-Cetina, K.|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674258932|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=39539508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposed to a [[Monism|monist]] vision of scientific activity (according to which, would exist  a unique [[scientific method]]), Knorr Cetina defines the concept of epistemic cultures as a diversity of scientific activities according to different scientific fields, not only in methods and tools, but also in types of reasonings, ways to establish evidence, and relationships between theory and [[Empiricism|empiry]]. Knorr Cetina's work is seminal in questioning the so-called [[unity of science]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

== Knorr Cetina's anthropology ==
In practice, Knorr Cetina compares two contemporary important scientific fields:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Particle physics|High energy physics]] and [[molecular biology]]. She worked as an anthropologist within two laboratories, along the line of the laboratory anthropology work by [[Bruno Latour|Latour]] and [[Steve Woolgar|Woolgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://site.ebrary.com/id/10035890|title=Laboratory life: the construction of scientific facts|last=Latour|first=Bruno|last2=Woolgar|first2=Steve|date=1986|isbn=9781400820412|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her anthropological work is comparative and the two chosen scientific fields are highly mediaticized and easily distinguishable.

Epistemic cultures as a philosophical concept has been perused by numerous philosophical, anthropological or historical studies of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wray|first=K. Brad|date=February 2009|title=The Epistemic Cultures of Science and Wikipedia: A Comparison|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/episteme/article/the-epistemic-cultures-of-science-and-wikipedia-a-comparison/5BE5D183239F3793DAEB346573DD9F49|journal=Episteme|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=38–51|doi=10.3366/E1742360008000531|issn=1750-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heidler|first=Richard|date=2017-09-01|title=Epistemic Cultures in Conflict: The Case of Astronomy and High Energy Physics|journal=Minerva|language=en|volume=55|issue=3|pages=249–277|doi=10.1007/s11024-017-9315-3|issn=1573-1871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two distinct publication regimes ==
High energy physics and molecular biology are very different as scientific fields belonging to two different epistemic cultures. They also are very different in terms of [[academic authorship]]. Biagioli describes this difference in terms of publications culture regarding number of authors per paper, distribution of contributorship within authors, [[preprint]] policy and he precisely chooses to oppose the very same domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scientific authorship : credit and intellectual property in science|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|others=Biagioli, Mario, 1955-, Galison, Peter, 1955-|isbn=0415942934|location=New York, NY|oclc=51342797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of human rights}}
[[File:Us declaration independence.jpg|right|thumb|[[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] ratified by the [[Continental Congress]] on 4 July 1776]]
Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights.&lt;ref name="Freeman15"/&gt; The true forerunner of human-rights discourse was the concept of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] which appeared as part of the medieval [[natural law]] tradition that became prominent during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
 
17th-century English philosopher [[John Locke]] discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being "life, liberty, and estate (property)", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the [[social contract]]. In Britain in 1689, the English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the Scottish [[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]] each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Britain's unwritten constitution |url= http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution |publisher=British Library |accessdate=27 November 2015 |quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown ... providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from 'cruel or unusual punishment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights. Additionally, the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental [[civil rights]] and civil freedoms.

{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.|United States Declaration of Independence, 1776}}

===1800 to World War I===

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|left|thumb|[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] approved by the National Assembly of France, 26 August 1789]]
Philosophers such as [[Thomas Paine]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Hegel]] expanded on the theme of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1831 [[William Lloyd Garrison]] wrote in a newspaper called ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' that he was trying to enlist his readers in "the great cause of human rights"&lt;ref&gt;Mayer (2000) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; so the term ''human rights'' probably came into use sometime between Paine's ''The Rights of Man'' and Garrison's publication. In 1849 a contemporary, [[Henry David Thoreau]], wrote about human rights in his treatise ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20070125084109/http://www.cs.indiana.edu/statecraft/civ.dis.html ] which was later influential on human rights and civil rights thinkers. United States [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|Supreme Court Justice David Davis]], in his 1867 opinion for [[Ex Parte Milligan]], wrote "By the protection of the law, human rights are secured; withdraw that protection and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers or the clamor of an excited people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Ex Parte Milligan'', 71 U.S. 2, 119. (full text) |url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/tribunals/docs/milligan.pdf |date=December 1866 |accessdate=28 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307053820/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/tribunals/docs/milligan.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many groups and movements have managed to achieve profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. In Western Europe and North America, [[trade union|labour union]]s brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating [[child labor|child labour]]. The [[women's rights]] movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to [[vote]]. [[National liberation]] movements in many countries succeeded in driving out colonial powers. One of the most influential was [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s movement to free his native [[India]] from British rule. Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the [[civil rights movement]], and more recent diverse [[identity politics]] movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States.

The foundation of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the 1864 [[Lieber Code]] and the first of the [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1864 laid the foundations of [[International humanitarian law]], to be further developed following the two World Wars.

===Between World War I and World War II===

The [[League of Nations]] was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following the end of [[World War I]]. The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation, diplomacy and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its Charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights which were later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The League of Nations had mandates to support many of the former colonies of the Western European colonial powers during their transition from colony to independent state.

Established as an agency of the League of Nations, and now part of United Nations, the [[International Labour Organization]] also had a mandate to promote and safeguard certain of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR):

===After World War II===
On the issue of "universal", the declarations did not apply to domestic discrimination or racism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gordon Lauren, “First Principles of Racial Equality: History and the Politics and Diplomacy of Human Rights Provisions in the United Nations Charter,” ''Human Rights Quarterly'' 5 (1983): 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry J. Richardson III has argued:
:All major governments at the time of drafting the U.N. charter and the Universal declaration did their best to ensure, by all means known to domestic and international law, that these principles had only international application and carried no legal obligation on those governments to be implemented domestically. All tacitly realized that for their own discriminated-against minorities to acquire leverage on the basis of legally being able to claim enforcement of these wide-reaching rights would create pressures that would be political dynamite.&lt;ref&gt;Henry J. Richardson III, “Black People, Technocracy, and Legal Process: Thoughts, Fears, and Goals,” in ''Public Policy for the Black Community,'' ed. by Marguerite Ross Barnett and James A. Hefner (Port Washington, N.Y.: Alfred Publishing, 1976), p, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;
====Universal Declaration of Human Rights====

{{main|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}

[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt UDHR.jpg|right|thumb|200px|"It is not a [[treaty]]...[In the future, it] may well become the international [[Magna Carta]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/eleanorrooseveltdeclarationhumanrights.htm Eleanor Roosevelt: Address to the United Nations General Assembly] 10 December 1948 in Paris, France&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] with the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1949]]
 
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) is a non-binding declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;(A/RES/217, 10 December 1948 at Palais de Chaillot, Paris)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948, partly in response to the barbarism of [[World War II]]. The UDHR urges member states to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights are part of the "foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world". The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behavior of states and press upon them duties to their citizens following the model of the [[corelative|rights-duty duality]].

{{quote|...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and [[inalienable rights]] of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

The UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission, with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as Chair, who began to discuss an ''International Bill of Rights'' in 1947. The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority.&lt;ref name=Glendon&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Rule of Law in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |last=Glendon |first=Mary Ann |url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/jihr/v2/5/ |journal=Northwestern University Journal of International Human Rights |date=July 2004 |volume=2 |number=5 |access-date=7 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720014500/http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/jihr/v2/5/ |archive-date=20 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian law professor John Humprey and French lawyer [[Rene Cassin]] were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. The final three articles place, according to Cassin, rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized.&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt; Humphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means, as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble:&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;

{{quote|Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Glendon (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ball, Gready 2007 p.34"&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.34&lt;/ref&gt; was predicated on the assumption that basic human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked. Though this principle was not opposed by any member states at the time of adoption (the declaration was adopted unanimously, with the abstention of the [[Soviet bloc]], [[Apartheid]] South Africa and [[Saudi Arabia]]), this principle was later subject to significant challenges.&lt;ref name="Ball, Gready 2007 p.34"/&gt;

The onset of the [[Cold War]] soon after the UDHR was conceived brought to the fore divisions over the inclusion of both economic and social rights and civil and political rights in the declaration. Capitalist states tended to place strong emphasis on civil and political rights (such as freedom of association and expression), and were reluctant to include economic and social rights (such as the right to work and the right to join a union). Socialist states placed much greater importance on economic and social rights and argued strongly for their inclusion.&lt;ref name="Ball, Gready 2007 p.35"&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the divisions over which rights to include, and because some states declined to ratify any treaties including certain specific interpretations of human rights, and despite the Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries arguing strongly for the inclusion of all rights in a so-called ''Unity Resolution'', the rights enshrined in the UDHR were split into two separate covenants, allowing states to adopt some rights and derogate others. Though this allowed the covenants to be created, it denied the proposed principle that all rights are linked which was central to some interpretations of the UDHR.&lt;ref name="Ball, Gready 2007 p.35"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Human Rights and Human Wrongs |author=Littman, David G. |date=19 January 2003 |quote=The principal aim of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was to create a framework for a universal code based on mutual consent. The early years of the United Nations were overshadowed by the division between the Western and Communist conceptions of human rights, although neither side called into question the concept of universality. The debate centered on which "rights" – political, economic, and social – were to be included among the Universal Instruments|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-littman011903.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the UDHR is a non-binding resolution, it is now considered to be a central component of international [[customary law]] which may be invoked under appropriate circumstances by state judiciaries and other judiciaries.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human Rights Treaties====

In 1966, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ('''ICCPR''') and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''ICESCR''') were adopted by the United Nations, between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states.&lt;ref&gt;This does not include the Vatican, which although recognised as an independent state, is not a member of the UN.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they came into force only in 1976, when they were ratified by a sufficient number of countries (despite achieving the ICCPR, a covenant including no economic or social rights, the US only ratified the ICCPR in 1992).&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.37&lt;/ref&gt; The ICESCR commits 155 state parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCR) to individuals. 
{{clr}}

Since then numerous other treaties ([[International human rights instruments|pieces of legislation]]) have been offered at the international level. They are generally known as ''human rights instruments''. Some of the most significant are:

*[[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] (adopted 1948, entry into force: 1951) [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm ]
*[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] ('''CERD''') (adopted 1966, entry into force: 1969) [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm ]

==International bodies==

===The United Nations===

{{main|United Nations}}

[[File:Unpicture.jpg|thumb|right|The UN General Assembly]]
The '''United Nations (UN)''' is the only multilateral governmental agency with universally accepted international [[jurisdiction]] for universal human rights legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.92&lt;/ref&gt; All UN organs have advisory roles to the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human rights treaties. The most senior body of the UN with regard to human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The United Nations has an international mandate to:

{{quote|...achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.|||Article 1–3 of the [[United Nations Charter]]}}

== Protection in the international level ==
===Human Rights Council===
{{main|United Nations Human Rights Council}}
The UN Human Rights Council, created in 2005, has a mandate to investigate alleged human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=United Nations News Page |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocusRel.asp?infocusID=114&amp;Body=human%20rights%20council&amp;Body1= |title=United Nations Rights Council Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; 47 of the 193 UN member states sit on the Council, elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses. The Council is based in [[Geneva]], and meets three times a year; with additional meetings to respond to urgent situations.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent experts (''rapporteurs'') are retained by the Council to investigate alleged human rights abuses and to report to the Council.

The [[Human Rights Council]] may request that the Security Council refer cases to the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;The Security Council referred the human rights situation in [[Darfur]] in Sudan to the ICC despite the fact that Sudan has a functioning legal system&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN treaty bodies===
{{anchor|Treaty bodies}}&lt;!-- [[Human rights treaty bodies]] redirects here --&gt;
In addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the UN charter, the UN has set up a number of ''treaty-based'' bodies, comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties. They are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor, With the exception of the CESCR, which was established under a resolution of the Economic and Social Council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the Covenant, they are technically autonomous bodies, established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties – rather than subsidiary to the United Nations, though in practice they are closely intertwined with the United Nations system and are supported by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (UNHCHR) and the UN Centre for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that unlike the other treaty bodies, the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties, but directly responsible to the Economic and Social Council and ultimately to the General Assembly. This means that the Economic Committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively "weak" means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies.&lt;ref name=Shaw309&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular difficulties noted by commentators include: perceived vagueness of the principles of the treaty, relative lack of legal texts and decisions, ambivalence of many states in addressing economic, social and cultural rights, comparatively few non-governmental organisations focused on the area and problems with obtaining relevant and precise information.&lt;ref name=Shaw309/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* The ''Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination'' monitors the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]] and conducts regular reviews of countries' performance. It can make judgments on complaints against member states allowing it, but these are not legally binding. It issues warnings to attempt to prevent serious contraventions of the convention.
* The ''Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women'' monitors the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]]. It receives states' reports on their performance and comments on them, and can make judgments on complaints against countries which have opted into the 1999 Optional Protocol.
* The ''Committee Against Torture'' monitors the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|CAT]] and receives states' reports on their performance every four years and comments on them. Its subcommittee may visit and inspect countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol.
* The ''[[Committee on the Rights of the Child]]'' monitors the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. It does not have the power to receive complaints.
* The ''Committee on Migrant Workers'' was established in 2004 and monitors the [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|ICRMW]] and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. It will have the power to receive complaints of specific violations only once ten member states allow it.
* The ''[[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]'' was established in 2008 to monitor the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. It has the power to receive complaints against the countries which have opted into the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].
* The ''Committee on Enforced Disappearances'' monitors the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance|ICPPED]]. All States parties are obliged to submit reports to the Committee on how the rights are being implemented. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations".

Each treaty body receives secretariat support from the Human Rights Council and Treaties Division of Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) in Geneva except CEDAW, which is supported by the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW). CEDAW formerly held all its sessions at United Nations headquarters in New York but now frequently meets at the United Nations Office in Geneva; the other treaty bodies meet in Geneva. The Human Rights Committee usually holds its March session in New York City.

{{main|Human rights in Africa}}

The [[African Union]] (AU) is a supranational union consisting of fifty-five African states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/memberstates/map.htm|title=AU Member States|publisher=African Union|accessdate=3 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105082457/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/memberstates/map.htm|archive-date=5 January 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2001, the AU's purpose is to help secure Africa's democracy, human rights, and a sustainable economy, especially by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective common market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/AboutAu/au_in_a_nutshell_en.htm|title=AU in a Nutshell|accessdate=3 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230204052/http://www.africa-union.org/root/AU/AboutAu/au_in_a_nutshell_en.htm|archive-date=30 December 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR) is a quasi-judicial organ of the African Union tasked with promoting and protecting human rights and collective (peoples') rights throughout the African continent as well as interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and considering individual complaints of violations of the Charter. The Commission has three broad areas of responsibility:&lt;ref name=mandate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/mandate_en.html|title=Mandate of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120104536/http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/mandate_en.html|archive-date=20 January 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Promoting human and peoples' rights 
* Protecting human and peoples' rights 
* Interpreting the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]]

In pursuit of these goals, the Commission is mandated to "collect documents, undertake studies and researches on African problems in the field of human and peoples, rights, organise seminars, symposia and conferences, disseminate information, encourage national and local institutions concerned with human and peoples' rights and, should the case arise, give its views or make recommendations to governments" (Charter, Art. 45).&lt;ref name=mandate/&gt;

With the creation of the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (under a protocol to the Charter which was adopted in 1998 and entered into force in January 2004), the Commission will have the additional task of preparing cases for submission to the Court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html|title=PROTOCOL TO THE AFRICAN CHARTER ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES' RIGHTS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AFRICAN COURT ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES' RIGHTS|accessdate=3 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302212249/http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html|archive-date=2 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2004 decision, the AU Assembly resolved that the future Court on Human and Peoples' Rights would be integrated with the African Court of Justice.

===Americas===
The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) is an international organization, headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. Its members are the thirty-five independent states of the Americas. Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the [[Cold War]], the return to democracy in Latin America, and the thrust toward [[globalization]], the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context. Its stated priorities now include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/key_issues/eng/default.asp|title=OAS Key Issues|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Strengthening democracy
* Working for peace
* Protecting human rights
* Combating corruption
* The rights of Indigenous Peoples
* Promoting sustainable development

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (the IACHR) is an autonomous organ of the Organization of American States, also based in Washington, D.C. Along with the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], based in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], Costa Rica, it is one of the bodies that comprise the inter-American system for the promotion and protection of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/biographies.asp?group=hhrr|publisher=Organization of American States|title=Directory of OAS Authorities|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IACHR is a permanent body which meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere. Its human rights duties stem from three documents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/what.htm|title=What is the IACHR?|publisher=Inter-Americal Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] 
* the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]

The Inter-Americal Court of Human Rights was established in 1979 with the purpose of enforcing and interpreting the provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights. Its two main functions are thus adjudicatory and advisory. Under the former, it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it. Under the latter, it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other OAS bodies or member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?CFID=25331&amp;CFTOKEN=36922058|title=InterAmerican Court on Human Rights homepage|publisher=Inter-American Court on Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]], founded in 1949, is the oldest organisation working for European integration. It is an international organisation with legal personality recognised under public international law and has observer status with the United Nations. The seat of the Council of Europe is in [[Strasbourg]] in France. The Council of Europe is responsible for both the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Council&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Human_rights/|title=Council of Europe Human Rights|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions bind the Council's members to a code of human rights which, though strict, are more lenient than those of the United Nations charter on human rights. The Council also promotes the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Human_Rights/Esc/|title=Social Charter|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is open to all European states which seek [[European integration]], accept the principle of the [[rule of law]] and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and [[freedom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/e/Com/about_coe/|title=The Council of Europe in Brief|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophies of human rights==
{{rights}}

Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights become part of social expectations.

One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds.

Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract.

===Natural rights===

{{main|Natural law|Natural rights}}

Natural law theories base human rights on a "natural" moral, religious or even biological order which is independent of transitory human laws or traditions.

[[Socrates]] and his philosophic heirs, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (''dikaion physikon'', ''δικαιον φυσικον'', [[Latin]] ''ius naturale'').  Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law,&lt;ref&gt;Shellens (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of this tradition of [[natural justice]] into one of natural law is usually attributed to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sills (1968, 1972) ''Natural Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the early [[Church fathers]] sought to incorporate the until then [[pagan]] concept of natural law into Christianity. Natural law theories have featured greatly in the philosophies of [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], and [[John Locke]].

In the Seventeenth Century [[Thomas Hobbes]] founded a [[social contract|contractualist theory]] of [[legal positivism]] on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) was subject to contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death at the hands of another). The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. It was discovered by considering humankind's [[natural rights]], whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law.  In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.

[[Hugo Grotius]] based his philosophy of international law on natural law. He wrote that "even the will of an [[omnipotent]] being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no God or that he does not care for human affairs." (''De iure belli ac pacis'', Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument ''etiamsi daremus'' (''non-esse Deum''), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology.

[[John Locke]] incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.

The Belgian philosopher of law [[Frank van Dun]] is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm|author=van Dun, Frank|accessdate=28 December 2007|title=Natural Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; of natural law in the liberal tradition. There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohen (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "human rights" has replaced the term "[[natural rights]]" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring [[natural law]] for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weston, Burns H.|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106289?query=human%20rights&amp;ct=eb|title=Human Rights|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Online, p. 2|accessdate=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories of human rights===

The philosopher [[John Finnis]] argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hum-rts.htm#SH4b|title=Human Rights|encyclopedia=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=Fagan, Andrew|year=2006|accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finnis (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest:

{{quote|Human rights law, applied to a State's own citizens serves the interest of states, by, for example, minimizing the risk of violent resistance and protest and by keeping the level of dissatisfaction with the government manageable|||Niraj Nathwani in ''Rethinking refugee law''&lt;ref&gt;Nathwani (2003) p.25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Biology|biological]] theory considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and [[altruism]] in the context of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnhart (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Schloss (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Miller, Paul (2001): Arnhart, Larry. ''Thomistic Natural Law as Darwinian Natural Right'' p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts in human rights==

===Indivisibility and categorization of rights===

The most common categorization of human rights is to split them into civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights.

Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICCPR. Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICESCR. The UDHR included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:

{{quote|The ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights, as well as his social, economic and cultural rights|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, 1966}}

This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights (known as the ''full belly thesis'')

Although accepted by the signaturies to the UDHR, most of them do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work, to education, health and housing. For example, in the United States there is no [[Universal health care|universal access to healthcare]] free at the point of use.&lt;ref&gt;Light (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; That is not to say that Western cultures have overlooked these rights entirely (the welfare states that exist in Western Europe are evidence of this). Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.

Another categorization, offered by [[Karel Vasak]], is that there are ''[[three generations of human rights]]'': first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity. Human rights expert [[Philip Alston]] argues:

{{quote|If every possible human rights element is deemed to be essential or necessary, then nothing will be treated as though it is truly important.|Philip Alston&lt;ref name="Alston 2005"&gt;Alston (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He, and others, urge caution with prioritisation of rights:

{{quote|...the call for prioritizing is not to suggest that any obvious violations of rights can be ignored.|Philip Alston&lt;ref name="Alston 2005"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Priorities, where necessary, should adhere to core concepts (such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization) and principles (such as non-discrimination, equality and participation.|Olivia Ball, Paul Gready&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready. (2007) p.42&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some human rights are said to be "[[inalienable rights]]."  The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to "a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered."

The adherence to the principle of indivisibility by the international community was reaffirmed in 1995:

{{quote|All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and related. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis.|Vienna Declaration and Program of Action, World Conference on Human Rights, 1995}}

This statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).

===Universalism vs cultural relativism===

{{main|Cultural relativism|Moral relativism|Moral universalism|Universal ethic}}

[[File:Fgm map.gif|right|thumb|Map: Estimated Prevalence of Female Genital Cutting (FGC) in Africa. Data based on uncertain estimates.]]

The UDHR enshrines, by definition, rights that apply to all humans equally, whichever geographical location, state, race or culture they belong to.

Proponents of cultural relativism suggest that human rights are not all universal, and indeed conflict with some cultures and threaten their survival.

Rights which are most often contested with relativistic arguments are the rights of women. For example, [[Female genital mutilation]] occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America. It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures. It is considered a violation of women's and girl's rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries.

Universalism has been described by some as cultural, economic or political imperialism. In particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically liberal outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, Japan or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.

For example, in 1981, the Iranian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Littman1999"&gt;Littman (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The former Prime Ministers of Singapore, [[Lee Kuan Yew]], and of [[Malaysia]], [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] both claimed in the 1990s that ''Asian values'' were significantly different from western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy. This view is countered by Mahathir's former deputy:

{{quote|To say that freedom is Western or unAsian is to offend our traditions as well as our forefathers, who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices.|[[Anwar Ibrahim]] in his keynote speech to the Asian Press Forum title ''Media and Society in Asia'', 2 December 1994}}

and also by Singapore's opposition leader [[Chee Soon Juan]] who states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Rights: Dirty Words in Singapore|publisher=Activating Human Rights and Diversity Conference (Byron Bay, Australia)|date=3 July 2003|author=Chee, S.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An appeal is often made to the fact that influential human rights thinkers, such as [[John Locke]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], have all been Western and indeed that some were involved in the running of Empires themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Tunick (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beate (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relativistic arguments tend to neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures, dating back no further than the UDHR in 1948. They also don't account for the fact that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions, including a US Roman Catholic, a Chinese Confucian philosopher, a French Zionist and a representative from the Arab League, amongst others, and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Ball, Gready 2007 p.34"/&gt;

[[Michael Ignatieff]] has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses, and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatief, M. (2001) p.68&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.

Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable. The [[2005 World Summit]] reaffirmed the international community's adherence to this principle:

{{quote|The universal nature of human rights and freedoms is beyond question.|2005 World Summit, paragraph 120}}

===State and non-state actors===

Companies, NGOs, political parties, informal groups, and individuals are known as ''non-State actors''. Non-State actors can also commit human rights abuses, but are not subject to human rights law other than International Humanitarian Law, which applies to individuals.

[[Multinational corporation|Multi-national companies]] play an increasingly large role in the world, and are responsible for a large number of human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/special/corporations.html|title=Corporations and Human Rights|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multi-national companies is both controversial and ill-defined. Multi-national companies' primary responsibility is to their [[shareholders]], not to those affected by their actions. Such companies are often larger than the economies of the states in which they operate, and can wield significant economic and political power. No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behavior of companies with regard to human rights, and national legislation is very variable. [[Jean Ziegler]], Special Rapporteur of the UN [[Commission on Human Rights]] on the right to food stated in a report in 2003:

{{quote|the growing power of transnational corporations and their extension of power through privatization, deregulation and the rolling back of the State also mean that it is now time to develop binding legal norms that hold corporations to human rights standards and circumscribe potential abuses of their position of power.|Jean Ziegler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=8536&amp;Cr=right&amp;Cr1=food|title=Transnational corporations should be held to human rights standards – UN expert|accessdate=2008-01-03|date=13 October 2003|publisher=UN News Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August 2003 the Human Rights Commission's Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights produced draft ''Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/E.CN.4.Sub.2.2003.12.Rev.2.En.|title=Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights|publisher=UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were considered by the Human Rights Commission in 2004, but have no binding status on corporations and are not monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT TO THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL ON THE SIXTIETH SESSION OF THE COMMISSION (E/CN.4/2004/L.11/Add.7)|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/e06a5300f90fa0238025668700518ca4/169143c3c1009015c1256e830058c441/$FILE/G0413976.pdf|page=81|publisher=United Nations Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights vs national security===

{{see also|National security|Anti-terrorism legislation|War on terror}}

Realism and national loyalties have been described as a destructive influence on the human rights movement because they deny people's innately similar human qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Klitou, Demetrius ''The Friends and Foes of Human Rights'' (ebook)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of non-derogable human rights (international conventions class the right to life, the right to be free from slavery, the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of penal laws as non-derogable&lt;ref name=resourceII&gt;{{cite web|title=The Resource Part II: Human Rights in Times of Emergencies|url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/comp210.htm#10.2|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the UN recognises that human rights can be limited or even pushed aside during times of national emergency – although

{{quote|the emergency must be actual, affect the whole population and the threat must be to the very existence of the nation. The declaration of emergency must also be a last resort and a temporary measure|||United Nations. ''The Resource''&lt;ref name=resourceII/&gt;}}

Rights that cannot be derogated for reasons of national security in any circumstances are known as [[Peremptory norm|peremptory norms or ''jus cogens'']]. Such International law obligations are binding on all states and cannot be modified by treaty.

===Legal instruments and jurisdiction===
[[File:International Criminal Court logo.svg|thumb|The official logo of the ICC]]

The human rights enshrined in the UDHR, the Geneva Conventions and the various enforced treaties of the United Nations are enforceable in law. In practice, many rights are very difficult to legally enforce due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights, the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them.

There exist a number of internationally recognized organisations with worldwide mandate or [[jurisdiction]] over certain aspects of human rights:

*The [[International Court of Justice]] is the United Nations' primary judiciary body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icj-cij.org/|title=Cour internationale de Justice – International Court of Justice &amp;#124; International Court of Justice|website=icj-cij.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has worldwide [[Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice|jurisdiction]]. It is directed by the [[International Court of Justice#The ICJ and the Security Council|Security Council]]. The ICJ settles disputes between nations. The ICJ does not have jurisdiction over individuals.
*The [[International Criminal Court]] is the body responsible for investigating and punishing [[war crimes]], and [[Crimes against humanity]] when such occur within its jurisdiction, with a mandate to bring to justice perpetrators of such crimes that occurred after its creation in 2002. A number of UN members have not joined the court and the ICC does not have jurisdiction over their citizens, and others have signed but not yet ratified the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], which established the court.&lt;ref name=untreaty&gt;United Nations.  ''Multilateral treaties deposited with the Secretary-General: [http://untreaty.un.org/ENGLISH/bible/englishinternetbible/partI/chapterXVIII/treaty11.asp Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court'']. Retrieved 8 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICC and other international courts (see [[Human rights#Regional human rights|Regional human rights above]] exist to take action where the national legal system of a state is unable to try the case itself. If national law is able to safeguard human rights and punish those who breach human rights legislation, it has primary jurisdiction by complementarity. Only when all ''local remedies'' have been exhausted does international law take effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Resource Part II: The International Human Rights System|url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/comp201.htm#1.1|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In over 110 countries [[National human rights institutions]] (NHRIs) have been set up to protect, promote or monitor human rights with jurisdiction in a given country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhri.net/|title=National Human Right Institutions Forum – An international forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of national human rights|access-date=6 September 2007|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020915131117/http://www.nhri.net/|archive-date=15 September 2002|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not all NHRIs are compliant with the Paris Principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhri.net/2007/List_Accredited_NIs_Nov_2007.pdf|title=Chart of the Status of National Institutions|publisher=National Human Rights Institutions Forum|quote=ACCREDITED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS&lt;br /&gt;In accordance with the Paris Principles and the ICC Sub-Committee Rules of Procedure, the following classifications for accreditation are used by the ICC:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: Compliance with the Paris Principles;&lt;br /&gt;A(R): Accreditation with reserve – granted where insufficient documentation is submitted to confer A status;&lt;br /&gt;B: Observer Status – Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination;&lt;br /&gt;C: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles.|date=November 2007|accessdate=6 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216052314/http://www.nhri.net/2007/List_Accredited_NIs_Nov_2007.pdf|archive-date=16 February 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number and effect of these institutions is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huridocs.org/|title=HURIDOCS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paris Principles]] were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Paris on 7–9 October 1991, and adopted by United Nations Human Rights Commission Resolution 1992/54 of 1992 and the General Assembly Resolution 48/134 of 1993. The Paris Principles list a number of responsibilities for national institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"National Human Rights Institutions – Implementing Human Rights", Executive Director Morten Kjærum, The Danish Institute for Human Rights, 2003. {{ISBN|87-90744-72-1}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Universal jurisdiction]] is a controversial principle in international law whereby states claim criminal jurisdiction over persons whose alleged crimes were committed outside the boundaries of the prosecuting state, regardless of nationality, country of residence, or any other relation with the prosecuting country. The state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all, which any state is authorized to punish. The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are [[erga omnes]], or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of [[jus cogens]]. In 1993 [[Belgium]] passed a ''law of universal jurisdiction'' to give its courts jurisdiction over crimes against humanity in other countries, and in 1998 [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London following an indictment by Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzon]] under the universal jurisdiction principle.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.70&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is supported by [[Amnesty International]] and other [[List of human rights organisations|human rights organisations]] as they believe certain crimes pose a threat to the international community as a whole and the community has a moral duty to act, but others, including [[Henry Kissinger]] (who has himself been accused of war crimes by several commentators&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/intljustice/wanted/kissingerindex.htm|title=Henry Kissenger|accessdate=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0611-03.htm|title=Gee, Marcus|date=11 June 2002|publisher=Toronto Globe &amp; Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;), argue that [[state sovereignty]] is paramount, because breaches of rights committed in other countries are outside states' sovereign interest and because states could use the principle for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pitfall of Universal Jurisdiction|journal=Foreign Affairs|author=Kissinger, Henry|date=July–August 2001|volume=80|issue=4|pages=86|doi=10.2307/20050228|jstor=20050228|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|access-date=6 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114024521/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|archive-date=14 January 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;span id="Violations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Human rights violations ===
{{see also|Genocides in history}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}'''Human rights violations''' occur when any state or non-state actor breaches any of the terms of the UDHR or other international human rights or humanitarian law. In regard to human rights violations of United Nations laws. Article 39 of the [[United Nations Charter]] designates the UN [[Security Council]] (or an appointed authority) as the only tribunal that may determine UN human rights violations.

Human rights abuses are monitored by United Nations committees, national institutions and governments and by many independent [[non-governmental organizations]], such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[World Organisation Against Torture]], [[Freedom House]], [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] and [[Anti-Slavery International]]. These organisations collect evidence and documentation of human rights abuses and apply pressure to promote human rights

Wars of aggression, [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]], including [[genocide]], are breaches of [[International humanitarian law]].

'''''Nous''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|n|aʊ|s}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles|edition=3 |page=1417|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|n|uː|s}}), sometimes equated to [[intellect]] or [[intelligence]], is a term from classical [[philosophy]] for the faculty of the human [[mind]] necessary for understanding what is [[truth|true]] or [[reality|real]]. English words such as "[[understanding]]" are sometimes used, but three commonly used philosophical terms come directly from classical languages: [[wiktionary:νοῦς|''νοῦς'']] or [[wiktionary:νόος|''νόος'']] (from [[Ancient Greek]]), ''[[wikt:intellectus|intellēctus]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:intellegentia|intellegentia]]'' (from [[Latin]]). To describe the activity of this faculty, the word "intellection" is sometimes used in philosophical contexts, as well as the Greek words ''noēsis'' and ''noeîn'' (''[[wiktionary:νόησις|νόησις]]'', [[wiktionary:νοεῖν|''νοεῖν'']]). This activity is understood in a similar way (at least in some contexts) to the modern concept of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]].

In philosophy, common English translations include "understanding" and "mind"; or sometimes  "[[thought]]" or "[[reason]]" (in the sense of that which reasons, not the activity of reasoning).&lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος]'' in [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dintellectus2 intellectus]'' in [[Lewis &amp; Short]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often described as something equivalent to [[perception]] except that it works within the mind ("the [[mind's eye]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature|last=Rorty|first=Richard|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1979}} page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the basic meaning is something like "awareness".&lt;ref&gt;"This quest for the beginnings proceeds through sense perception, reasoning, and what they call noesis, which is literally translated by "understanding" or intellect," and which we can perhaps translate a little bit more cautiously by "awareness," an awareness of the mind's eye as distinguished from sensible awareness." {{citation|chapter=Progress or Return|title=An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss| editor=Hilail Gilden |publication-place= Detroit|publisher=Wayne State UP|year=1989|last=Strauss|first=Leo}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In colloquial [[British English]], ''nous'' also denotes "[[good sense]]", which is close to one everyday meaning it had in [[Ancient Greece]].

[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|250px|upright=2.0|This diagram shows the medieval understanding of [[celestial spheres|spheres]] of the [[cosmos]], derived from [[Aristotle]], and as per the standard explanation by [[Ptolemy]]. It came to be understood that at least the outermost sphere (marked "[[Primum Mobile|Primũ Mobile]]") has its own intellect, intelligence or ''nous'' - a cosmic equivalent to the human mind.]]
In [[Aristotle]]'s influential works, the term was carefully distinguished from sense perception, imagination, and reason, although these terms are closely inter-related. The term was apparently already singled out by earlier philosophers such as [[Parmenides]], whose works are largely lost. In post-Aristotelian discussions, the exact boundaries between perception, understanding of perception, and reasoning have not always agreed with the definitions of Aristotle, even though his terminology remains influential.

In the Aristotelian scheme, ''nous'' is the basic understanding or awareness that allows human beings to think rationally. For Aristotle, this was distinct from the processing of sensory perception, including the use of imagination and memory, which other animals can do. This therefore connects discussion of ''nous'' to discussion of how the human mind sets definitions in a consistent and communicable way, and whether people must be born with some innate potential to understand the same [[universals|universal]] [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] in the same logical ways. Deriving from this it was also sometimes argued, especially in classical and medieval philosophy, that the individual ''nous'' must require help of a spiritual and divine type. By this type of account, it came to be argued that the human understanding (''nous'') somehow stems from this cosmic ''nous'', which is however not just a recipient of order, but a creator of it. Such explanations were influential in the development of medieval accounts of [[God]], the [[immortality of the soul]], and even the [[Celestial spheres|motions of the stars]], in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, amongst both eclectic philosophers and authors representing all the major faiths of their times.

==Pre-Socratic usage==
[[File:Jacques-Louis David - The Anger of Achilles - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|The earliest surviving text that uses the word ''nous'' is the ''[[Iliad]]''. [[Agamemnon]] says to [[Achilles]]: "Do not thus, mighty though you are, godlike Achilles, seek to deceive me with your wit (''nous''); for you will not get by me nor persuade me."&lt;ref&gt;This is from [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D130 I.130], the translation is by A.T. Murray, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In early Greek uses, [[Homer]] used ''nous'' to signify mental activities of both [[Human|mortal]]s and immortals, for example what they really have on their mind as opposed to what they say aloud. It was one of several words related to thought, thinking, and perceiving with the mind. In [[pre-Socratic philosophy]], it became increasingly distinguished as a source of knowledge and reasoning opposed to mere sense perception or thinking influenced by the body such as emotion. For example, [[Heraclitus]] complained that "much learning does not teach ''nous''".&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{citation |title=Nous|last=Long|first=A.A.|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/A075.htm| year=1998|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among some Greek authors, a faculty of intelligence known as a "higher mind" came to be considered as a property of the [[cosmos]] as a whole.

The work of [[Parmenides]] set the scene for Greek philosophy to come and the concept of ''nous'' was central to his radical proposals. He claimed that reality as the senses perceive it is not a world of truth at all, because sense perception is so unreliable, and what is perceived is so uncertain and changeable. Instead he argued for a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] wherein ''nous'' and related words (the verb for thinking which describes its mental perceiving activity, ''noein'', and the unchanging and eternal objects of this perception, ''noēta'') describe a form of perception which is not physical, but intellectual only, distinct from sense perception and the objects of sense perception.
[[File:Anaxagoras Lebiedzki Rahl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anaxagoras]]]]
[[Anaxagoras]], born about 500 BC, is the first person who is definitely known to have explained the concept of a ''nous'' (mind), which arranged all other things in the cosmos in their proper order, started them in a rotating motion, and continuing to control them to some extent, having an especially strong connection with living things. (However Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher, [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae]], who had taken a similar position.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.4.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+1.984b 984b].&lt;/ref&gt;) Amongst the pre-Socratic philosophers before Anaxagoras, other philosophers had proposed a similar ordering human-like principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens. For example, [[Empedocles]], like [[Hesiod]] much earlier, described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of [[love]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}} Chapter X.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pythagoras]] and Heraclitus, attributed the cosmos with "reason" (''[[logos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pages 204 and 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Anaxagoras the [[cosmos]] is made of infinitely divisible matter, every bit of which can inherently become anything, except Mind (''nous''), which is also matter, but which can only be found separated from this general mixture, or else mixed into living things, or in other words in the Greek terminology of the time, things with a soul (''psychē'').&lt;ref name=KirkRavenXII&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}} Chapter XII.&lt;/ref&gt; Anaxagoras wrote:
{{quote|All other things partake in a portion of everything, while ''nous'' is infinite and self-ruled, and is mixed with nothing, but is alone, itself by itself. For if it were not by itself, but were mixed with anything else, it would partake in all things if it were mixed with any; for in everything there is a portion of everything, as has been said by me in what goes before, and the things mixed with it would hinder it, so that it would have power over nothing in the same way that it has now being alone by itself. For it is the thinnest of all things and the purest, and it has all knowledge about everything and the greatest strength; and ''nous'' has power over all things, both greater and smaller, that have soul [''psychē''].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/ancient-greece/anaxagoras-nous.asp Anaxagoras, DK B 12], trans. by J. Burnet&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Concerning [[cosmology]], Anaxagoras, like some Greek philosophers already before him, believed the cosmos was revolving, and had formed into its visible order as a result of such revolving causing a separating and mixing of different types of [[chemical element]]s. ''Nous'', in his system, originally caused this revolving motion to start, but it does not necessarily continue to play a role once the mechanical motion has started. His description was in other words (shockingly for the time) corporeal or mechanical, with the [[moon]] made of earth, the sun and stars made of red hot metal (beliefs Socrates was later accused of holding during his trial) and ''nous'' itself being a physical fine type of matter which also gathered and concentrated with the development of the cosmos. This ''nous'' (mind) is not incorporeal; it is the thinnest of all things. The distinction between ''nous'' and other things nevertheless causes his scheme to sometimes be described as a peculiar kind of dualism.&lt;ref name=KirkRavenXII/&gt;

Anaxagoras' concept of ''nous'' was distinct from later platonic and neoplatonic cosmologies in many ways, which were also influenced by [[Eleatics|Eleatic]], [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and other pre-Socratic ideas, as well as the Socratics themselves.

In some schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], a "higher mind" came to be considered a property of the cosmos as a whole that exists within all matter (known as buddhi or mahat). In [[Samkhya]], this faculty of intellect ([[buddhi]]) serves to differentiate matter ([[prakrti]]) from pure consciousness ([[purusha]]). The lower aspect of mind that corresponds to the senses is referred to as "[[Manas-vijnana|manas]]".

==Socratic philosophy==

===Xenophon===
[[Xenophon]], the less famous of the two students of Socrates whose written accounts of him have survived, recorded that he taught his students a kind of [[teleological]] justification of piety and respect for divine order in nature. This has been described as an [[teleological argument|"intelligent design" argument]] for the existence of God, in which nature has its own ''nous''.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{citation|title=The Religion of Socrates| first=Mark |last= McPherran|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWfQx1CjZl0C&amp;pg=PA274|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press}}, pp. 273-275; and {{citation|title=Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity|first=David|last=Sedley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgRuJEfzUG8C|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press}}. It has been claimed that his report might be the earliest report of such an argument in {{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKewlVwJ9rgC&amp;pg=PA27|page=27|title=Socrates: A Guide for the Perplexed| first=Sara |last=Ahbel-Rappe}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in his ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' 1.4.8, he describes Socrates asking a friend sceptical of religion, "Are you, then, of the opinion that intelligence (''nous'') alone exists nowhere and that you by some good chance seized hold of it, while—as you think—those surpassingly large and infinitely numerous things [all the earth and water] are in such orderly condition through some senselessness?" Later in the same discussion he compares the ''nous'', which directs each person's body, to the good sense (''[[phronēsis]]'') of the god, which is in everything, arranging things to its pleasure (1.4.17).&lt;ref&gt;The translation quoted is from Amy Bonnette. {{citation |last=Xenophon|title=Memorabilia|year=1994|publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato describes Socrates making the same argument in his ''[[Philebus]]'' 28d, using the same words ''nous'' and ''phronēsis''.&lt;ref&gt;On the [[Perseus Project]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Asection%3D28d 28d]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato===
{{Platonism}}
{{see also|Phaedo|Timaeus (dialogue)}}
[[Plato]] used the word ''nous'' in many ways that were not unusual in the everyday Greek of the time, and often simply meant "good sense" or "awareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kalkavage|chapter=Glossary|title=Plato's Timaeus|year=2001|publisher=Focus Publishing}}. In ancient Greek the word was used for phrases such as "keep in mind" and "to my mind".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in some of his [[Platonic dialogue]]s it is described by key characters in a higher sense, which was apparently already common. In his ''[[Philebus]]'' 28c he has Socrates say that "all philosophers agree—whereby they really exalt themselves—that mind (''nous'') is king of heaven and earth. Perhaps they are right." and later states that the ensuing discussion "confirms the utterances of those who declared of old that mind (''nous'') always rules the universe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D28 28c] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D30 30d]. Translation by Fowler.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', Plato gives the [[etymology]] of [[Athena]]'s name, the goddess of wisdom, from ''Atheonóa'' (Ἀθεονόα) meaning "god's (''theos'') mind (''nous'')". In his ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato's teacher Socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of Anaxagoras' concept of a cosmic ''nous'' as the cause of the order of things, was an important turning point for him. But he also expressed disagreement with Anaxagoras' understanding of the implications of his own doctrine, because of Anaxagoras' [[materialism|materialist]] understanding of [[Causality|causation]]. Socrates said that Anaxagoras would "give voice and air and hearing and countless other things of the sort as causes for our talking with each other, and should fail to mention the real causes, which are, that the Athenians decided that it was best to condemn me".&lt;ref&gt;Fowler translation of the ''Phaedo'' as on the Perseus webpage: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D97 97]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D98 98].&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Socrates seems to suggest that he also failed to develop a fully satisfactory [[teleological]] and [[dualism (philosophy)|dualistic]] understanding of a mind of nature, whose aims represent [[the Good]], which all parts of nature aim at.

Concerning the ''nous'' that is the source of understanding of individuals, Plato is widely understood to have used ideas from [[Parmenides]] in addition to Anaxagoras. Like Parmenides, Plato argued that relying on sense perception can never lead to true knowledge, only opinion. Instead, Plato's more philosophical characters argue that ''nous'' must somehow perceive truth directly in the ways gods and [[Daimon#In classical and Hellenistic philosophy|daimons]] perceive. What our mind sees directly in order to really understand things must not be the constantly changing material things, but unchanging entities that exist in a different way, the so-called "[[theory of forms|forms]]" or "[[idea]]s". However he knew that contemporary philosophers often argued (as in modern science) that ''nous'' and perception are just two aspects of one physical activity, and that perception is the source of knowledge and understanding (not the other way around).

Just exactly how Plato believed that the ''nous'' of people lets them come to understand things in any way that improves upon sense perception and the kind of thinking which animals have, is a subject of long running discussion and debate. On the one hand, in the ''Republic'' Plato's Socrates, in the [[Analogy of the sun]] and [[Allegory of the Cave]] describes people as being able to perceive more clearly because of something from outside themselves, something like when the sun shines, helping eyesight. The source of this illumination for the intellect is referred to as the [[Form of the Good]]. On the other hand, in the ''[[Meno]]'' for example, Plato's Socrates explains the theory of ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'' whereby people are born with ideas already in their soul, which they somehow remember from [[reincarnation|previous lives]]. Both theories were to become highly influential.

As in Xenophon, Plato's Socrates frequently describes the soul in a political way, with ruling parts, and parts that are by nature meant to be ruled. ''Nous'' is associated with the rational (''logistikon'') part of the individual human soul, which by nature should rule. In his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', in the so-called "[[analogy of the divided line]]", it has a special function within this rational part. Plato tended to treat ''nous'' as the only immortal part of the [[soul]].

Concerning the cosmos, in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', the title character also tells a "likely story" in which ''nous'' is responsible for the creative work of the [[demiurge]] or maker who brought rational order to our universe. This craftsman imitated what he perceived in the world of eternal [[substantial form|Forms]]. In the ''[[Philebus]]'' Socrates argues that ''nous'' in individual humans must share in a cosmic ''nous'', in the same way that human bodies are made up of small parts of the elements found in the rest of the universe. And this ''nous'' must be in the ''[[genos]]'' of being a cause of all particular things as particular things.&lt;ref&gt;''Philebus'' on the Perseus Project: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D23 23b]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D30 30e]. Translation is by Fowler.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
{{see also|Dianoia|Active Intellect}}
{{The Works of Aristotle}}
Like Plato, Aristotle saw the ''nous'' or [[intellect]] of an individual as somehow similar to sense perception but also distinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#Glo Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Aristotle's Ethics, Glossary of terms].&lt;/ref&gt; Sense perception in [[actuality|action]] provides images to the ''nous'', via the "''[[Common sense#Aristotelian common sense|sensus communis]]''" and imagination, without which thought could not occur. But other animals have ''sensus communis'' and imagination, whereas none of them have ''nous''.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' Book III, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotelians divide perception of forms into the animal-like one which perceives ''species sensibilis'' or ''sensible forms'', and ''species intelligibilis'' that are perceived in a different way by the ''nous''.

Like Plato, Aristotle linked ''nous'' to ''logos'' (reason) as uniquely human, but he also distinguished ''nous'' from ''logos'', thereby distinguishing the faculty for setting definitions from the faculty that uses them to reason with.&lt;ref&gt;"Intelligence (''nous'') apprehend each definition (''horos'' meaning "boundary"), which cannot be proved by reasoning". ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1142a&amp;highlight=nou%3Ds%2Cnw%3D 1142a], Rackham translation.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Nicomachean ethics#Book VI: Intellectual virtue|Book VI]] Aristotle divides the soul (''psychē'') into two parts, one which has reason and one which does not, but then divides the part which has reason into the reasoning (''logistikos'') part itself which is lower, and the higher "knowing" (''epistēmonikos'') part which contemplates general principles (''archai''). ''Nous'', he states, is the source of the first principles or sources (''archai'') of definitions, and it develops naturally as people gain experience.&lt;ref&gt;This is also discussed by him in the ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt; This he explains after first comparing the four other [[truth]] revealing capacities of soul: technical [[know how]] (''[[techne|technē]]''), [[logic]]ally [[Deductive reasoning|deduced]] [[knowledge]] (''[[episteme|epistēmē]]'', sometimes translated as "scientific knowledge"), practical wisdom (''[[phronesis|phronēsis]]''), and lastly [[theory|theoretical]] [[wisdom]] (''[[sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]''), which is defined by Aristotle as the combination of ''nous'' and ''epistēmē''. All of these others apart from ''nous'' are types of reason (''logos'').
{{quote|And intellect [''nous''] is directed at what is ultimate on both sides, since it is intellect and not reason [''logos''] that is directed at both the first terms [''horoi''] and the ultimate particulars, on the one side at the changeless first terms in demonstrations, and on the other side, in thinking about action, at the other sort of premise, the variable particular; for these particulars are the sources [''archai''] from which one discerns that for the sake of which an action is, since the universals are derived from the particulars. Hence intellect is both a beginning and an end, since the demonstrations that are derived from these particulars are also about these. And of these one must have perception, and this perception is intellect.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [[Nicomachean ethics#Book VI: Intellectual virtue|VI]].xi.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1143a&amp;highlight=nou%3Ds%2Cnou%3Dn 1143a]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1143b&amp;highlight=nou%3Ds%2Cnou%3Dn 1143b].

[[Aristotle]]'s philosophical works continue many of the same Socratic themes as his teacher Plato. Amongst the new proposals he made was a way of explaining causality, and ''nous'' is an important part of his explanation. As mentioned above, Plato criticized Anaxagoras' materialism, or understanding that the intellect of nature only set the cosmos in motion, but is no longer seen as the cause of physical events. Aristotle explained that the changes of things can be described in terms of [[four causes]] at the same time. Two of these four causes are similar to the materialist understanding: each thing has a material which causes it to be how it is, and some other thing which set in motion or initiated some process of change. But at the same time according to Aristotle each thing is also caused by the natural forms they are tending to become, and the natural ends or aims, which somehow exist in nature as causes, even in cases where human plans and aims are not involved. These latter two causes (the "formal" and "final"), are concepts no longer used in modern science, and encompass the continuous effect of the intelligent ordering principle of nature itself. Aristotle's special description of causality is especially apparent in the natural development of living things. It leads to a method whereby Aristotle analyses causation and motion in terms of the [[Potentiality and actuality|potentialities and actualities]] of all things, whereby all matter possesses various possibilities or potentialities of form and end, and these possibilities become more fully real as their potential forms become actual or active reality (something they will do on their own, by nature, unless stopped because of other natural things happening). For example, a stone has in its nature the potentiality of falling to the earth and it will do so, and actualize this natural tendency, if nothing is in the way.

Aristotle analyzed thinking in the same way. For him, the possibility of understanding rests on the relationship between [[intellect]] and [[sense]] [[perception]]. Aristotle's remarks on the concept of what came to be called the "[[active intellect]]" and "[[passive intellect]]" (along with various other terms) are amongst "the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{citation |title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are derived from a single passage in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[On the Soul|''De Anima'']], Book III. Following is the translation of one of those passages&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'', Bk. III, ch. 5, 430a10-25 translated by Joe Sachs,'' Aristotle's On the Soul and On Memory and Recollection'', Green Lion Books&lt;/ref&gt; with some key Greek words shown in square brackets.
&lt;blockquote&gt;...since in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] one thing is the material [''[[matter|hulē]]''] for each kind [''[[genos]]''] (this is what is in [[potentiality|potency]] all the particular things of that kind) but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it is necessary in the soul [''[[psyche (psychology)|psychē]]''] too that these distinct aspects be present;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the one sort is intellect [''nous''] by becoming all things, the other sort by forming all things, in the way an active condition [''[[hexis]]''] like [[light]] too makes the colors that are in potency be at work as colors [''to phōs poiei ta [[dunamis|dunamei]] onta chrōmata [[energeia]]i chrōmata''].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This sort of intellect [which is like light in the way it makes potential things work as what they are] is separate, as well as being without attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a [[being-at-work]] [''energeia''], for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Knowledge]] [''epistēmē''], in its being-at-work, is the same as the thing it knows, and while knowledge in potency comes first in time in any one knower, in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is destructible), and without this nothing thinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage tries to explain "how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does" according to his distinction between potentiality and actuality.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; Aristotle says that the passive intellect receives the [[intelligible form]]s of things, but that the active intellect is required to make the potential knowledge into actual knowledge, in the same way that light makes potential colours into actual colours. As Davidson remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - terms not even explicit in the ''De anima'' and at best implied - and just how he understood the interaction between them remains moot. Students of the history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage is often read together with ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book XII, ch.7-10, where Aristotle makes ''nous'' as an actuality a central subject within a discussion of the cause of being and the cosmos. In that book, Aristotle equates active ''nous'', when people think and their ''nous'' becomes what they think about, with the "[[unmoved mover]]" of the universe, and [[God]]: "For the actuality of thought (''nous'') is life, and God is that actuality; and the essential actuality of God is life most good and eternal."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Metaphysics'' [http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052&amp;layout=&amp;loc=12.1072b 1072b].&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander of Aphrodisias, for example, equated this active intellect which is God with the one explained in ''De Anima'', while Themistius thought they could not be simply equated. (See below.)

Like Plato before him, Aristotle believes Anaxagoras' cosmic ''nous'' implies and requires the cosmos to have intentions or ends: "Anaxagoras makes the Good a principle as causing motion; for Mind (''nous'') moves things, but moves them for some end, and therefore there must be some other Good—unless it is as we say; for on our view the art of medicine is in a sense health."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D12%3Asection%3D1075b 1075]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the philosophy of Aristotle the soul ([[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]) of a body is what makes it alive, and is its actualized form; thus, every living thing, including plant life, has a soul. The mind or intellect (''nous'') can be described variously as a power, faculty, part, or aspect of the human soul. For Aristotle, soul and ''nous'' are not the same. He did not rule out the possibility that ''nous'' might survive without the rest of the soul, as in Plato, but he specifically says that this immortal ''nous'' does not include any memories or anything else specific to an individual's life. In his ''[[Generation of Animals]]'' Aristotle specifically says that while other parts of the soul come from the parents, physically, the human ''nous'', must come from outside, into the body, because it is divine or godly, and it has nothing in common with the ''energeia'' of the body.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Generation of Animals]]'' II.iii.736b.&lt;/ref&gt; This was yet another passage which Alexander of Aphrodisias would link to those mentioned above from ''De Anima'' and the ''Metaphysics'' in order to understand Aristotle's intentions.

===Post Aristotelian classical theories===
Until the early modern era, much of the discussion which has survived today concerning ''nous'' or intellect, in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, concerned how to correctly interpret Aristotle and Plato. However, at least during the classical period, materialist philosophies, more similar to modern science, such as [[Epicureanism]], were still relatively common also. The Epicureans believed that the bodily senses themselves were not the cause of error, but the interpretations can be. The term ''[[Proslepsis|prolepsis]]'' was used by Epicureans to describe the way the mind forms general concepts from sense perceptions.

To the [[Stoics]], more like Heraclitus than Anaxagoras, order in the cosmos comes from an entity called [[logos]], the [[Cosmos|cosmic]] [[reason]]. But as in Anaxagoras this cosmic reason, like human reason but higher, is connected to the reason of individual humans. The Stoics however, did not invoke incorporeal causation, but attempted to explain physics and human thinking in terms of matter and forces. As in Aristotelianism, they explained the interpretation of sense data requiring the mind to be stamped or formed with ideas, and that people have shared conceptions that help them make sense of things (''[[koine ennoia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prolepsis and Ennoia in the Early Stoa|first= Henry |last=Dyson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1AXMNpIgJ4C| year=2009| publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nous'' for them is soul "somehow disposed" (''pôs echon''), the soul being somehow disposed ''[[pneuma]]'', which is fire or air or a mixture. As in Plato, they treated ''nous'' as the ruling part of the soul.&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt;

[[Plutarch]] criticized the Stoic idea of ''nous'' being corporeal, and agreed with Plato that the soul is more divine than the body while ''nous'' (mind) is more divine than the soul.&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt; The mix of soul and body produces [[pleasure]] and [[pain]]; the conjunction of mind and soul produces [[reason]] which is the cause or the source of [[virtue]] and [[vice]]. (From: “On the Face in the Moon”)&lt;ref&gt;[[Lacus Curtius]] online text: On the Face in the Moon [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/The_Face_in_the_Moon*/D.html#28 par. 28]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albinus (philosopher)|Albinus]] was one of the earliest authors to equate Aristotle's ''nous'' as [[primum movens|prime mover]] of the Universe, with Plato's [[Form of the Good]].&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt;

====Alexander of Aphrodisias====
{{Main article|Alexander of Aphrodisias}}
[[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] was a [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] (Aristotelian) and his ''On the Soul'' (referred to as ''De anima'' in its traditional Latin title), explained that by his interpretation of Aristotle, potential intellect in man, that which has no nature but receives one from the active intellect, is material, and also called the "material intellect" (''nous hulikos'') and it is inseparable from the body, being "only a disposition" of it.&lt;ref&gt;''De anima'' 84, cited in Davidson, page 9, who translated the quoted words.&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued strongly against the doctrine of immortality.&lt;ref name=EB-alex&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Alexander of Aphrodisias |volume=1 |page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, he identified the active intellect (''nous poietikos''), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, not with anything from within people, but with the divine creator itself.&lt;ref name=EB-alex/&gt; In the early Renaissance his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] against the [[Thomists]] and the [[Averroists]].&lt;ref name=EB-alex/&gt; For him, the only possible human immortality is an immortality of a detached human thought, more specifically when the ''nous'' has as the object of its thought the active intellect itself, or another incorporeal intelligible form.&lt;ref name="Davidson p.43"&gt;Davidson p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was also responsible for influencing the development of several more technical terms concerning the intellect, which became very influential amongst the great Islamic philosophers, [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]].
*The intellect ''in habitu'' is a stage in which the human intellect has taken possession of a repertoire of thoughts, and so is potentially able to think those thoughts, but is not yet thinking these thoughts.
*The intellect from outside, which became the "acquired intellect" in Islamic philosophy, describes the incorporeal active intellect which comes from outside man, and becomes an object of thought, making the material intellect actual and active. This term may have come from a particularly expressive translation of Alexander into Arabic. Plotinus also used such a term.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, in Al-Farabi and Avicenna, the term took on a new meaning, distinguishing it from the active intellect in any simple sense - an ultimate stage of the human intellect where a kind of close relationship (a "conjunction") is made between a person's active intellect and the transcendental ''nous'' itself.

====Themistius====
{{Main article|Themistius}}
[[Themistius]], another influential commentator on this matter, understood Aristotle differently, stating that the passive or material intellect does "not employ a bodily organ for its activity, is wholly unmixed with the body, impassive, and separate [from matter]".&lt;ref&gt;Translation and citation by Davidson again, from Themistius' paraphrase of Aristotle's ''[[De Anima]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the human potential intellect, and not only the active intellect, is an incorporeal substance, or a disposition of incorporeal substance. For Themistius, the human soul becomes immortal "as soon as the active intellect intertwines with it at the outset of human thought".&lt;ref name="Davidson p.43"/&gt;

This understanding of the intellect was also very influential for [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]], and "virtually all Islamic and Jewish philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, concerning the active intellect, like Alexander and Plotinus, he saw this as a transcendent being existing above and outside man. Differently from Alexander, he did not equate this being with the first cause of the Universe itself, but something lower.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However he equated it with Plato's [[Idea of the Good]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plotinus and Neoplatonism==
{{Main article|Plotinus|Neoplatonism|Porphyry (philosopher)|Proclus}}
Of the later Greek and Roman writers [[Plotinus]], the initiator of neoplatonism, is particularly significant. Like Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius, he saw himself as a commentator explaining the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle. But in his ''[[Enneads]]'' he went further than those authors, often working from passages which had been presented more tentatively, possibly inspired partly by earlier authors such as the [[neopythagorean]] [[Numenius of Apamea]]. Neoplatonism provided a major inspiration to discussion concerning the intellect in late classical and medieval philosophy, theology and cosmology.

In neoplatonism there exists several levels or ''[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]]'' of being, including the natural and visible world as a lower part.
*The [[Monism|Monad]] or "the One" sometimes also described as "[[the Good]]", based on the concept as it is found in Plato. This is the ''[[dunamis]]'' or possibility of existence. It causes the other levels by [[Emanationism|emanation]].
*The ''Nous'' (usually translated as "Intellect", or "Intelligence" in this context, or sometimes "mind" or "reason") is described as God, or more precisely an image of God, often referred to as the ''[[Demiurge]]''. It thinks its own contents, which are thoughts, equated to the Platonic ideas or [[Theory of Forms|forms]] (''eide''). The thinking of this Intellect is the highest ''activity'' of life. The ''actualization'' (''[[energeia]]'') of this thinking is the being of the forms. This Intellect is the first principle or foundation of existence. The One is prior to it, but not in the sense that a normal cause is prior to an effect, but instead Intellect is called an [[Emanationism|emanation]] of the One. The One is the possibility of this foundation of existence.
*[[Soul]] (''psychē''). The soul is also an ''energeia'': it acts upon or ''actualizes'' its own thoughts and creates "a separate, material cosmos that is the living image of the spiritual or noetic [[Cosmos]] contained as a unified thought within the Intelligence". So it is the soul which perceives things in nature physically, which it understands to be reality. Soul in Plotinus plays a role similar to the potential intellect in Aristotelian terminology.&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt;
*Lowest is matter.
This was based largely upon Plotinus' reading of Plato, but also incorporated many Aristotelian concepts, including the [[unmoved mover]] as ''energeia''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation |chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}} and {{citation |chapter=Plotinus|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/|last=Gerson|first=Lloyd}}. The direct quote above comes from Moore.&lt;/ref&gt; They also incorporated a theory of ''anamnesis'', or knowledge coming from the past lives of our immortal souls, like that found in some of Plato's dialogues.

Later [[Platonists]] distinguished a hierarchy of three separate manifestations of ''nous'', like Numenius of Apamea had.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of The Study in Philosophy'' (1969), Vol. 5, article on subject "Nous", article author: G.B. Kerferd&lt;/ref&gt; Notable later neoplatonists include [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Proclus]].

==Medieval ''nous'' in religion==&lt;!--Linked from 'Noetics'--&gt;
Greek philosophy had an influence on the major religions that defined the [[Middle Ages]], and one aspect of this was the concept of ''nous''.

===Gnosticism===
{{Gnosticism}}
{{Main article|Gnosticism|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}
Gnosticism was a [[late antiquity|late classical]] movement that incorporated ideas inspired by neoplatonism and neopythagoreanism, but which was more a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religious movement than an accepted philosophical movement.

====Valentinus====
{{Main article|Valentinus (Gnostic)}}
In [[Valentinianism]], Nous is the first male [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]]. Together with his conjugate female Aeon, Aletheia (truth), he emanates from the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Propator Bythos]] ({{lang|grc|Προπάτωρ Βυθος}} "Forefather Depths") and his co-eternal Ennoia ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt: ἔννοια|Ἔννοια]]}} "Thought") or Sigē ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:σιγή|Σιγή]]}} "Silence"); and these four form the primordial [[Tetractys|Tetrad]]. Like the other male Aeons he is sometimes regarded as [[androgyny|androgynous]], including in himself the female Aeon who is paired with him. He is the Only Begotten; and is styled the Father, the Beginning of All, inasmuch as from him are derived immediately or mediately the remaining Aeons who complete the [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]] (eight), thence the Decad (ten), and thence the Dodecad (twelve); in all, thirty Aeons constitute the [[Pleroma]].

He alone is capable of knowing the Propator; but when he desired to impart like knowledge to the other Aeons, was withheld from so doing by Sigē. When [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] ("Wisdom"), youngest Aeon of the thirty, was brought into peril by her yearning after this knowledge, Nous was foremost of the Aeons in interceding for her. From him, or through him from the Propator, [[Valentinianism#Horos|Horos]] was sent to restore her. After her restoration, Nous, according to the providence of the Propator, produced another pair, [[Christ]] and the [[Holy Spirit]], "in order to give fixity and steadfastness ({{lang|grc|εις πήξιν και στηριγμόν}}) to the Pleroma." For this Christ teaches the Aeons to be content to know that the Propator is in himself incomprehensible, and can be perceived only through the Only Begotten (Nous).&lt;ref&gt;[[Irenaeus]], ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis]]'', I. i. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hippolytus of Rome]], ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'', vi. 29-31; [[Theodoret]], ''Haer. Fab.'' i. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Basilides====
{{Main article|Basilides}}
A similar conception of Nous appears in the later teaching of the [[Basilideans]], according to which he is the first begotten of the Unbegotten Father, and himself the parent of ''[[Logos]]'', from whom emanate successively ''[[Phronesis]]'', ''Sophia'', and ''[[potentiality and actuality|Dunamis]]''. But in this teaching, Nous is identified with Christ, is named [[Jesus]], is sent to save those that believe, and returns to Him who sent him, after a [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] which is apparent only, [[Simon of Cyrene]] being substituted for him on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Iren. I. xxiv. 4; Theod. ''H. E.'' i. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable, however, that Nous had a place in the original system of Basilides himself; for his ''Ogdoad'', "the great [[Archon]] of the universe, the ineffable"&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. vi. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; is apparently made up of the five members named by [[Irenaeus]] (as above), together with two whom we find in [[Clement of Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata|Strom]].'' iv. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dikaiosyne'' and ''Eirene'', added to the originating Father.

====Simon Magus====
{{Main article|Simon Magus}}
The antecedent of these systems is that of Simon,&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. vi. 12 ff.; Theod. I. i.&lt;/ref&gt; of whose six "roots" emanating from the Unbegotten Fire, ''Nous'' is first. The correspondence of these "roots" with the first six ''Aeons'' that Valentinus derives from ''Bythos'', is noted by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]].&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. vi. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon says in his ''[[Simonians#The Great Declaration|Apophasis Megalē]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ap. Hipp. vi. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There are two offshoots of the entire ages, having neither beginning nor end.... Of these the one appears from above, the great power, the ''Nous'' of the universe, administering all things, male; the other from beneath, the great ''[[Epinoia]]'', female, bringing forth all things.}}
To Nous and ''Epinoia'' correspond Heaven and Earth, in the list given by Simon of the six material counterparts of his six emanations. The identity of this list with the six material objects alleged by [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], i.&lt;/ref&gt; to be worshipped by the [[Persian people|Persians]], together with the supreme place given by Simon to Fire as the primordial power, leads us to look to [[history of Iran|Iran]] for the origin of these systems in one aspect. In another, they connect themselves with the teaching of [[Pythagoras]] and of Plato.

====''Gospel of Mary''====
{{Main article|Gospel of Mary}}
According to the ''Gospel of Mary'', Jesus himself articulates the essence of ''Nous'':
{{quote|"There where is the ''nous'', lies the treasure." Then I said to him: "Lord, when someone meets you in a Moment of Vision, is it through the soul [''psychē''] that they see, or is it through the spirit [''pneuma'']?" The Teacher answered: "It is neither through the soul nor the spirit, but the ''nous'' between the two which sees the vision..."|''The Gospel of Mary'', p. 10}}

===Medieval Islamic philosophy===
{{Main article|Islamic philosophy|Jewish philosophy|Averroism}}
During the [[Middle Ages]], philosophy itself was in many places seen as opposed to the prevailing monotheistic religions, [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]. The strongest philosophical tradition for some centuries was amongst Islamic philosophers, who later came to strongly influence the late medieval philosophers of western Christendom, and the [[Jewish diaspora]] in the Mediterranean area. While there were earlier Muslim philosophers such as [[Al Kindi]], chronologically the three most influential concerning the intellect were [[Al Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and finally [[Averroes]], a westerner who lived in Spain and was highly influential in the late Middle Ages amongst Jewish and Christian philosophers.

====Al Farabi====
{{Main article|Al Farabi}}
The exact precedents of Al Farabi's influential philosophical scheme, in which ''nous'' (Arabic ''[['aql|ʿaql]]'') plays an important role, are no longer perfectly clear because of the great loss of texts in the Middle Ages which he would have had access to. He was apparently innovative in at least some points. He was clearly influenced by the same late classical world as neoplatonism, neopythagoreanism, but exactly how is less clear. Plotinus, Themistius and Alexander of Aphrodisias are generally accepted to have been influences. However while these three all placed the active intellect "at or near the top of the hierarchy of being", Al Farabi was clear in making it the lowest ranking in a series of distinct transcendental intelligences. He is the first known person to have done this in a clear way.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.12-14. One possible inspiration mentioned in a commentary of Aristotle's ''[[De Anima]]'' attributed to [[John Philoponus]] is a philosopher named Marinus, who was probably a student of [[Proclus]]. He in any case designated the active intellect to be angelic or daimonic, rather than the creator itself.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first philosopher known to have assumed the existence of a causal hierarchy of [[celestial spheres]], and the incorporeal intelligences parallel to those spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.18 and p.45, which states "Within the translunar region, Aristotle recognized no causal relationship in what we may call the vertical plane; he did not recognize a causality that runs down through the series of incorporeal movers. And in the horizontal plane, that is, from each intelligence to the corresponding sphere, he recognized causality only in respect to motion, not in respect to existence."&lt;/ref&gt; Al Farabi also fitted an explanation of prophecy into this scheme, in two levels. According to Davidson (p.&amp;nbsp;59):&lt;blockquote&gt;The lower of the two levels, labeled specifically as "[[prophecy]]" (''nubuwwa''), is enjoyed by men who have not yet perfected their intellect, whereas the higher, which Alfarabi sometimes specifically names "[[revelation]]" (''w-ḥ-y''), comes exclusively to those who stand at the stage of acquired intellect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This happens in the [[imagination]] (Arabic ''mutakhayyila''; Greek ''phantasia''), a faculty of the mind already described by Aristotle, which al Farabi described as serving the rational part of the soul (Arabic ''ʿaql''; Greek ''nous''). This faculty of imagination stores sense perceptions (''maḥsūsāt''), disassembles or recombines them, creates figurative or symbolic images (''muḥākāt'') of them which then appear in dreams, visualizes present and predicted events in a way different from conscious deliberation (''rawiyya''). This is under the influence, according to Al Farabi, of the active intellect. Theoretical truth can only be received by this faculty in a figurative or symbolic form, because the imagination is a physical capability and can not receive theoretical information in a proper abstract form. This rarely comes in a waking state, but more often in dreams. The lower type of prophecy is the best possible for the imaginative faculty, but the higher type of prophecy requires not only a receptive imagination, but also the condition of an "acquired intellect", where the human ''nous'' is in "conjunction" with the active intellect in the sense of God. Such a prophet is also a philosopher. When a philosopher-prophet has the necessary leadership qualities, he becomes philosopher-king.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.58-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Avicenna====
{{Main article|Avicenna}}
In terms of cosmology, according to Davidson (p.&amp;nbsp;82) "Avicenna's universe has a structure virtually identical with the structure of Alfarabi's" but there are differences in details. As in Al Farabi, there are several levels of intellect, intelligence or ''nous'', each of the higher ones being associated with a celestial sphere. Avicenna however details three different types of effect which each of these higher intellects has, each "thinks" both the necessary existence and the possible being of the intelligence one level higher. And each "emanates" downwards the body and soul of its own celestial sphere, and also the intellect at the next lowest level. The active intellect, as in Alfarabi, is the last in the chain. Avicenna sees active intellect as the cause not only of intelligible thought and the forms in the "sublunar" world we people live, but also the matter. (In other words, three effects.)&lt;ref name=Davidson4&gt;Davidson ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the workings of the human soul, Avicenna, like Al Farabi, sees the "material intellect" or potential intellect as something that is not material. He believed the soul was incorporeal, and the potential intellect was a disposition of it which was in the soul from birth. As in Al Farabi there are two further stages of potential for thinking, which are not yet actual thinking, first the mind acquires the most basic intelligible thoughts which we can not think in any other way, such as "the whole is greater than the part", then comes a second level of derivative intelligible thoughts which could be thought.&lt;ref name=Davidson4/&gt; Concerning the actualization of thought, Avicenna applies the term "to two different things, to actual human thought, irrespective of the intellectual progress a man has made, and to actual thought when human intellectual development is complete", as in Al Farabi.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

When reasoning in the sense of deriving conclusions from [[syllogisms]], Avicenna says people are using a physical "cogitative" faculty (''mufakkira, fikra'') of the soul, which can err. The human cogitative faculty is the same as the "compositive imaginative faculty (''mutakhayyila'') in reference to the animal soul".&lt;ref&gt;From ''Shifā': De Anima'' 45, translation by Davidson p.96.&lt;/ref&gt; But some people can use "insight" to avoid this step and derive conclusions directly by conjoining with the active intellect.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a thought has been learned in a soul, the physical faculties of sense perception and imagination become unnecessary, and as a person acquires more thoughts, their soul becomes less connected to their body.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.104&lt;/ref&gt; For Avicenna, different from the normal Aristotelian position, all of the soul is by nature immortal. But the level of intellectual development does affect the type of afterlife that the soul can have. Only a soul which has reached the highest type of conjunction with the active intellect can form a perfect conjunction with it after the death of the body, and this is a supreme ''[[eudaimonia]]''. Lesser intellectual achievement means a less happy or even painful afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.111-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning prophecy, Avicenna identifies a broader range of possibilities which fit into this model, which is still similar to that of Al Farabi.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Averroes====
{{Main article|Averroes|Averroism}}
Averroes came to be regarded even in Europe as "the Commentator" to "the Philosopher", Aristotle, and his study of the questions surrounding the ''nous'' were very influential amongst Jewish and Christian philosophers, with some aspects being quite controversial. According to Herbert Davidson, Averroes' doctrine concerning ''nous'' can be divided into two periods. In the first, neoplatonic emanationism, not found in the original works of Aristotle, was combined with a naturalistic explanation of the human material intellect. "It also insists on the material intellect's having an active intellect as a direct object of thought and conjoining with the active intellect, notions never expressed in the Aristotelian canon." It was this presentation which Jewish philosophers such as [[Moses Narboni]] and [[Gersonides]] understood to be Averroes'. In the later model of the universe, which was transmitted to Christian philosophers, Averroes "dismisses emanationism and explains the generation of living beings in the sublunar world naturalistically, all in the name of a more genuine Aristotelianism. Yet it abandons the earlier naturalistic conception of the human material intellect and transforms the material intellect into something wholly un-Aristotelian, a single transcendent entity serving all mankind. It nominally salvages human conjunction with the active intellect, but in words that have little content."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.356&lt;/ref&gt;

This position, that humankind shares one active intellect, was taken up by Parisian philosophers such as [[Siger of Brabant]], but also widely rejected by philosophers such as [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Ramon Lull]], and [[Duns Scotus]]. Despite being widely considered heretical, the position was later defended by many more European philosophers including [[John of Jandun]], who was the primary link bringing this doctrine from Paris to Bologna. After him this position continued to be defended and also rejected by various writers in northern Italy. In the 16th century it finally became a less common position after the renewal of an "Alexandrian" position based on that of Alexander of Aphrodisias, associated with [[Pietro Pomponazzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson ch.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The Christian [[New Testament]] makes mention of the ''nous'' or ''noos'', generally translated in modern English as "mind", but also showing a link to God's will or law:
*{{bibleverse||Romans|7:23|KJV}}, refers to the law (''nomos'') of God which is the law in the writer's ''nous'', as opposed to the law of sin which is in the body. 
*{{bibleverse||Romans|12:2|KJV}}, demands Christians should not conform to this world, but continuously be transformed by the renewing of their ''nous'', so as to be able to determine what God’s will is.
*{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|14:14|KJV}}-{{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|14:19|KJV}}. Discusses "[[speaking in tongues]]" and says that a person who speaks in tongues that they can not understand should prefer to also have understanding (''nous''), and it is better for the listeners also to be able to understand. 
*{{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:17|KJV}}-{{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|4:23|KJV}}. Discusses how non-Christians have a worthless ''nous'', while Christians should seek to renew the spirit (''pneuma'') of their ''nous''.
*{{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:2|KJV}}. Uses the term to refer to being troubled of mind.
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|17:9|KJV}}: "here is the ''nous'' which has wisdom".

In the writings of the [[Church Fathers|Christian fathers]] a sound or pure ''nous'' is considered essential to the cultivation of [[wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the many references to ''nous'' and the necessity of its purification in the writings of the [[Philokalia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophers influencing western Christianity====
While philosophical works were not commonly read or taught in the early Middle Ages in most of Europe, the works of authors like [[Boethius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] formed an important exception. Both were influenced by neoplatonism, and were amongst the older works that were still known in the time of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], and the beginnings of [[Scholasticism]].

In his early years Augustine was heavily influenced by [[Manichaeism]] and afterwards by the Neoplatonism of [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref name="Oxford:Platonism"&gt;{{cite book | editor= Cross, Frank L. |editor2=Livingstone, Elizabeth |chapter=Platonism| title = The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-19-280290-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his conversion to Christianity and baptism (387), he developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Augustine the Theologian |last= TeSelle |first= Eugene |year= 1970 |location= London |pages= [https://archive.org/details/augustinetheolog0000tese/page/347 347–349] |isbn= 0-223-97728-4 |url= https://archive.org/details/augustinetheolog0000tese/page/347 }} March 2002 edition: {{ISBN|1-57910-918-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine]] used Neoplatonism selectively. He used both the neoplatonic ''Nous'', and the Platonic [[Form of the Good]] (or ''"The Idea of the Good"'') as equivalent terms for the Christian God, or at least for one particular aspect of God. For example, God, ''nous'', can act directly upon matter, and not only through souls, and concerning the souls through which it works upon the world experienced by humanity, some are treated as [[angels]].&lt;ref name=Menn&gt;{{citation |title=Descartes and Augustine|last=Menn|first=Stephen|publisher=University of Cambridge Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholasticism becomes more clearly defined much later, as the peculiar native type of philosophy in medieval catholic Europe. In this period, Aristotle became "the Philosopher", and scholastic philosophers, like their Jewish and Muslim contemporaries, studied the concept of the ''intellectus'' on the basis not only of Aristotle, but also late classical interpreters like Augustine and Boethius. A European tradition of new and direct interpretations of Aristotle developed which was eventually strong enough to argue with partial success against some of the interpretations of Aristotle from the Islamic world, most notably Averroes' doctrine of their being one "active intellect" for all humanity. Notable "[[Catholic]]" (as opposed to Averroist) Aristotelians included [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], the founder of [[Thomism]], which exists to this day in various forms. Concerning the ''nous'', Thomism agrees with those Aristotelians who insist that the intellect is immaterial and separate from any bodily organs, but as per Christian doctrine, the whole of the human soul is immortal, not only the intellect.

====Eastern Orthodox====
The human ''nous'' in [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] is the "eye of the heart or soul" or the "mind of the heart".&lt;ref name="Neptic Monasticism"&gt;[http://www.greekorthodoxchurch.org/neptic_monasticism.html Neptic Monasticism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/phronema/patristic-theology-romanides-chapter-1-what-is-the-human-nous.aspx "What is the Human Nous?"] by [[John Romanides]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Before embarking on this study, the reader is asked to absorb a few Greek terms for which there is no English word that would not be imprecise or misleading. Chief among these is NOUS, which refers to the `eye of the heart' and is often translated as mind or intellect. Here we keep the Greek word NOUS throughout. The adjective related to it is NOETIC (noeros)."

[[Saint]] [[Thalassius of Syria]] wrote that God created beings "with a capacity to receive the Spirit and to attain knowledge of Himself; He has brought into existence the senses and sensory perception to serve such beings". Eastern Orthodox Christians hold that God did this by creating mankind with intelligence and [[:wikt:noetic|noetic]] faculties.&lt;ref&gt;G.E.H; Sherrard, Philip; Ware, Kallistos (Timothy). The [[Philokalia]], Vol. 4 Pg432
Nous the highest facility in man, through which - provided it is purified - he knows God or the [[logos|inner essences]] or principles (q.v.) of created things by means of [[noesis|direct apprehension]] or spiritual perception. Unlike the dianoia or reason (q.v.), from which it must be carefully distinguished, the intellect does not function by formulating abstract concepts and then arguing on this basis to a conclusion reached through deductive reasoning, but it understands divine truth by means of immediate experience, intuition or 'simple cognition' (the term used by St Isaac the Syrian). The intellect dwells in the 'depths of the soul'; it constitutes the innermost aspect of the heart (St Diadochos, 79, 88: in our translation, vol. i, pp.. 280, 287). The intellect is the organ of contemplation (q.v.), the 'eye of the heart' (Makarian Homilies).&lt;/ref&gt;

Human reasoning is not enough: there will always remain an "irrational residue" which escapes analysis and which can not be expressed in concepts: it is this unknowable depth of things, that which constitutes their true, indefinable essence that also reflects the origin of things in God. In Eastern Christianity it is by faith or intuitive truth that this component of an object’s existence is grasped.&lt;ref name=lossky&gt;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, by Vladimir Lossky SVS Press, 1997, pg 33 ({{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}).

Horujy&lt;/ref&gt; Faith (''pistis'') is therefore sometimes used interchangeably with ''noesis'' in [[Eastern Christianity]].

Angels have intelligence and ''nous'', whereas men have [[reason]], both ''logos'' and ''[[dianoia]]'', ''nous'' and [[sensory perception]]. This follows the idea that man is a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] and an expression of the whole creation or [[macrocosmos]]. The human ''nous'' was darkened after the [[Fall of Man]] (which was the result of the rebellion of reason against the ''nous''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b05.en.the_illness_and_cure_of_the_soul.02.htm#Fall "The Illness and cure of the soul"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927095804/http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b05.en.the_illness_and_cure_of_the_soul.02.htm#Fall |date=2011-09-27 }} Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos&lt;/ref&gt; but after the purification (healing or correction) of the ''nous'' (achieved through ascetic practices like [[hesychasm]]), the human ''nous'' (the "eye of the heart") will [[theoria|see God's uncreated Light]] (and feel God's uncreated love and beauty, at which point the nous will start the unceasing [[prayer of the heart]]) and become illuminated, allowing the person to become an orthodox theologian.&lt;ref name="Neptic Monasticism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acrod.org/sn/sn4a.shtml The Relationship between Prayer and Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011114120/http://www.acrod.org/sn/sn4a.shtml |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://romanity.org/htm/rom.19.en.jesus_christ_the_life_of_the_world.01.htm "Jesus Christ - The Life of the World", John S. Romanides]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this belief, the soul is created in the image of God. Since God is [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]], Mankind is ''Nous'', [[reason]], both ''logos'' and ''dianoia'', and Spirit. The same is held true of the soul (or heart): it has ''nous'', word and spirit. To understand this better first an understanding of Saint [[Gregory Palamas]]'s teaching that man is a representation of the trinitarian mystery should be addressed. This holds that God is not meant in the sense that the [[Trinity]] should be understood [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphically]], but man is to be understood in a triune way.  Or, that the Trinitarian God is not to be interpreted from the point of view of individual man, but man is interpreted on the basis of the Trinitarian God. And this interpretation is revelatory not merely psychological and human. This means that it is only when a person is within the revelation, as all the saints lived, that he can grasp this understanding completely (see ''[[theoria]]''). The second presupposition is that mankind has and is composed of ''nous'', word and spirit like the trinitarian mode of being. Man's ''nous'', word and spirit are not [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]] or individual existences or realities, but activities or energies of the soul - whereas in the case with God or the Persons of the [[Holy Trinity]], each are indeed hypostases. So these three components of each individual man are 'inseparable from one another' but they do not have a personal character" when in speaking of the being or [[ontology]] that is mankind. The ''nous'' as the eye of the soul, which some Fathers also call the heart, is the centre of man and is where true (spiritual) knowledge is validated. This is seen as true knowledge which is "implanted in the ''nous'' as always co-existing with it".&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan [[Hierotheos Vlachos]] (2005), [http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b02.en.orthodox_psychotherapy.03.htm#in1 ''Orthodox Psychotherapy''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106070353/http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b02.en.orthodox_psychotherapy.03.htm#in1 |date=2009-01-06 }}, Tr.

==Early modern philosophy==
The so-called [[early modern philosophy|"early modern" philosophers]] of western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries established arguments which led to the establishment of [[modern science]] as a methodical approach to improve the welfare of [[human]]ity by learning to control nature. As such, speculation about [[metaphysics]], which cannot be used for anything practical, and which can never be confirmed against the reality we experience, started to be deliberately avoided, especially according to the so-called "[[empiricist]]" arguments of philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]]. The Latin motto "''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu''" (nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses) has been described as the "guiding principle of empiricism" in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100234623|title=nihil in intellectu nisi prius in sensu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This was in fact an old Aristotelian doctrine, which they took up, but as discussed above Aristotelians still believed that the senses on their own were not enough to explain the mind.)

These philosophers explain the intellect as something developed from experience of sensations, being interpreted by the brain in a physical way, and nothing else, which means that [[absolute knowledge]] is impossible. For Bacon, Hobbes and Locke, who wrote in both English and Latin, "''intellectus''" was translated as "understanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Martinich|page=305|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|first=Aloysius|publisher=Blackwell|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from seeing it as secure way to perceive the truth about reality, Bacon, for example, actually named the ''intellectus'' in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and the [[wikt:proœmium|proœmium]] to his ''[[Great Instauration]]'', as a major source of wrong conclusions, because it is biased in many ways, for example towards over-generalizing. For this reason, modern science should be methodical, in order not to be misled by the weak human intellect. He felt that lesser known Greek philosophers such as [[Democritus]] "who did not suppose a mind or reason in the frame of things", have been arrogantly dismissed because of Aristotelianism leading to a situation in his time wherein "the search of the physical causes hath been neglected, and passed in silence".&lt;ref&gt;Bacon ''[[Advancement of Learning]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/advancementlea00bacouoft#page/90/mode/2up/search/democritus II.VII.7]&lt;/ref&gt; The intellect or understanding was the subject of Locke's ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nidditch|first=Peter|chapter=Foreword|page=xxii|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These philosophers also tended not to emphasize the distinction between reason and intellect, describing the peculiar universal or abstract definitions of human understanding as being man-made and resulting from reason itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Thomas|last=Hobbes|title=The English Works of Thomas Hobbes|volume=3 (Leviathan) |chapter=II. Of Imagination|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=585&amp;chapter=89820&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27}} and also see ''[[De Homine]]'' X.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume even questioned the distinctness or peculiarity of human understanding and reason, compared to other types of associative or imaginative thinking found in some other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=David |last=Hume|chapter=I.III.VII (footnote) Of the Nature of the Idea Or Belief|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55095&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#lf0213_footnote_nt018|title=A Treatise of Human Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern science during this time, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] is sometimes described as more empiricist compared to Leibniz.

On the other hand, into modern times some philosophers have continued to propose that the human mind has an in-born ("''a priori''") ability to know the truth conclusively, and these philosophers have needed to argue that the human mind has direct and intuitive ideas about nature, and this means it can not be limited entirely to what can be known from sense perception. Amongst the early modern philosophers, some such as [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], tend to be distinguished from the empiricists as [[rationalists]], and to some extent at least some of them are called [[idealists]], and their writings on the intellect or understanding present various doubts about empiricism, and in some cases they argued for positions which appear more similar to those of medieval and classical philosophers.

The first in this series of modern rationalists, Descartes, is credited with defining a "[[mind-body problem]]" which is a major subject of discussion for university philosophy courses. According to the presentation his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation II: Concerning the Nature of the Human Mind: That It Is Better Known Than the Body|2nd ''Meditation'']], the human mind and body are different in kind, and while Descartes agrees with Hobbes for example that the human body works like a clockwork mechanism, and its workings include memory and imagination, the real human is the thinking being, a soul, which is not part of that mechanism. Descartes explicitly refused to divide this soul into its traditional parts such as intellect and reason, saying that these things were indivisible aspects of the soul. Descartes was therefore a [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]], but very much in opposition to traditional Aristotelian dualism. In his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation VI: Concerning the Existence of Material Things, and the Real Distinction between Mind and Body|6th ''Meditation'']] he deliberately uses traditional terms and states that his active faculty of giving ideas to his thought must be corporeal, because the things perceived are clearly external to his own thinking and corporeal, while his passive faculty must be incorporeal (unless God is deliberately deceiving us, and then in this case the active faculty would be from God). This is the opposite of the traditional explanation found for example in Alexander of Aphrodisias and discussed above, for whom the passive intellect is material, while the active intellect is not. One result is that in many Aristotelian conceptions of the ''nous'', for example that of [[Thomas Aquinas]], the senses are still a source of all the intellect's conceptions. However, with the strict separation of mind and body proposed by Descartes, it becomes possible to propose that there can be thought about objects never perceived with the body's senses, such as a [[chiliagon|thousand sided geometrical figure]]. [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] objected to this distinction between the imagination and the intellect in Descartes.&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophical Works of Descartes Vol. II, 1968, translated by Haldane and Ross, p.190&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes also objected, and according to his own philosophical approach asserted that the "triangle in the mind comes from the triangle we have seen" and "[[essence]] in so far as it is distinguished from [[existence]] is nothing else than a union of names by means of the verb is". Descartes, in his reply to this objection insisted that this traditional distinction between essence and existence is "known to all".&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophical Works of Descartes Vol. II, 1968, translated by Haldane and Ross, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Blaise Pascal]], criticised him in similar words to those used by Plato's Socrates concerning Anaxagoras, discussed above, saying that "I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkexist.com/quotation/i_cannot_forgive_descartes-in_all_his_philosophy/153298.html Think Exist on Blaise Pascal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112055348/http://thinkexist.com/quotation/i_cannot_forgive_descartes-in_all_his_philosophy/153298.html |date=2017-11-12 }}. Retrieved 12 Feb. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes argued that when the intellect does a job of helping people interpret what they perceive, not with the help of an intellect which enters from outside, but because each human mind comes into being with innate God-given ideas, more similar then, to Plato's theory of ''anamnesis'', only not requiring [[reincarnation]]. Apart from such examples as the geometrical definition of a triangle, another example is the idea of God, according to the 3rd ''Meditation''. Error, according to the 4th ''Meditation'', comes about because people make judgments about things which are not in the intellect or understanding. This is possible because the human [[will (philosophy)|will]], being free, is not limited like the human intellect.

Spinoza, though considered a Cartesian and a rationalist, rejected Cartesian dualism and idealism. In his "[[pantheistic]]" approach, explained for example in his ''Ethics'', God is the same as nature, the human intellect is just the same as the human will. The divine intellect of nature is quite different from human intellect, because it is finite, but Spinoza does accept that the human intellect is a part of the infinite divine intellect.

Leibniz, in comparison to the guiding principle of the empiricists described above, added some words ''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu'', '''''nisi intellectus ipsi''''' ("nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses" ''except the intellect itself'').&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Despite being at the forefront of modern science, and modernist philosophy, in his writings he still referred to the active and passive intellect, a divine intellect, and the immortality of the active intellect.

[[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], partly in reaction to Locke, also attempted to reintroduce an "immaterialism" into early modern philosophy (later referred to as "[[subjective idealism]]" by others). He argued that individuals can only know sensations and ideas of objects, not abstractions such as "[[matter]]", and that ideas depend on perceiving minds for their very existence. This belief later became immortalized in the dictum, ''[[esse est percipi]]'' ("to be is to be perceived"). As in classical and medieval philosophy, Berkeley believed understanding had to be explained by divine intervention, and that all our ideas are put in our mind by God.

Hume accepted some of Berkeley's corrections of Locke, but in answer insisted, as had Bacon and Hobbes, that absolute knowledge is not possible, and that all attempts to show how it could be possible have logical problems. Hume's writings remain highly influential on all philosophy afterwards, and are for example considered by Kant to have shaken him from an intellectual slumber.

Kant, a turning point in modern philosophy, agreed with some classical philosophers and Leibniz that the intellect itself, although it needed sensory experience for understanding to begin, needs something else in order to make sense of the incoming sense information. In his formulation the intellect (''Verstand'') has ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or innate principles which it has before thinking even starts. Kant represents the starting point of [[German idealism]] and a new phase of modernity, while empiricist philosophy has also continued beyond Hume to the present day.

==More recent modern philosophy and science==
One of the results of the early modern philosophy has been the increasing creation of specialist fields of science, in areas that were once considered part of philosophy, and [[infant cognitive development]] and [[perception]] now tend to be discussed more within the sciences of [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]] than in philosophy.

Modern mainstream thinking on the mind is not dualist, and sees anything innate in the mind as being a result of [[nature and nurture|genetic and developmental]] factors which allow the mind to develop. Overall it accepts far less innate "knowledge" (or clear pre-dispositions to particular types of knowledge) than most of the classical and medieval theories derived from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and Al Farabi.

Apart from discussions about the history of philosophical discussion on this subject, contemporary philosophical discussion concerning this point has continued concerning what the ethical implications are of the different alternatives still considered likely.

Classical conceptions of nous are still discussed seriously in theology. There is also still discussion of classical nous in non-mainstream metaphysics or spiritualism, such as [[Noetics]], promoted for example by the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]].

'''Reason''' is the capacity of [[Consciousness|consciously]] making sense of things, applying [[logic]], and adapting or justifying practices, [[institution]]s, and [[belief]]s based on new or existing [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/096725500750039282 | volume=8 | issue=3 | title=So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean | year=2000 | journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies | pages=271–295 | last1 = Kompridis | first1 = Nikolas}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely associated with such characteristically [[human]] activities as [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[language]], [[mathematics]], and [[art]], and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by [[humans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mercier |first1=Hugo |last2=Sperber |first2=Dan |authorlink2=Dan Sperber |date=2017 |title=The Enigma of Reason |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=9780674368309 |oclc=959650235 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zc-WDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 2] |ref=harv |quote=Enhanced with reason, cognition can secure better knowledge in all domains and adjust action to novel and ambitious goals, or so the story goes.

'''Reasoning''' is associated with [[Thought|thinking]], [[cognition]], and [[intellect]]. The field of [[logic]] studies ways in which humans reason [[Logical form|formally]] through [[argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Hintikka|first=J.|title=Philosophy of logic|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346240/philosophy-of-logic|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=12 November 2013|authorlink=Jaako Hintikka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of [[logical reasoning]] (forms associated with the strict sense): [[deductive reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]], [[abductive reasoning]]; and other modes of reasoning considered more informal, such as [[intuitive reasoning]] and [[verbal reasoning]]. Along these lines, a distinction is often drawn between logical '''discursive reasoning'''&lt;!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--&gt; (reason proper), and [[Intuition (psychology)|intuitive reasoning]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/hoffmann/courses/102_1111/Aristotle_8_EN_6.pdf Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 6 – The Intellectual Virtues]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in [[mathematics]], intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a [[formal proof]], arguably the most difficult of '''formal reasoning'''&lt;!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--&gt; tasks.

Reasoning, like habit or [[intuition]], is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as [[cause]] and [[Causality|effect]], [[truth]] and [[False (logic)|falsehood]], or ideas regarding notions of [[Good and evil|good or evil]]. Reasoning, as a part of [[Executive functions|executive decision making]], is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of [[goal]]s, [[belief]]s, [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[tradition]]s, and [[institution]]s, and therefore with the capacity for [[freedom]] and [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, "What is Enlightenment?" in ''The Essential Foucault'', eds. Paul Rabinow and Nikolas Rose, New York: The New Press, 2003, 43–57. See also Nikolas Kompridis, "The Idea of a New Beginning: A Romantic Source of Normativity and Freedom," in ''Philosophical Romanticism'', New York: Routledge, 2006, 32–59; [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096725500750039282 "So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean"], ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'' 8: 3, 271–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the use of "reason" as an [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract noun]], [[Reason (argument)|a reason]] is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or [[behavior]].&lt;ref name=mw&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reason Merriam-Webster.com] Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition of reason&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.

Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, "morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by ''reason''—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does."&lt;ref&gt;Rachels, James. The Elements of Moral Philosophy, 4th ed. McGraw Hill, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychology|Psychologists]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] have attempted to study and explain [[psychology of reasoning|how people reason]], e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of [[automated reasoning]] studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. [[comparative psychology|Animal psychology]] considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.

==Etymology and related words==
In the [[English language]] and other modern [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], "reason", and related words, represent words which have always been used to translate Latin and classical Greek terms in the sense of their philosophical usage.
* The original [[Greek language|Greek]] term was {{lang|grc|"λόγος"}} ''[[wikt:logos#Greek|logos]]'', the root of the modern English word "[[logic]]" but also a word which could mean for example "speech" or "explanation" or an "account" (of money handled).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell| first2=Robert |last2=Scott|title=A Greek–English Lexicon|chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos|chapter=logos}}. For etymology of English "logic" see any dictionary such as [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic?show=0&amp;t=1296722456 the Merriam Webster entry for logic].&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a philosophical term ''logos'' was translated in its non-linguistic senses in [[Latin]] as ''[[wikt:ratio#Latin|ratio]]''. This was originally not just a translation used for philosophy, but was also commonly a translation for ''logos'' in the sense of an account of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dratio|chapter=ratio|first1=Charlton |last1=Lewis|first2= Charles |last2=Short|title=A Latin Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:raison|raison]]'' is derived directly from Latin, and this is the direct source of the English word "reason".&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;

The earliest major philosophers to publish in English, such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], and [[John Locke]] also routinely wrote in Latin and French, and compared their terms to Greek, treating the words "''logos''", "''ratio''", "''raison''" and "reason" as interchangeable. The meaning of the word "reason" in senses such as "human reason" also overlaps to a large extent with "[[rationality]]" and the adjective of "reason" in philosophical contexts is normally "[[Rationality|rational]]", rather than "reasoned" or "reasonable".&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational Merriam Webster "rational"] and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reasonable Merriam Webster "reasonable"].&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers, [[Thomas Hobbes]] for example, also used the word '''ratiocination'''&lt;!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--&gt; as a synonym for "reasoning".

==Philosophical history==
[[File:Goya Caprichos3.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco de Goya]], ''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'' (''El sueño de la razón produce monstruos''), c. 1797]]
The proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western [[philosophy]] and later western [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]], starting with classical Greece. Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason, and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]], or "self-correcting", and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Jürgen Habermas 1990"&gt;{{cite book |last=Habermas |first1=Jürgen |authorlink=Jürgen Habermas |title=The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined in different ways, at different times, by different thinkers about human nature.

===Classical philosophy===
For many classical [[philosophers]], nature was understood [[teleology|teleologically]], meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with [[Pythagoras]] or [[Heraclitus]], the cosmos is even said to have reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pp. 204 &amp; 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human [[mind]] or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (''[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]''), reason was described by [[Plato]] as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (''[[thumos]]'') and the passions. [[Aristotle]], Plato's student, defined human beings as [[rational animal]]s, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of [[human nature]]. He ''defined'' the highest human happiness or well being (''[[eudaimonia]]'') as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [[Nicomachean Ethics#Defining Happiness and the aim of the Ethics|Book 1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with [[monotheism]] and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the [[Neoplatonism|neo-platonist]] account of [[Plotinus]], the [[cosmos]] has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things, and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter-url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers, and under this influence, mainly via [[Averroes]], came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the [[renaissance]], and they remain important in [[Iranian philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;

===Subject-centred reason in early modern philosophy===

The [[early modern era]] was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason, starting in [[Europe]]. One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] understanding of human beings. Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hubert |last=Dreyfus |title=Telepistemology: Descartes' Last Stand |url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/rtf/Limits_of_Telepresence_6_99.rtf |publisher= socrates.berkeley.edu |accessdate= February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature was no longer assumed to be human-like, with its own aims or reason, and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same "[[natural law|laws of nature]]" which affect inanimate things. This new understanding eventually displaced the previous [[world view]] that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe.
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|200px|René Descartes]]
Accordingly, in the 17th century, [[René Descartes]] explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as "rational animals", suggesting instead that they are nothing more than "thinking things" along the lines of other "things" in nature. Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was, therefore, subject to doubt.

In his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge, Descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt ''all'' knowledge – ''except'' that of the mind itself in the process of thinking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason – words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, "Second Meditation".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This eventually became known as [[epistemological]] or "subject-centred" reason, because it is based on the ''knowing subject'', who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied, and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study. Breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him, Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts, such as reason and intellect, describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity.

A contemporary of Descartes, [[Thomas Hobbes]] described reason as a broader version of "addition and subtraction" which is not limited to numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=De Corpore|url=https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho21hobbgoog|last=Hobbes|first=Thomas|editor-last=Molesworth|publisher=London, J. Bohn|year=1839}}: "We must not therefore think that computation, that is, ratiocination, has place only in numbers, as if man were distinguished from other living creatures (which is said to have been the opinion of ''[[Pythagoras]]'') by nothing but the faculty of numbering; for ''magnitude, body, motion, time, degrees of quality, action, conception, proportion, speech and names'' (in which all the kinds of philosophy consist) are capable of addition and substraction {{sic}}. Now such things as we add or substract, that is, which we put into an account, we are said to ''consider'', in Greek λογίζεσθαι [''logizesthai''], in which language also συλλογίζεσθι [''syllogizesthai''] signifies to ''compute'', ''reason'', or ''reckon''."&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of reason is sometimes termed "calculative" reason. Similar to Descartes, Hobbes asserted that "No discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute knowledge of fact, past, or to come" but that "sense and memory" is absolute knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Thomas|last=Hobbes|title=The English Works of Thomas Hobbes|volume=3 (Leviathan) |chapter=VII. Of the ends, or resolutions of discourse|chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=585&amp;chapter=89830&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27}} and {{citation|first=Thomas |last=Hobbes|title=The English Works of Thomas Hobbes|volume=3 (Leviathan)|chapter=IX.

In the late 17th century, through the 18th century, [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]] developed Descartes' line of thought still further. Hume took it in an especially [[skepticism|skeptical]] direction, proposing that there could be no possibility of [[deductive reasoning|deducing]] relationships of cause and effect, and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone, even if it seems otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|chapter=XXVII On Identity and Diversity|origyear=1689|chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=761&amp;chapter=80770&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|edition=12th|year=1824|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 1|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Hume|chapter=I.IV.VI.

Hume famously remarked that, "We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Hume|chapter=II.III.III.

Of the reason of animals|chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55113&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|title=A Treatise of Human Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed from this that animals have reason, only much less complex than human reason.

In the 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] attempted to show that Hume was wrong by demonstrating that a "[[transcendental arguments|transcendental]]" self, or "I", was a necessary condition of all experience. Therefore, suggested Kant, on the basis of such a self, it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge. And so long as these limits are respected, reason can be the vehicle of morality, justice, aesthetics, theories of knowledge ([[epistemology]]), and understanding.

===Substantive and formal reason===

In the formulation of Kant, who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject, the great achievement of reason ({{lang-de|Vernunft}}) is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making. Kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral-practical, theoretical and aesthetic reasoning, on "universal" laws.

Here [[practical reason]]ing is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], and [[theory|theoretical]] reasoning the way humans posit universal [[natural law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason''; ''Critique of Practical Reason''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under practical reason, the moral [[autonomy]] or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason. This contrasted with earlier forms of morality, which depended on [[religion|religious understanding]] and interpretation, or [[nature]] for their substance.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sandel, ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'', New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant, in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit, so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason. He formulated such a principle, called the "[[categorical imperative]]", which would justify an action only if it could be universalized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|author2=translated by James W. Ellington [1785]|title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals 3rd ed.|publisher=Hackett|year=1993|page=[https://archive.org/details/groundingformet000kant/page/30 30]|isbn=978-0-87220-166-8|url=https://archive.org/details/groundingformet000kant/page/30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to Hume then, Kant insists that reason itself (German ''[[wikt:Vernunft|Vernunft]]'') has natural ends itself, the solution to the metaphysical problems, especially the discovery of the foundations of morality. Kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his "[[transcendental logic]]" which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument, which can be used indifferently, as it was for Aristotle, but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002| chapter=On Kant's Socratism|title=Being After Rousseau|publisher=University of Chicago Press}} and Kant's own first preface to ''[[The Critique of Pure Reason]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jürgen Habermas]], the "substantive unity" of reason has dissolved in modern times, such that it can no longer answer the question "How should I live?" Instead, the unity of reason has to be strictly formal, or "procedural". He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres (on the model of Kant's three critiques):

# ''Cognitive–instrumental reason'' is the kind of reason employed by the sciences. It is used to observe events, to predict and control outcomes, and to intervene in the world on the basis of its hypotheses;
# ''Moral–practical reason'' is what we use to deliberate and discuss issues in the moral and political realm, according to universalizable procedures (similar to Kant's categorical imperative); and
# ''Aesthetic reason'' is typically found in works of art and literature, and encompasses the novel ways of seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices embody.

For Habermas, these three spheres are the domain of experts, and therefore need to be mediated with the "[[lifeworld]]" by philosophers. In drawing such a picture of reason, Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason, which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life, could be made up for by the unity of reason's formalizable procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The critique of reason===

[[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]], and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means, or ought to mean. Some, like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rorty, are skeptical about subject-centred, universal, or instrumental reason, and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others, including Hegel, believe that it has obscured the importance of [[intersubjectivity]], or "spirit" in human life, and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be.

Some thinkers, e.g. Foucault, believe there are other ''forms'' of reason, neglected but essential to modern life, and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason.&lt;ref name="Jürgen Habermas 1990"/&gt;

In the last several decades, a number of proposals have been made to "re-orient" this critique of reason, or to recognize the "other voices" or "new departments" of reason:

For example, in opposition to subject-centred reason, Habermas has proposed a model of [[communicative rationality|communicative reason]] that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity, based on the fact of linguistic [[intersubjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Theory of Communicative Action: Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', translated by Thomas McCarthy. Boston: Beacon Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as "that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness" in human affairs, and a focus on reason's possibilities for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006. See also Nikolas Kompridis, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096725500750039282 "So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean"], ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'' 8:3, 271–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], influenced by the 20th century German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], has proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of [[world disclosure|disclosure]], which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life, as a new "department" of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, ''Philosophical Arguments'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), 12; 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay "What is Enlightenment?", Michel Foucault proposed a concept of critique based on Kant's distinction between "private" and "public" uses of reason. This distinction, as suggested, has two dimensions:
* ''Private reason'' is the reason that is used when an individual is "a cog in a machine" or when one "has a role to play in society and jobs to do: to be a soldier, to have taxes to pay, to be in charge of a parish, to be a civil servant".
* ''Public reason'' is the reason used "when one is reasoning as a '''reasonable'''&lt;!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA--&gt; being (and not as a cog in a machine), when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable humanity". In these circumstances, "the use of reason must be free and public."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, "What is Enlightenment?", ''The Essential Foucault'', New York: The New Press, 2003, 43–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason compared to related concepts==

===Compared to logic===
{{Main|Logic}}
The terms "logic" or "logical" are sometimes used as if they were identical with the term "reason" or with the concept of being "rational", or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason. For example in modern [[economics]], [[Rational choice theory|rational choice]] is assumed to equate to logically [[Consistency|consistent]] choice.

Reason and logic can however be thought of as distinct, although logic is one important aspect of reason. Author [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', characterizes the distinction in this way. Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Hofstadter, ''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', Vintage, 1979, {{ISBN|0-394-74502-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reason is a type of [[thought]], and the word "[[logic]]" involves the attempt to describe rules or norms by which reasoning operates, so that orderly reasoning can be taught. The oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]], especially ''Prior Analysis'' and ''Posterior Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Complete Works'' (2 volumes), Princeton, 1995, {{ISBN|0-691-09950-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason, Aristotle's [[neologism|newly coined word]] "[[syllogism]]" (''syllogismos'') identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study. When Aristotle referred to "the logical" (''hē logikē''), he was referring more broadly to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/searchresults?all_words=logiko/s&amp;all_words_expand=yes&amp;la=greek See this Perseus search, and compare English translations.] and see [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph.jsp?l=logikw%3Ds&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=le/getai&amp;d=Perseus:text:1999.01.0049:book=1:section=1217b&amp;i=1#lexicon LSJ dictionary entry for λογικός, section II.2.b.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason compared to cause-and-effect thinking, and symbolic thinking===
{{Main|Causality|Symbols}}
As pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke and Hume, some animals are also clearly capable of a type of "[[association (psychology)|associative thinking]]", even to the extent of associating causes and effects. A dog once kicked, can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future, but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Treatise of Human Nature]] of [[David Hume]], [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55113&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Book I, Part III, Sect. XVI].&lt;/ref&gt;

Human reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of [[John Locke|Locke]], for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of [[syllogism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|volume= 2|chapter=XVII Of Reason|origyear=1689|chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=762&amp;layout=html#chapter_80842|edition=12th|year=1824|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of [[symbol]]s, as well as [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|indices and icons]], according to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], the symbols having only a nominal, though habitual, connection to either smoke or fire.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Deacon, ''The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Brain'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1998, {{ISBN|0-393-31754-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is [[language]].

The connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. [[Thomas Hobbes]] described the creation of "Markes, or Notes of remembrance" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Ch. 4) as ''speech''. He used the word ''speech'' as an English version of the Greek word ''[[logos]]'' so that speech did not need to be communicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html#CHAPTERIV Leviathan Chapter IV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615025735/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html |date=2006-06-15 }}: "The Greeks have but one word, logos, for both speech and reason; not that they thought there was no speech without reason, but no reasoning without speech"&lt;/ref&gt; When communicated, such speech becomes language, and the marks or notes or remembrance are called "[[Sign (linguistics)|Signes]]" by Hobbes. Going further back, although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (''logos''), he does mention that animals with imagination, for whom sense perceptions can persist, come closest to having something like reasoning and ''[[nous]]'', and even uses the word "logos" in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason, imagination, mimesis, and memory===
{{Main|Imagination|Mimesis|Memory|Recollection}}
Reason and [[imagination]] rely on similar [[mental processes]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Imagination is not only found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that ''phantasia'' (imagination: that which can hold images or ''phantasmata'') and ''phronein'' (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Anima]]'' III.i–iii; ''On Memory and Recollection'', ''On Dreams''&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or ''logos''. But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.

The recent modern writings of [[Terrence Deacon]] and [[Merlin Donald]], writing about the [[origin of language]], also connect reason connected to not only [[language]], but also [[mimesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Mimesis in modern academic writing, starting with [[Erich Auerbach]], is a technical word, which is not necessarily exactly the same in meaning as the original Greek. See [[Mimesis]].&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically they describe the ability to create [[language]] as part of an internal modeling of [[reality]] specific to humankind. Other results are [[consciousness]], and [[imagination]] or [[fantasy]]. In contrast, modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker]], to whom Donald and Deacon can be contrasted.

As reason is symbolic thinking, and peculiarly human, then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of "icons" or images and the real things they represent. Starting with a modern author, Merlin Donald writes&lt;ref&gt;Origins of the Modern Mind p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A dog might perceive the "meaning" of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans, but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent (a real fight). [...] Trained apes are able to make this distinction; young children make this distinction early – hence, their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itself&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In classical descriptions, an equivalent description of this mental faculty is ''eikasia'', in the philosophy of Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the [[Meno]]'' Ch.5&lt;/ref&gt; This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else, related somehow but not the same, and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as ''dianoetic eikasia'' is the ''eikasia'' concerned specifically with thinking and mental images, such as those mental symbols, icons, ''signes'', and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible "objects of thought" as "foundations" (''hypothēses'' in Ancient Greek). This thinking (''dianoia'') is "...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more 'precise' ''noēta''".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such as Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of ''mimesis'', often translated as ''imitation'' or ''representation''. Donald writes&lt;ref&gt;Origins of the Modern Mind p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation is found especially in monkeys and apes [... but ...] Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations. [...] Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Mimēsis'' is a concept, now popular again in academic discussion, that was particularly prevalent in Plato's works, and within Aristotle, it is discussed mainly in the ''Poetics''. In Michael Davis's account of the theory of man in this work.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to the translation of ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' by Davis and [[Seth Benardete]] p. xvii, xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the distinctive feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...&lt;ref&gt;Davis is here using "poetic" in an unusual sense, questioning the contrast in Aristotle between action (''praxis'', the ''praktikē'') and making (''poēsis'', the ''poētikē''): "Human [peculiarly human] action is imitation of action because thinking is always rethinking. Aristotle can define human beings as at once rational animals, political animals, and imitative animals because in the end the three are the same."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Donald like Plato (and Aristotle, especially in ''On Memory and Recollection''), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek ''anamnēsis'', normally translated as "recollection" was opposed to ''mneme'' or ''memory''. Memory, shared with some animals,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [[On Memory]] 450a 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past, but also ''that'' something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of ''eikasia''&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; "...but nothing except man is able to recollect."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle Hist. Anim. I.1.488b.25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, "To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Donald calls the same thing ''autocueing'', which he explains as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''The Origins of the Modern Mind'' p. 173 see also ''A Mind So Rare'' pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; "Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues – probably the earliest form of representational ''thinking''."

In a celebrated paper in modern times, the fantasy author and philologist [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote in his essay "On Fairy Stories" that the terms "fantasy" and "enchantment" are connected to not only "....the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires...." but also "...the origin of language and of the mind".

===Logical reasoning methods and argumentation===
Looking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between [[deductive reasoning]] and [[inductive reasoning]]. [[Logic|Formal logic]] has been described as ''the science of deduction''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, Richard. 1991. ''Formal logic: its scope and limits'', (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill:1.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as [[informal logic]] or [[critical thinking]].

====Deductive reasoning====
{{Main|Deductive reasoning}}
A subdivision of [[Philosophy]] is [[Logic]].  Logic is the study of reasoning.  Deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises. A deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process.  One classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in [[syllogism]]s like the following:
* Premise 1: All humans are mortal.
* Premise 2: Socrates is a human.
* Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.

The reasoning in this argument is valid, because there is no way in which the premises, 1 and 2, could be true and the conclusion, 3, be false.

====Inductive reasoning====
{{Main|Inductive reasoning}}
Induction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types, either specifically or generally, based on previous observation. It is used to ascribe [[category of being|properties or relations]] to objects or [[type (metaphysics)|types]] based on [[event (philosophy)|previous observations or experiences]], or to formulate general statements or [[law (principle)|laws]] based on limited observations of recurring [[phenomena]]l patterns.

Inductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that, even in the best, or strongest, cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of [[probability]]. Relatedly, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.

A classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the [[empiricist]] [[David Hume]]:
* Premise: The sun has risen in the east every morning up until now.
* Conclusion: The sun will also rise in the east tomorrow.

====Analogical reasoning====
{{Main|Analogical reasoning}}
Analogical reasoning is a form of inductive reasoning from a particular to a particular. It is often used in [[case-based reasoning]], especially legal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas N. |authorlink=Douglas N. Walton |date=2014 |chapter=Argumentation schemes for argument from analogy |editor-last=Ribeiro |editor-first=Henrique Jales |title=Systematic approaches to argument by analogy |series=Argumentation library |volume=25 |location=Cham; New York |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=23–40 |isbn=978-3-319-06333-1 |oclc=884441074 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-06334-8_2|chapter-url=https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/crrarpub/15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example follows:
* Premise 1: Socrates is human and mortal.
* Premise 2: Plato is human.
* Conclusion: Plato is mortal.

Analogical reasoning is a weaker form of inductive reasoning from a single example, because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vickers |first=John |title=The Problem of Induction |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2009 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/ |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions. For example:
* Premise 1: Socrates is human and male.
* Premise 2: [[Ada Lovelace]] is human.
* Conclusion: Therefore Ada Lovelace is male.

====Abductive reasoning====
{{Main|Abductive reasoning}}
Abductive reasoning, or argument to the best explanation, is a form of reasoning that doesn't fit in deductive or inductive, since it starts with incomplete set of observations and proceeds with likely possible explanations so the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others, by subjective judgement or attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion, given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example, when a patient displays certain symptoms, there might be various possible causes, but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.

====Fallacious reasoning====
{{Main|Fallacy|Formal fallacy|Informal fallacy}}
Flawed reasoning in arguments is known as [[fallacy|fallacious reasoning]]. Bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a [[formal fallacy]] or an [[informal fallacy]].

Formal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form, or structure, of the argument. The word "formal" refers to this link to the ''form'' of the argument. An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid.

An informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the ''content'', rather than mere ''structure'', of the argument.

==Traditional problems raised concerning reason==
Philosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve [[knowledge]] of [[truth]] better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, can be expected to achieve a [[eudaimonia|happy life]] more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).

===Reason versus truth, and "first principles"===
{{See also|Truth|First principle|Nous}}
Since [[classical antiquity|classical]] times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate (which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called [[Platonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]]) concerning the role of reason in confirming [[truth]]. People use logic, [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], and [[inductive reasoning|induction]], to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered, according to Aristotle, more certain than sense perceptions on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Example: Aristotle ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D981b 981b]: τὴν ὀνομαζομένην σοφίαν περὶ τὰ πρῶτα αἴτια καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς ὑπολαμβάνουσι πάντες: ὥστε, καθάπερ εἴρηται πρότερον, ὁ μὲν ἔμπειρος τῶν ὁποιανοῦν ἐχόντων αἴσθησιν εἶναι δοκεῖ σοφώτερος, ὁ δὲ τεχνίτης τῶν ἐμπείρων, χειροτέχνου δὲ ἀρχιτέκτων, αἱ δὲ θεωρητικαὶ τῶν ποιητικῶν μᾶλλον. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D981b English]: "...what is called Wisdom is concerned with the primary causes and principles, so that, as has been already stated, the man of experience is held to be wiser than the mere possessors of any power of sensation, the artist than the man of experience, the master craftsman than the artisan; and the speculative sciences to be more learned than the productive."&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions, then, our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1009b 1009b] ποῖα οὖν τούτων ἀληθῆ ἢ ψευδῆ, ἄδηλον: οὐθὲν γὰρ μᾶλλον τάδε ἢ τάδε ἀληθῆ, ἀλλ᾽ ὁμοίως. διὸ Δημόκριτός γέ φησιν ἤτοι οὐθὲν εἶναι ἀληθὲς ἢ ἡμῖν γ᾽ ἄδηλον. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1009b English] "Thus it is uncertain which of these impressions are true or false; for one kind is no more true than another, but equally so. And hence Democritus says that either there is no truth or we cannot discover it."&lt;/ref&gt;

This leads to the question of what types of [[first principles]], or starting points of reasoning, are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions. In Greek, "[[first principles]]" are ''[[Arche|archai]]'', "starting points",&lt;ref&gt;For example Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D983a 983a]: ἐπεὶ δὲ φανερὸν ὅτι τῶν ἐξ ''ἀρχῆς'' αἰτίων δεῖ λαβεῖν ''ἐπιστήμην'' （τότε γὰρ εἰδέναι φαμὲν ἕκαστον, ὅταν τὴν ''πρώτην'' αἰτίαν οἰώμεθα ''γνωρίζειν''） [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D983a English] "It is clear that we must obtain knowledge of the ''primary'' causes, because it is when we think that we understand its ''primary'' cause that we claim to ''know'' each particular thing."&lt;/ref&gt; and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;Example: ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0053%3Abekker+page%3D1139a 1139b]: ἀμφοτέρων δὴ τῶν ''νοητικῶν'' μορίων ἀλήθεια τὸ ἔργον. καθ᾽ ἃς οὖν μάλιστα ἕξεις ἀληθεύσει ἑκάτερον, αὗται ἀρεταὶ ἀμφοῖν. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1139a English] The attainment of truth is then the function of both the ''intellectual'' parts of the soul. Therefore their respective virtues are those dispositions that will best qualify them to attain truth.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plato&lt;ref&gt;Example: Plato ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0167%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D490b 490b]: μιγεὶς τῷ ὄντι ὄντως, γεννήσας νοῦν καὶ ἀλήθειαν, γνοίη [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0094%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D490b English]: "Consorting with reality really, he would beget intelligence and truth, attain to knowledge"&lt;/ref&gt; as ''[[nous]]'' which was close in meaning to ''awareness'' or ''[[consciousness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"This quest for the beginnings proceeds through sense perception, reasoning, and what they call ''noesis'', which is literally translated by "understanding" or intellect," and which we can perhaps translate a little bit more cautiously by "awareness," an awareness of the mind's eye as distinguished from sensible awareness." "Progress or Return" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empiricism]] (sometimes associated with Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;However, the empiricism of Aristotle must certainly be doubted. For example in ''Metaphysics'' 1009b, cited above, he criticizes people who think knowledge might not be possible because, "They say that the impression given through sense-perception is necessarily true; for it is on these grounds that both [[Empedocles]] and Democritus and practically all the rest have become obsessed by such opinions as these."&lt;/ref&gt; but more correctly associated with [[Great Britain|British]] philosophers such as [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]], as well as their ancient equivalents such as [[Democritus]]) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth. This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that [[absolute knowledge]] is not attainable. [[Idealism]], (associated with Plato and his school), claims that there is a "higher" reality, from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses, and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth.

Philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Maimonides]], [[Aquinas]] and [[Hegel]] are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable—perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. In the vision of these thinkers, reason is divine or at least has divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Étienne Gilson]] to try to show that reason and [[revelation]] are compatible. According to Hegel, "...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of [[History]], is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process."&lt;ref&gt;G.W.F. Hegel [[Lectures on the Philosophy of History|''The Philosophy of History'']], p. 9, Dover Publications Inc., {{ISBN|0-486-20112-0}}; 1st ed. 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 17th century [[rationalist]]s, reason has often been taken to be a [[subjectivity|subjective faculty]], or rather the unaided ability ([[pure reason]]) to form concepts.  For [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], this was associated with [[mathematics]]. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts ([[time]] and [[space]]) that are the conditions of experience. Kant made his argument in opposition to Hume, who denied that reason had any role to play in experience.

===Reason versus emotion or passion===
{{See also|Emotion|Passion (emotion)}}
After Plato and Aristotle,  [[western literature]] often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[Stoic philosophy]] by contrast considered all passions undesirable.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} After the critiques of reason in the early Enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or conflated with the passions.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Some Enlightenment camps took after the Stoics to say Reason should oppose Passion rather than order it, while others like the Romantics believed that Passion displaces Reason, as in the maxim "follow your heart".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Reason has been seen as a slave, or judge, of the passions, notably  in the work of [[David Hume]], and more recently  of [[Freud]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Reasoning which claims that the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called ''[[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Rousseau]] first proposed, in his second ''[[Discourse on Inequality|Discourse]]'', that reason and political life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|chapter=Speech. Imagination, Origins: Rousseau and the Political Animal|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind. What, other than reason and civil society, "best suits his constitution"? Rousseau saw "two principles prior to reason" in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being, especially one like ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rousseau|chapter=Preface|title=Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men or Second Discourse|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor=Gourevitch|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other, and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to Velkley, "Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction, most notably the political legislation of the ''[[The Social Contract|Contrat Social]]'' and the moral education in ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Émile]]''. All the same, Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition, that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity."

This quandary presented by Rousseau led to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil. These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God. In various ways,  [[German Idealism]] after Kant, and major later figures such [[Nietzsche]], [[Bergson]], [[Husserl]], [[Max Scheler|Scheler]], and [[Heidegger]], remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or ''urges'' of ''reason''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|chapter=Freedom, Teleology, and Justification of Reason|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics. Many writers (such as [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]) extol passion and disparage reason. In politics modern [[nationalism]] comes from Rousseau's argument that rationalist [[cosmopolitanism]] brings man ever further from his natural state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter=Rousseau and the Origins of Nationalism|last=Plattner|first=Marc|year=1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|title=The Legacy of Rousseau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view on reason and emotion was proposed in the 1994 book titled ''[[Descartes' Error]]'' by [[Antonio Damasio]]. In it, Damasio presents the "[[Somatic marker hypothesis|Somatic Marker Hypothesis]]" which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making. Damasio argues that these somatic markers (known collectively as "gut feelings") are "intuitive signals" that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone. Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function.

===Reason versus faith or tradition===
{{Main|Faith|Religion|Tradition}}
There are many religious traditions, some of which are explicitly [[Fideism|fideist]] and others of which claim varying degrees of [[rationalism]]. Secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality, since they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring, suppressing, or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects (such as religious dogmas, moral taboos, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The God Delusion|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|year=2008|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=978-0-618-91824-9|edition=Reprint|language=English|quote=Scientists... see the fight for evolution as only one battle in a larger war: a looming war between supernaturalism on the one side and rationality on the other.|url=https://archive.org/details/goddelusion00dawk_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the [[theology|theologies]] and [[religion]]s such as [[Monotheism|classical monotheism]] typically do not claim to be [[irrationality|irrational]], there is often a perceived conflict or tension between [[faith]] and [[tradition]] on the one hand, and reason on the other, as potentially competing sources of [[wisdom]], [[law]] and [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Strauss|title=An Introduction to Political Philosophy|chapter=Progress or Return|first=Leo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|volume= 2|issue=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings |chapter=XVIII Of Faith and Reason, and their distinct Provinces.|origyear=1689|chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=762&amp;layout=html#chapter_80844|edition=12th|year=1824|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled, or have different non-overlapping domains, or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism:
* ''Reconciliation'': Philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] argues that there is no real conflict between reason and classical theism because classical theism explains (among other things) why the universe is intelligible and why reason can successfully grasp it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-981209-7|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Signs and Knowledge of God: A New Look at Theistic Arguments|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-966107-7|edition=Reprint|location=Oxford|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Non-overlapping magisteria'': Evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argues that there need not be conflict between reason and religious belief because they are each authoritative in their own domain (or "magisterium").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html|title=Nonoverlapping Magisteria|author=[[Stephen Jay Gould]] |date=1997|website=www.stephenjaygould.org|access-date=2016-04-06|quote="To say it for all my colleagues and for the umpteenth millionth time (from college bull sessions to learned treatises): science simply cannot (by its legitimate methods) adjudicate the issue of God's possible superintendence of nature.

You then realize that the presence of a creative deity in the universe is clearly a scientific hypothesis. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more momentous hypothesis in all of science.

God could clinch the matter in his favour at any moment by staging a spectacular demonstration of his powers, one that would satisfy the exacting standards of science. Even the infamous Templeton Foundation recognized that God is a scientific hypothesis — by funding double-blind trials to test whether remote prayer would speed the recovery of heart patients. It didn't, of course, although a control group who knew they had been prayed for tended to get worse (how about a class action suit against the Templeton Foundation?) Despite such well-financed efforts, no evidence for God's existence has yet appeared.|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/goddelusion00dawk_0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/goddelusion00dawk_0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, perhaps reason alone is not enough to explain such big questions as the origins of the universe, the origin of life, the origin of consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Existence-God-Routledge-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B001QA4T5A/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459966694&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=theistic+argument+from+consciousness|title=Consciousness and the Existence of God: A Theistic Argument|last=Moreland|first=J.P.|publisher=Routledge|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the foundation of morality, or the destiny of the human race.

* ''[[Tu quoque]]'': Philosophers [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] argue that those critics of traditional religion who are adherents of [[Secularity|secular]] [[liberalism]] are also sometimes guilty of ignoring, suppressing, and forbidding some kinds of reasoning about subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry: Encyclopaedia, Genealogy, and Tradition|year=1991|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|isbn=978-0-268-01877-1|edition=60067th|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secular Age|last=Taylor|first=Charles|year=2007|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02676-6|edition=1st|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, philosophers of science such as [[Paul Feyerabend|Paul Feyarabend]] argue that scientists sometimes ignore or suppress evidence contrary to the dominant [[paradigm]].
* ''Unification'': Theologian Joseph Ratzinger, later [[Benedict XVI]], asserted that "Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the Logos, as the religion according to reason," referring to John 1:Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, usually translated as "In the beginning was the Word (Logos)." Thus, he said that the Christian faith is "open to all that is truly rational", and that the rationality of Western Enlightenment "is of Christian origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/cardinal-ratzinger-on-europe-s-crisis-of-culture.html | title=Cardinal Ratzinger on Europe's Crisis of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some commentators have claimed that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between "unaided" reason and [[faith]] in "[[revelation|revealed]]" truths—figuratively summarized as [[Athens]] and [[Jerusalem]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Athens Met Jerusalem: An Introduction to Classical and Christian Thought|year=2009|publisher=IVP Academic|isbn=978-0-8308-2923-1|edition=58760th|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.amazon.com/Athens-Jerusalem-Lev-Shestov/dp/B0007FM164/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459965696&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=athens+and+jerusalem|title=Athens and Jerusalem|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=950|issue=1|page=17|last=Shestov|first=Lev|date=1968|bibcode=2001NYASA.950...17P|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb02124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Strauss]] spoke of a "Greater [[Western world|West]]" that included all areas under the influence of the tension between Greek rationalism and [[Abrahamic]] revelation, including the [[Muslim]] lands. He was particularly influenced by the great [[Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosopher]] [[Farabi|Al-Farabi]]. To consider to what extent [[Eastern philosophy]] might have partaken of these important tensions, Strauss thought it best to consider whether [[dharma]] or [[tao]] may be equivalent to [[Nature (philosophy)|Nature]] (by which we mean ''[[physis]]'' in Greek). According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the "discovery or invention of nature" and the "pre-philosophical equivalent of nature" was supplied by "such notions as 'custom' or 'ways{{' "}}, which appear to be ''really universal in all times and places''. The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding ''archai'' (first principles of knowledge) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand, and tradition or faith on the other.&lt;ref&gt;"Progress or Return" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is this special history of debate concerning reason and faith in the Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions, the pursuit of reason is sometimes argued to be compatible with the other practice of other religions of a different nature, such as [[Hinduism]], because they do not define their tenets in such an absolute way.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita'', [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]: "Hinduism is not just a faith. It is the union of reason and intuition that can not be defined but is only to be experienced."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason in particular fields of study==

===Reason in political philosophy and ethics===
{{Main|Political Philosophy|Ethics|The Good}}
[[Aristotle]] famously described reason (with language) as a part of [[human nature]], which means that it is best for humans to live "politically" meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small [[city state]] (''polis'' in Greek). For example...
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear, then, that a human being is more of a political [''politikon'' = of the ''polis''] animal [''zōion''] than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds. For nature, as we say, makes nothing in vain, and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech [''logos'']. Voice, of course, serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant; that is why it is also found in other animals, because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other. But speech [''logos''] serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust. For it is a peculiarity of humans, in contrast to the other animals, to have perception of good and bad, just and unjust, and the like; and the community in these things makes a household or city [''polis'']. [...] By nature, then, the drive for such a community exists in everyone, but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness. For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected, so they are the worst when divorced from law and right. The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons, and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue, but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses. Consequently, if a human being lacks virtue, he is the most unholy and savage thing, and when it comes to sex and food, the worst. But justice is something political [to do with the ''polis''], for right is the arrangement of the political community, and right is discrimination of what is just. ([[Aristotle's Politics]] 1253a 1.2. Peter Simpson's translation, with Greek terms inserted in square brackets.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of human nature being fixed in this way, implied, in other words, that we can define what type of community is always best for people. This argument has remained a central argument in all political, ethical and moral thinking since then, and has become especially controversial since firstly [[Rousseau]]'s Second Discourse, and secondly, the [[Theory of Evolution]]. Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the ''polis'' had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first, and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that, with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Politics I.2.1252b15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Friendship]] [''philia''] seems to prevail [in] man and woman according to [[nature]] [''kata phusin'']; for people are by nature [''tēi phusei''] pairing [''sunduastikon''] more than political [''politikon'' = of the ''polis''], in as much as the household [''oikos''] is prior [''proteron'' = earlier] and more necessary than the ''polis'' and making children is more common [''koinoteron''] with the animals. In the other animals, community [''koinōnia''] goes no further than this, but people live together [''sumoikousin''] not only for the sake of making children, but also for the things for life; for from the start the functions [''erga''] are divided, and are different [for] man and woman. Thus they supply each other, putting their own into the common [''eis to koinon'']. It is for these [reasons] that both utility [''chrēsimon''] and pleasure [''hēdu''] seem to be found in this kind of friendship. ([[Nicomachean Ethics]], VIII.12.1162a. Rough literal translation with Greek terms shown in square brackets.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Rousseau]] in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse: with reason, language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems, and that once such cooperation became more important, it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation—often only to defend themselves from each other.

In other words, according to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Theory of Evolution]].

The two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language and politics are a good thing, as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today. Rousseau's theory, that human nature is malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply, for example by [[Karl Marx]], a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.

However, while Rousseau's initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics, including both the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical, in favor of city-states such as [[Geneva]], and [[Arcadia (utopia)|rural living]].

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology of reasoning}}
Scientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]]. Psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances.

Assessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is [[Rationality|rational]] or acts rationally. It is a key research question in the [[psychology of reasoning]]. [[Rationality]] is often divided into its respective [[Rationality#Theoretical and practical rationality|theoretical and practical counterparts]].

====Behavioral experiments on human reasoning====
Experimental cognitive psychologists carry out research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as [[Intelligence tests|intelligence]] or [[IQ]] tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the [[Wason test]]).&lt;ref&gt;Manktelow, K.I. 1999. ''Reasoning and Thinking (Cognitive Psychology: Modular Course.)''. Hove, Sussex:Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g., ''If A then B'' and how they make inferences about alternatives, e.g., ''A or else B''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''. Hillsdale: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations, e.g., ''A is to the left of B'', or ''A happens after B'', and about quantified assertions, e.g., ''All the A are B''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2006). ''How we reason''. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and [[counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developmental studies of children's reasoning====
Developmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood. Piaget's [[theory of cognitive development]] was the first complete theory of reasoning development. Subsequently, several alternative theories were proposed, including the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]].&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K.F.M. van Lieshout (Eds.), Life-span developmental psychology (pp. 179–269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neuroscience of reasoning====
The biological functioning of the brain is studied by [[neurophysiologist]]s and [[neuropsychologist]]s. Research in this area includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains, and of damaged or otherwise unusual brains. In addition to carrying out research into reasoning, some psychologists, for example, [[clinical psychologist]]s and [[psychotherapists]] work to alter people's reasoning habits when they are unhelpful.

===Computer science===

====Automated reasoning====
{{Main|Automated reasoning|Computational logic}}
In [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]], scientists study and use [[automated reasoning]] for diverse applications including [[automated theorem proving]] the [[formal semantics of programming languages]], and [[formal specification]] in [[software engineering]].

====Meta-reasoning====
{{Main|Metacognition}}
'''Meta-reasoning'''&lt;!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--&gt; is reasoning about reasoning.  In computer science, a system performs meta-reasoning when it is reasoning about its own operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Meta-reasoning: A Survey |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2002|volume=2408/2002|issue=65|first=Stefania |last=Costantini |doi=10.1007/3-540-45632-5_11 |pages=253–288|isbn=978-3-540-43960-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requires a programming language capable of [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]], the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour.

===Evolution of reason===
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Capuchin monkeys sharing.jpg|thumb|right|150px| Dan Sperber believes that reasoning in groups is more effective and promotes their evolutionary fitness.]]
A species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about, predict and understand the world. French social and cognitive scientists [[Dan Sperber]] and Hugo Mercier argue that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. They point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs ([[confirmation bias]]). Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective – as demonstrated by the success of projects like [[science]]. They suggest that there are not just individual, but [[group selection]] pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. Their argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than with the search for the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1017/S0140525X10000968 |pmid = 21447233|url = https://repository.upenn.edu/goldstone/15/| volume = 34| issue = 2| pages = 57–74| last1 = Mercier| first1 = Hugo| last2 = Sperber| first2 = Dan| title = Why Do Humans Reason?

[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|250px|thumb|upright|Aristotle, by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
'''Aristotelianism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ɪ|s|t|ə|ˈ|t|iː|l|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} {{respell|ARR|i|stə|TEE|lee|ə|niz|əm}}) is a [[Tradition#Philosophy|tradition]] of [[philosophy]] that takes its defining inspiration from the work of [[Aristotle]]. This school of thought, in the modern sense of philosophy, covers existence, ethics, mind and related subjects. In Aristotle's time, philosophy included [[natural philosophy]], which preceded the advent of [[modern science]] during the [[Scientific Revolution]]. The works of Aristotle were initially defended by the members of the [[Peripatetic school]] and later on by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], who produced many [[Commentaries on Aristotle|commentaries on Aristotle's writings]]. In the [[Islamic Golden Age]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]] translated the works of Aristotle into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and under them, along with philosophers such as [[Al-Kindi]] and [[Al-Farabi]], Aristotelianism became a major part of [[early Islamic philosophy]].

[[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' on it and that became the basis of Jewish scholastic philosophy. Although some of Aristotle's logical works were known to western Europe, it was not until the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]] that the works of Aristotle and his Arabic commentators became widely available. Scholars such as [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] interpreted and systematized Aristotle's works in accordance with [[Catholic theology]].

After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]] was transmitted through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who applied it to history as a totality. Although this project was criticized by [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Trendelenburg]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] as non-Aristotelian, Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. 

Recent Aristotelian ethical and "practical" philosophy, such as that of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[John McDowell|McDowell]], is often premissed upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political [[republicanism]], which views the ''res publica'', public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.

The most famous contemporary Aristotelian philosopher is [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. Especially famous for helping to revive [[virtue ethics]] in his book ''[[After Virtue]]'', MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He juxtaposes Aristotelianism with the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and with rival traditions&amp;nbsp;— including the philosophies of [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]&amp;nbsp;— that reject Aristotle's idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimate capitalism. Therefore, on MacIntyre's account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is "the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one." Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly "revolutionary Aristotelianism". This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell. Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include [[Fred D. Miller, Jr.]] in politics and [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] in ethics.

==History==

===Ancient Greek===
{{Main|Peripatetic school}}
The original followers of Aristotle were the members of the [[Peripatetic school]]. The most prominent members of the school after Aristotle were [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus]], who both continued Aristotle's researches. During the [[Roman era]] the school concentrated on preserving and defending his work.&lt;ref&gt;Furley, David (2003), ''From Aristotle to Augustine: Routledge History of Philosophy'', 2, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The most important figure in this regard was [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] who commentated on Aristotle's writings. With the rise of [[Neoplatonism]] in the 3rd century, Peripateticism as an independent philosophy came to an end, but the Neoplatonists sought to incorporate Aristotle's philosophy within their own system, and produced many [[commentaries on Aristotle]].

===Byzantine Empire&lt;!--'Byzantine Aristotelianism' redirects here--&gt;===
'''Byzantine Aristotelianism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; emerged in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the form of Aristotelian paraphrase: adaptations in which Aristotle's text is rephrased, reorganized, and pruned, in order to make it more easily understood. This genre was allegedly invented by [[Themistius]] in the mid-4th century, revived by [[Michael Psellos]] in the mid-11th century, and further developed by [[Sophonias (commentator)|Sophonias]] in the late 13th to early 14th centuries.&lt;ref name=sep-byz&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=byzantine-philosophy |title=Byzantine Philosophy |last=Ierodiakonou |first=Katerina |last2=Bydén |first2=Börje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo the Mathematician]] was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the [[Magnaura School]] in the mid-9th century to teach Aristotelian logic.&lt;ref name=sep-byz/&gt; The 11th and 12th centuries saw the emergence of twelfth-century Byzantine Aristotelianism. Before the 12th century, the whole Byzantine output of Aristotelian commentaries was focused on logic.&lt;ref name=sep-byz/&gt; However, the range of subjects covered by the Aristotelian commentaries produced in the two decades after 1118 is much greater due to the initiative of the princess [[Anna Comnena]] who commissioned a number of scholars to write commentaries on previously neglected works of Aristotle.&lt;ref name=sep-byz/&gt;

[[Image:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|right|An medieval Arabic representation of [[Aristotle]] teaching a student.]]
In the [[Abbasid Empire]], many foreign works were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], large libraries were constructed, and scholars were welcomed.&lt;ref name="Wiet-Baghdad"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/wiet.html][[Gaston Wiet]]&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;''Baghdad: Metropolis of the Abbasid Caliphate'' Retrieved 2010-04-16&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[caliphs]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] and his son [[Al-Ma'mun]], the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]] flourished. Christian scholar [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] (809–873) was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. In his lifetime, Ishaq translated 116 writings, including works by Plato and Aristotle, into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Arabic.&lt;ref name="Opth"&gt;Opth: Azmi, Khurshid. "Hunain bin Ishaq on Ophthalmic Surgery." Bulletin of the Indian Institute of History of Medicine 26 (1996): 69–74. Web. 29 Oct. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindberg"&gt;Lindberg, David C. The Beginnings of Western Science: Islamic Science. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago]], 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the founding of House of Wisdom, the entire corpus of Aristotelian works that had been preserved (excluding the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'', ''[[Magna Moralia]]'' and ''[[Politics]]'') became available, along with its Greek commentators; this corpus laid a uniform foundation for '''Islamic Aristotelianism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Landfester, Hubert Cancik, Helmuth Schneider (eds.), ''Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. Classical tradition'', Volume 1, Brill, 2006, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Kindi]] (801–873) was the first of the Muslim [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosophers, and is known for his efforts to introduce [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]] to the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein-Frank, F. ''Al-Kindi''. In Leaman, O &amp; Nasr, H (2001). ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Routledge. p 165&lt;/ref&gt; He incorporated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein-Frank (2001) ''Al-Kindi'', pages 166–167. In Oliver Leaman &amp; Hossein Nasr. ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Al-Farabi]] (872–950) had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and in his time was widely thought second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of "the Second Teacher"). His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and [[Sufism]], paved the way for the work of [[Avicenna]] (980–1037).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/| title =Avicenna (Ibn Sina) (c.980–1037)| accessdate =2007-07-13 | publisher =The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna was one of the main interpreters of Aristotle.&lt;ref name="Avicenna Abu Ali Sina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/avicen.html |title=Avicenna (Abu Ali Sina) |publisher=Sjsu.edu |accessdate=2010-01-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111184611/http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/avicen.html |archivedate=11 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school of thought he founded became known as [[Avicennism]], which was built on ingredients and conceptual building blocks that are largely Aristotelian and Neoplatonist.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| authorlink= |title=Avicenna |year=| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica |accessdate=2010-04-14|location=|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the western end of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], during the reign of [[Al-Hakam II]] (961 to 976) in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated into Arabic. [[Averroes]] (1126–1198), who spent much of his life in Cordoba and [[Seville]], was especially distinguished as a commentator of Aristotle. He often wrote two or three different commentaries on the same work, and some 38 commentaries by Averroes on the works of Aristotle have been identified.&lt;ref name="grant30"&gt;Edward Grant, (1996), ''The foundations of modern science in the Middle Ages'', page 30. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Although his writings had only marginal impact in Islamic countries, his works would eventually have a huge impact in the [[Latin West]],&lt;ref name="grant30"/&gt; and would lead to the school of thought known as [[Averroism]].

===Western Europe===
{{also|Scholasticism|Thomism}}
[[File:Aristotle by Raphael.jpg|thumb|Aristotle, holding his Ethics detail from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] fresco [[The School of Athens]]]]
Although some knowledge of Aristotle seems to have lingered on in the ecclesiastical centres of western Europe after the fall of the Roman empire, by the ninth century nearly all that was known of Aristotle consisted of [[Boethius]]'s commentaries on the ''[[Organon]]'', and a few abridgments made by Latin authors of the declining empire, [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Martianus Capella]].&lt;ref name="schmolders"&gt;Auguste Schmolders, ''History of Arabian Philosophy'' in ''The eclectic magazine of foreign literature, science, and art'', Volume 46. February 1859&lt;/ref&gt; From that time until the end of the eleventh century, little progress is apparent in Aristotelian knowledge.&lt;ref name="schmolders"/&gt;

The [[renaissance of the 12th century]] saw a major search by European scholars for new learning. [[James of Venice]], who probably spent some years in [[Constantinople]], translated Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' from Greek into [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] in the mid-twelfth century,&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Reynolds and Nigel G. Wilson, ''Scribes and Scholars,'' Oxford, 1974, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; thus making the complete Aristotelian logical corpus, the ''Organon'', available in Latin for the first time. Scholars travelled to areas of Europe that once had been under Muslim rule and still had substantial Arabic-speaking populations. From central [[Spain]], which had returned to Christian rule in the eleventh century, scholars produced many of the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]]. The most productive of these translators was [[Gerard of Cremona]],&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Haskins, ''Renaissance of the Twelfth Century,'' p. 287. "more of Arabic science passed into Western Europe at the hands of Gerard of Cremona than in any other way."&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 1114–1187), who translated 87 books,&lt;ref&gt;For a list of Gerard of Cremona's translations see: Edward Grant (1974) ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr.), pp. 35–8 or Charles Burnett, "The Coherence of the Arabic-Latin Translation Program in Toledo in the Twelfth Century," ''Science in Context'', 14 (2001): at 249-288, at pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt; which included many of the works of [[Aristotle]] such as his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[On the Heavens]]'', ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''. [[Michael Scot]] (c. 1175–1232) translated  [[Averroes]]' commentaries on the scientific works of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|m/michael_sco|band=5|autor=Christoph Kann|artikel=Michael Scotus|spalten=1459–1461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's physical writings began to be discussed openly, and at a time when Aristotle's method was permeating all theology, these treatises were sufficient to cause his prohibition for [[heterodoxy]] in the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277]].&lt;ref name="schmolders"/&gt; In the first of these, in [[Paris]] in 1210, it was stated that "neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of [[excommunication]]."&lt;ref name="Grant42"&gt;Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', page 42 (1974). Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite further attempts to restrict the teaching of Aristotle, by 1270 the ban on Aristotle's natural philosophy was ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, Richard E. ''Aristotle's Children: How Christians, Muslims, and Jews Rediscovered Ancient Wisdom and Illuminated the Middle Ages'', page 215 (2004). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William of Moerbeke]] (c. 1215–1286) undertook a complete translation of the works of Aristotle or, for some portions, a revision of existing translations. He was the first translator of the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (c. 1260) from Greek into Latin. Many copies of Aristotle in Latin then in circulation were assumed to have been influenced by Averroes, who was suspected of being a source of philosophical and theological errors found in the earlier translations of Aristotle. Such claims were without merit, however, as the ''Alexandrian'' Aristotelianism of Averroes followed "the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, [because] a large amount of traditional [[Neoplatonism]] was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism".&lt;ref name="Schmolders1842"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmölders |first=Auguste |editor1-last=Telford |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Barber |editor2-first=Benjamin Aquila |editor3-last=Watkinson |editor3-first=William Lonsdale |editor4-last=Davison |editor-first4=William Theophilus |title=The London Quarterly Review |volume=11 |year=1859 |publisher=J.A.

In no material point did they differ from their master, and, therefore, an exposition of their doctrines would be useless to those who know anything of the history of philosophy; but, before the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, a large amount of traditional Neo-Platonism was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism, so as to take them sometimes far astray from their master's track.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albertus Magnus]] (c. 1200–1280) was among the first medieval scholars to apply Aristotle's philosophy to Christian thought. He produced paraphrases of most of the works of Aristotle available to him.&lt;ref name="sep-albert"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=albert-great |title=Albert the Great |last=Fhrer |first=Markus}}&lt;/ref&gt; He digested, interpreted and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. His efforts resulted in the formation of a Christian reception of Aristotle in the Western Europe.&lt;ref name="sep-albert"/&gt; Magnus did not repudiate [[Plato]]. In that, he belonged to the dominant tradition of philosophy that preceded him, namely the "concordist tradition",&lt;ref&gt;Henricus Bate, Helmut Boese, Carlos Steel, ''On Platonic Philosophy'', Leuven: Leuven University Press, 1990, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; which sought to harmonize [[Aristotle]] with [[Plato]] through interpretation (see for example [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''On Plato and Aristotle Being Adherents of the Same School''). Magnus famously wrote:

{{quote |''"Scias quod non perficitur homo in philosophia nisi ex scientia duarum philosophiarum: Aristotelis et Platonis."'' (''Metaphysics'', I, tr. 5, c. 5)
(Know that a man is not perfected in philosophy if it weren't for the knowledge of the two philosophers, Aristotle and Plato)}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), the pupil of Albertus Magnus, wrote a dozen commentaries on the works of Aristotle.&lt;ref name="sep-thomas"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=aquinas |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |last=McInerny |first=Ralph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas was emphatically Aristotelian, he adopted Aristotle's analysis of physical objects, his view of place, time and motion, his proof of the prime mover, his cosmology, his account of sense perception and intellectual knowledge, and even parts of his [[Aristotelian ethics|moral philosophy]].&lt;ref name="sep-thomas"/&gt; The philosophical school that arose as a legacy of the work of Thomas Aquinas was known as [[Thomism]], and was especially influential among the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and later, the [[Jesuits]].&lt;ref name="sep-thomas"/&gt;

Using Albert's and Thomas's commentaries, as well as [[Marsilius of Padua|Marsilius of Padua's]] ''[[Defensor pacis]]'', 14th-century scholar [[Nicole Oresme]] translated Aristotle's moral works into French and wrote extensive [[Livre de Politiques|comments]] on them.

===Modern era===
After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]] was transmitted through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who applied it to history as a totality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Although this project was criticized by [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Trendelenburg]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] as un-Aristotelian,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon [[Karl Marx|Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, George E. McCarthy (ed.), ''Marx and Aristotle: Nineteenth-Century German Social Theory and Classical Antiquity'', Although many disagree Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernists]], in contrast, reject Aristotelianism's claim to reveal important theoretical truths.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Ted Sadler, ''Heidegger and Aristotle: The Question of Being'', Athlone, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In this, they follow [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s critique of Aristotle as the greatest source of the entire tradition of Western philosophy.

===Contemporary Aristotelianism===
Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories.&lt;ref&gt;For contrasting examples of this, see Hans-Georg Gadamer, ''[[The Idea of the Good in Platonic-Aristotelian Philosophy]]'' (trans. P. Christopher Smith), Yale University Press, 1986, and Lloyd P. Gerson, ''Aristotle and Other Platonists'', Cornell University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian ethical]] and 'practical' philosophy, such as that of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[John McDowell|McDowell]], is often premised upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political [[republicanism]], which views the ''res publica'', public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The contemporary Aristotelian philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is specially famous for helping to revive [[virtue ethics]] in his book ''[[After Virtue]]''. MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He opposes Aristotelianism to the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and to rival traditions—including the philosophies of [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Nietzsche]]—that reject its idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimize [[capitalism]]. Therefore, on MacIntyre's account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is "the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one."&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, 'An Interview with Giovanna Borradori', in Kelvin Knight (ed.), ''The MacIntyre Reader'', Polity Press / University of Notre Dame Press, 1998, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly 'revolutionary Aristotelianism'. This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'', Polity Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include [[Fred D. Miller, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Fred D. Miller, Jr., ''Nature, Justice, and Rights in Aristotle's Politics'', Oxford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; in politics and [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] in ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Hursthouse, ''On Virtue Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In metaphysics, an Aristotelian realism about [[universals]] is defended by such philosophers as [[David Malet Armstrong]] and [[Stephen Mumford]], and is applied to the philosophy of mathematics by [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]].

==Criticism==

[[Bertrand Russell]] criticizes Aristotle's logic on the following points:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Russell|1967}}, Chapter XXII Aristotle's Logic&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Aristotelian system allows formal defects leading to "bad metaphysics". For example, the following [[syllogism]] is permitted: "All golden mountains are mountains, all golden mountains are golden, therefore some mountains are golden", which insinuates the existence of at least one golden mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Russell|1967|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Russell, a predicate of a predicate can be a predicate of the original subject, which blurs the distinction between names and predicates with disastrous consequences; for example, a class with only one member is erroneously identified with that one member, making it impossible to have a correct theory of the number one.&lt;ref name="Russell 1967 198"&gt;{{harvtxt|Russell|1967|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[syllogism]] is overvalued in comparison to other forms of deduction. For example, syllogisms are not employed in mathematics since they are less convenient.&lt;ref name="Russell 1967 198"/&gt;

In addition, Russell ends his review of the Aristotelian logic with these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I conclude that the Aristotelian doctrines with which we have been concerned in this chapter are wholly false, with the exception of the formal theory of the syllogism, which is unimportant. Any person in the present day who wishes to learn logic will be wasting his time if he reads Aristotle or any of his disciples. Nonetheless, Aristotle's logical writings show great ability, and would have been useful to mankind if they had appeared at a time when intellectual originality was still active. Unfortunately, they appeared at the very end of the creative period of Greek thought, and therefore came to be accepted as authoritative. By the time that logical originality revived, a reign of two thousand years had made Aristotle very difficult to dethrone. Throughout modern times, practically every advance in science, in logic, or in philosophy has had to be made in the teeth of the opposition from Aristotle's disciples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Russell|1967|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Apeiron''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|aɪ|r|ɒ|n}}; {{lang|grc|ἄπειρον}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "(that which is) unlimited," "boundless", "infinite", or "indefinite"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/peiros2|ἄπειρον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|ἀ-}} ''a-'', "without" and {{lang|grc|πεῖραρ}} ''peirar'', "end, limit", "boundary",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pei{{=}}rar|πεῖραρ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ionic Greek]] form of {{lang|grc|πέρας}} ''peras'', "end, limit, boundary".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pe/ras|πέρας|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is akin to [[Persian language|Persian]] ''piramon'', meaning "boundary, circumference, surrounding".

==''Apeiron'' as an origin==
The ''apeiron'' is central to the [[cosmology|cosmological]] theory created by [[Anaximander]], a 6th-century BC [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] whose work is mostly lost.  From the few existing fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or ultimate reality (''[[arche]]'') is eternal and infinite, or boundless (''apeiron''), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5, 204b, 23sq.&lt;DK12,A16.&gt;, Hippolytus, ''Haer.'' I 6, 1 sq. &lt;DK 12 A11, B2.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apeiron'' generated the [[Opposite (semantics)|opposite]]s (hot–cold, wet–dry, etc.) which acted on the creation of the world ([[cf.]] [[Heraclitus]]). Everything is generated from ''apeiron'' and then it is destroyed by going back to ''apeiron'', according to necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''in Phys.'', p. 24, 13sq.&lt;DK 12 A9,B1.&gt;, p. 150, 24sq.&lt;DK 12 A9.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that infinite worlds are generated from ''apeiron'' and then they are destroyed there again.&lt;ref&gt;Aetius I 3,3&lt;Pseudo-Plutarch; DK 12 A14.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas were influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythical]] tradition and by his teacher [[Thales]] (7th to 6th century BC). Searching for some universal principle, Anaximander retained the traditional religious assumption that there was a cosmic order and tried to explain it rationally, using the old mythical language which ascribed divine control on various spheres of reality. This language was more suitable for a society which could see gods everywhere; therefore the first glimmerings of laws of nature were themselves derived from divine laws.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World Publishing Co. Cleveland and New York. pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks believed that the universal principles could also be applied to human societies. The word ''nomos'' (law) may originally have meant ''natural law'' and used later to mean man-made law.&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeferry  (1976) ''The archaic Greece. The Greek city states 700-500 BC''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction. It adopted ''apeiron'' as the origin of all things, because it is completely indefinite. This is a further transition from the previous existing [[mythical]] way of thought to the newer [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main characteristic of the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC). This shift in thought is correlated with the new political conditions in the Greek [[city states]] during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Vernant (1964) ''Les origins de la pensee grecque''. PUF Paris. p. 128; J. P. Vernant (1982) '' The origins of Greek thought''. Ithaca, Cornell University Press. pp. 118, 128. {{ISBN|0-8014-9293-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roots==
In the mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] (8th to 7th century BC) the first [[Greek primordial deities|primordial god]] is [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], which is a void or gap. Chaos is described as a gap either between [[Tartarus]] and the earth's surface (Miller's interpretation) or between earth's surface and the sky (Cornford's interpretation).&lt;ref&gt;''The Theogony of Hesiod''. Transl. H. G. Evelyn White (1914): 116, 736-744 [http://www.sacred-tests.com/cla/hesiod/theogony/htm online]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'First of all': On the Semantics and Ethics of Hesiod's Cosmogony - Mitchell Miller - Ancient Philosophy (Philosophy Documentation Center)|url = https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=ancientphil&amp;id=ancientphil_2001_0021_0002_0251_0276&amp;onlyautologin=true|website = www.pdcnet.org|access-date = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Ritual Basis for Hesiod's Theogony|last = Cornford|first = Francis|publisher = |year = 1950|isbn = |location = |pages = 95–116|work = The Unwritten Philosophy and other Essays}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can name it also [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]] (having no bottom).

Alternately, Greek [[philosopher]] [[Thales]] believed that the origin or first principle was water. [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (6th century BC) probably called the water also ''Chaos'' and this is not placed at the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC |page=57| isbn =978-0-521-27455-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation stories of Near East the primordial world is described formless and empty. The only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. The Babylonian cosmology [[Enuma Elish]] describes the earliest stage of the universe as one of watery chaos and something similar is described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC|isbn=9780521294201}} p 58,59 {{ISBN|0-521-29420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Hindu]] cosmogony which is similar to the [[Vedic]] ([[Hiranyagarbha]]) the initial state of the universe was an absolute darkness.

Hesiod made an abstraction, because his original ''chaos'' is a void, something completely indefinite. In his opinion the origin should be indefinite and indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gigon (1968) ''Der Umsprung der Griechishe Philosophie. Von Hesiod bis Parmenides''. Bale. Stuttgart, Schwabe &amp; Co. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in [[Homer]] (indefinite sea). A fragment from [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BC)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK 21 B 28&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; shows the transition from ''chaos'' to ''apeiron'': "The upper limit of earth borders on air. The lower limit reaches down to the unlimited. (i.e. the Apeiron)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The world of Parmenides|author=Karl.R.Popper|year=1998|publisher=Rootledge.New York|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=V76PlyggwQkC|isbn=9780415173018}} p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Either ''apeiron'' meant the "spatial indefinite" and was implied to be indefinite in kind, or Anaximander intended it primarily 'that which is indefinite in kind' but assumed it also to be of unlimited extent and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield |year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC |pages=10, 110 |isbn=978-0-521-27455-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas may have been influenced by the [[Pythagoreans]]:{{Quote|[...] for they [the Pythagoreans] plainly say that when the one had been constructed, whether out of planes or of surface or of seed or of elements which they cannot express, immediately the nearest part of the unlimited began to be drawn in and limited by the limit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philolaus]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Greek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction making ''apeiron'' the principle of all things and some scholars saw a gap  between the existing ''mythical'' and the new ''rational'' way of thought (''rationalism''). But if we follow the course, we will see that there is not such an abrupt break with the previous thought. The basic elements of nature, [[water (classical element)|water]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], which the first Greek philosophers believed that composed the world, represent in fact the mythical primordial forces. The collision of these forces produced the cosmic harmony according to the Greek cosmogony (Hesiod).&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Mossé]] (1984) ''La Grece archaique d'Homere a Eschyle.'' Edition du Seuil. p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between these elements, therefore he chose something else (indefinite in kind) which could generate the others without experiencing any decay.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5, 204b 23sq.&lt;DK 12 A 16.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a fragment attributed to his teacher Thales:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius,&lt;DK 11 A1.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0004.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.1&lt;/ref&gt; "What is divine? What has no origin, nor end." This probably led his student to his final decision for ''apeiron'', because the divinity applied to it implies that it always existed. The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This ''arche'' is called "eternal and ageless" (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83 |isbn=978-0-521-29420-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the world==
The ''apeiron'' has generally been understood as a sort of [[Substance theory|primal chaos]]. It acts as the substratum supporting opposites such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Parmenides: Eleatic Monism and Later Presocratic Thought |author= Patricia Curd |year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=77|isbn=978-0-691-01182-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2JX1ulXzogC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Out of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass—this earth of ours—cylindrical in shape. A sphere of fire surrounded the air around the earth and had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree. When it broke, it created the sun, the moon and the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Strom.'' 2, fr.179 Sandbach &lt;DK 12 A 10.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first animals were generated in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Aetius V 19,4 &lt;DK 12 A 30.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When they came to earth they were transmuted by the effect of the sun. The human being sprung from some other animal, which originally was similar to a fish.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''Haer.'' I 6,6 &lt;DK 12 A 11.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world clustering around the earth, which to the ancient thinker is the central figure.

==Interpretations==
In the commentary of [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] on Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' the following fragment is attributed direct to Anaximander:
{{Quote|Whence things have their origin, there their destruction happens as it is ordained [Greek: ''kata to chreon'' means "according to the debt"]. For they give ''justice'' and ''compensation'' to one another for their ''injustice'' according to the ordering of time.}}
This fragment remains a mystery because it can be translated in different ways. Simplicius comments that Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between the four elements (earth, air, water, fire), therefore he did not choose one of them as an origin, but something else which generates the opposites without experiencing any decay. He mentions also that Anaximander said all these in poetic terms,&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius in Phys. p. 24, 13sq.&lt;DK12a9,B1&gt;
{{Quote|Anaximander from Miletus, son of Praxiades student and descendant of Thales, said that the origin and the element of things (beings) is apeiron and he is the first who used this name for the origin (arche). He says that the origin is neither water, nor any other of the so-called elements, but something of different nature, unlimited. From it are generated the skies and the worlds which exist between them. Whence things (beings) have their origin, there their destruction happens as it is ordained. For they give justice and compensation to one another for their injustice according to the ordering of time, as he said in poetic terms. Obviously noticing the mutual changes between the four elements, he didn't demand to make one of them a subject, but something else except these. He considers that genesis takes place without any decay of this element, but with the generation of the opposites by his own movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that he used the old mythical language. The Goddess ''Justice'' ([[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]), appears to keep the order.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. Cleveland and New York. p. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; The quotation is close to the original meanings of the relevant Greek words. The word ''dike'' (justice) was probably originally derived from the boundaries of a man's land and transmits metaphorically the notion that somebody must remain in his own sphere, respecting the one of his neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[adikia]]'' (injustice) means that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, something that could disturb "law and order" (''[[Eunomia (goddess)|eunomia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeffery (1976) ''The archaic Greece. The Greek city states 700–500 BC''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' ''eunomia'' is contrasted with ''[[hubris]]'' (arrogance).&lt;ref&gt;''Homer: Odyssey.'' 17.487&lt;/ref&gt; Arrogance was considered very dangerous because it could break the balance and lead to political instability and finally to the destruction of a ''city-state''.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] (1st century BC) transmits a different quotation:
{{Quote|Everything is generated from ''apeiron'' and there its destruction happens. Infinite worlds are generated and they are destructed there again. And he says (Anaximander) why this is ''apeiron''. Because only then genesis and decay will never stop.|Aetius I 3,3&lt;Ps.Plutarch; DK 12 A14.&gt;}}
Therefore, it seems that Anaximander argued about ''apeiron'' and this is also noticed by [[Aristotle]]:
{{Quote|The belief that there is something ''apeiron'' stems from the idea that only then genesis and decay will never stop, when that from which is taken what is generated is ''apeiron''.|Aristotle, ''Physics'' 203b 18–20 &lt;DK 12 A 15.&gt;}}
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche (1962) ''Philosophy in the tragic age of the Greeks.''. Washington DC: Regnery, Gateway.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist and that he viewed all coming to be as an illegitimate emancipation from the eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. In accordance to this the world of the individual definite objects should perish into the indefinite since anything definite has to eventually return to the indefinite. His ideas had a great influence on many scholars including [[Martin Heidegger]].

[[Werner Heisenberg]], noted for the creation of [[quantum mechanics]], arrived at the idea that the elementary particles are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same "primordial substance". Because of its similarity to the primordial substance hypothesized by Anaximander, his colleague [[Max Born]] called this substance ''apeiron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bmcpsgp-Ml4C&amp;pg=PA546|title= A Cultural History of Physics|last=Simonyi|first=Károly|author-link=Károly Simonyi|date=April 7, 2012|website=Chapter 5.5.10 Back to the Apeiron?|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012|via=[[Google Books]]|isbn= 9781568813295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in other fields, e.g. [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell (1946) ''History of Western Philosophy'' NY. Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Bowra]],&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and N. York. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; didn't deny that Anaximander was the first who used the term ''apeiron'', but claimed that the mysterious fragment is dealing with the balance of opposite forces as central to reality being closer to the quotation transmitted by Simplicius.

There are also other interpretations which try to match both the previous aspects. ''Apeiron'' is an abstract, void, something that cannot be described according to the Greek pessimistic belief for death. Death indeed meant "nothingless". The dead live like shadows and there is no return to the real world. Everything generated from ''apeiron'' must return there according to the principle genesis-decay. There is a polar attraction between the opposites genesis-decay, arrogance-justice. The existence itself carries a guilt.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gigon (1968) ''Der Umsprung der Griechische Philosophie. Von Hesiod bis Parmenides''. Bale Stutgart, Schwabe &amp; Co. pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The idea that the fact of existence by itself carries along an incurable guilt is Greek (''Theognis'' 327) and anybody claims that surpasses it, commits arrogance and therefore he becomes guilty. The first half of the 6th century is a period of great social instability in Miletus, the city state where Anaximander lives. Any attempt of excess leads to exaggerations and each exaggeration must be corrected. All these have to be paid according to the debt. The things give justice to one another with the process of time.}}
Justice has to destroy everything which is born. There is no external limit that can restrict the activities of men, except the destruction. Arrogance is an expression of the chaotic element of human existence and in a way a part of the rebounding mechanism of order, because pushing it to exertions causes destruction which is also a reestablishment.&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (2004) ''Ce qui fait la Grece 1. D'Homere a Heracklite. Seminaires 1982-1983. La creation humain II''. Edition du Seuil. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Greek and Western thought==
We may assume that the contradiction in the different interpretations is because Anaximander combined two different ways of thought. The first one dealing with ''apeiron'' is metaphysical (and can lead to [[monism]]), while the second one dealing with mutual changes and the balance of the opposites as central to reality is physical.&lt;ref&gt;M. O. Sullivan (1985) ''The four seasons of Greek philosophy''. Efstathiadis group. Athens. pp. 28–31 (Edition in English)&lt;/ref&gt; The same [[paradox]] existed in the Greek way of thought. The Greeks believed that each individual had unlimitable potentialities both in brain and in heart, an outlook which called a man to live at the top of his powers. But that there was a limit to his most violent ambitions, that arrogance-injustice (''hubris'' or ''adikia'') could disturb the harmony and balance. In that case justice (''[[Dike (mythology)|dike]]'') would destroy him to reestablish the order.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) The Greek experience. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. pp. 63, 89&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are obvious in later Greek philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (2004) ''Ce qui fait la grece 1. D'Homere a Heraclite. Seminaires 1982–1983. La creation Humain II''. Editions du Seuil. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philolaus]] (5th century BC) mentions that nature constituted and is organized with the world from unlimitable ({{lang-grc|ἄπειρα}} ''apeira'', plural of ''apeiron'') and limitable. Everything which exists in the world contains the unlimited (''apeiron'') and the limited.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK B1.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Something similar is mentioned by [[Plato]]: Nothing can exist if it doesn't contain continually and simultaneously the limited and the unlimited, the definite and the indefinite.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Philebus]] 16c.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doctrines existing in Western thought, still transmit some of the original ideas: "God ordained that all men shall die", "Death is a common debt". The Greek word ''adikia'' (injustice) transmits the notion that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, without respecting the one of his neighbour. Therefore, he commits [[hubris]]. The relative English word ''arrogance'' (claim as one's own without justification; {{lang-la|arrogare}}), is very close to the original meaning of the aphorism: "Nothing in excess."

==Other pre-Socratic philosophers' ideas about ''apeiron''==
Other [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers had different theories of the ''apeiron''. For the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular, [[Philolaus]]), the universe had begun as an ''apeiron'', but at some point it inhaled the void from outside, filling the cosmos with vacuous bubbles that split the world into many different parts.  For [[Anaxagoras]], the initial ''apeiron'' had begun to rotate rapidly under the control of a godlike ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind), and the great speed of the rotation caused the universe to break up into many fragments. However, since all individual things had originated from the same ''apeiron'', all things must contain parts of all other things—for instance, a tree must also contain tiny pieces of sharks, moons, and grains of sand. This alone explains how one object can be transformed into another, since each thing already contains all other things in germ.

      <text bytes="4138" xml:space="preserve">'''Arationality''' is the state or characteristic of being arational, of being outside the [[Domain_of_discourse|domain]] of [[reason]]. The term is distinct from [[irrationality]], which describes a state that goes ''against'' reason rather than beyond it. In this regard, that of going beyond reason, arationality is also contrary to [[positivism]], the belief that reality can be understood rationally.&lt;ref name="Helminiak"&gt;Daniel A. Helminiak.
Religion and the Human Sciences: An Approach via Spirituality. SUNY Press, [https://books.google.gr/books?id=mDEJxKShHIcC&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=arationality&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=arationality&amp;f=false p.75-80].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arationality is also identified with certain pre-modern modes of thinking, including magic and ritual.&lt;ref name="Helminiak"/&gt;

== Arationality and novelty ==

The concept of arationality can be viewed in relation to the question of [[novelty]].&lt;ref&gt; of how new things come into being.
{{cite journal
 |last=Hausman |first=Carl R.
 |date=1964
 |title= Spontaneity Its Arationality and Its Reality

 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=20–47
 |doi=10.5840/ipq19644138
 |ref=harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new song for instance can always be reduced to the musical notes that compose it, all of which preexisted the song's creation. But despite being composed of "old" things (musical notes), one could still ask: to what extend did something new come into existence when the song was first composed. A real theory of novelty then, i.e. a theory that can account for "newness", should be able to show how things come into being without first reducing them to things that already are. To avoid this [[reductionism|reductionist]] trap we might need to go beyond the very methods that work by way of reduction, i.e. [[Scientific_method|scientific reason]] and [[Logic|formal logic]]. A true theory of novelty therefore might need to acknowledge in the creative process, whether artistic or physical, an arational source.

As an example we could think of the event we call the [[Big Bang]]. [[Cosmology|Cosmologists]] affirm that our universe started with an explosion that brought into existence, not only the matter and energy that constitutes it, but also the very fabric of time and space.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |bibcode=1931Natur.128..704L
 |doi=10.1038/128704a0
 |ref=harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the event itself must have happened outside of time and space, in a "non-place" and "non-time". Considering that our logic works exclusively within the categories of time and space, something that happened before these categories even existed is necessarily beyond logic, or in other words, arational.

An '''internal monologue''', also called '''self-talk''', '''inner speech''', '''inner discourse''' or '''internal discourse''', is a person's inner voice which provides a running verbal [[monologue]] of thoughts while they are [[conscious]].&lt;ref name=PT2&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-talk&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually tied to a person's [[sense of self]]. It is particularly important in planning, problem solving, [[introspection|self-reflection]], [[self-image]], [[critical thinking]], [[emotion]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = AT | year = 2008 | title = The Evolution of the [[Cognitive Model]] of Depression and Its Neurobiological Correlates | url = | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 165 | issue = 8| pages = 969–977 | pmid = 18628348 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08050721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[subvocalization]] (reading in one's head). As a result, it is relevant to a number of [[mental disorder]]s, such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and treatments like [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] which seek to alleviate symptoms by providing strategies to regulate cognitive behaviour. It may reflect both conscious and subconscious beliefs.&lt;ref name=PT2/&gt;

In some cases people may think of inner speech as coming from an external source, as with [[schizophrenic]] [[auditory hallucinations]]. Additionally, not everyone has a verbal internal monologue (see {{slink||Absence of an internal monologue}}). The looser flow of thoughts and experiences, verbal or not, is called a [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], which can also refer to a [[Stream of consciousness|related technique]] in literature.

In a theory of [[child development]] formulated by [[Lev Vygotsky]], inner speech has a precursor in [[private speech]] (talking to oneself) at a young age.&lt;ref name="ShafferKipp2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David David Reed Shaffer|author2=Katherine Kipp|title=Developmental Psychology: Childhood &amp; Adolescence: Childhood and Adolescence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CuvXxrhk8HUC&amp;pg=PA290|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60171-5|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
An '''inner discourse''', or '''internal discourse''', is a constructive act of the human [[mind]] and a tool for discovering new knowledge and making decisions. Along with [[feeling]]s such as joy, anger, fear, etc., and sensory [[awareness]], it is one of the few aspects of the processing of information and other mental activities of which humans can be directly aware. Inner discourse is so prominent in the human awareness of mental functioning that it may often seem to be synonymous with "mind". The view is then that "mind" means "what one experiences when thinking things out", and that "thinking things out" is believed to consist only of the words heard in internal discourse. This common sense idea of the mind must either block out the fact that the mind is constantly processing all kinds of information below the level of awareness, or else rename that activity to some putatively "non-mental" status such as "reflex reaction" or even, sometimes, "demon possession".

An inner discourse takes place much as would a discussion with a second person. One might think, "I need $27 for the paper boy. I have some cash in my wallet. Ten plus ten plus five... I have $25. Maybe I dropped coins in the sofa. Ah, here they are..." The ideal form of inner discourse would seem to be one that starts with statements about matters of fact and proceeds with logical rigor until a solution is achieved.

On this view of thinking, progress toward better thinking is made when one learns how to evaluate how well "statements of fact" are actually grounded, and when one learns how to avoid logical errors. But one must also take account of questions like why one is seeking a solution (Why do I want to contribute money to this charity?), and why one may keep getting results that turn out to be biased in fairly consistent patterns (Why do I never give to charities that benefit a certain group?).

[[Cognitive therapy]] aims to improve functioning by helping people identify and change negative self-talk. It involves identifying the beliefs that colour our perception of the world.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hope-relationships/201605/the-power-positive-self-talk&lt;/ref&gt;  Reminding yourself to never say anything to yourself that you would not say to a friend is a good strategy to develop positive self-talk.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/positive-thinking/art-20043950?pg=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenging unhelpful or negative thoughts can include questions that:
# act as a reality check
# seek alternative explanations
# put things into perspective
# are goal-directed&lt;ref&gt;https://au.reachout.com/articles/how-to-challenge-negative-thoughts&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative self-talk===
Negative self-talk (also known as unhelpful self-talk) refers to [[inner critic]]al dialogue. It is based on beliefs about ourselves that develop during childhood based on feedback of others, particularly parents.&lt;ref name="Beck, A.T. 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D.A., &amp; Beck, A.T. (1999). Scientific foundations of cognitive theory and therapy of depression. New York, NY: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-18970-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A.T. (1972). Depression: Causes and treatment. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-7652-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These beliefs create a lens through which the present is viewed.  Examples of these core beliefs that lead to negative self-talk are: "I am worthless", "I am a failure", "I am unlovable".&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

===Positive self-talk===
Positive self-talk (also known as helpful self-talk) involves noticing the reality of the situation, overriding beliefs and biases that can lead to negative self-talk.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

Coping self-talk is a particular form of positive self-talk that helps improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;Stallman, H. M. (2017). Care · Collaborate · Connect: Suicide Prevention Training Program.

==Relation to the self==
Inner speech is strongly associated with a [[sense of self]], and the development of this sense in children is tied to the development of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cameron |first1=Claire |title=What Happens When You Can't Talk to Yourself? |url=http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/what-happens-when-you-cant-talk-to-yourself |accessdate=21 December 2018 |work=[[Nautilus (science magazine)|Nautilus]] |date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, examples of an internal monologue or inner voice being considered external to the [[self]], such as [[auditory hallucination]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moseley |first1=Peter |title=Talking to ourselves: the science of the little voice in your head |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/aug/21/science-little-voice-head-hearing-voices-inner-speech |accessdate=21 December 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the conceptualisation of negative or critical thoughts as an [[inner critic]], and as a kind of [[Interior locution|divine intervention]].&lt;ref name="Dinkler2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michal Beth Dinkler|title=Silent Statements: Narrative Representations of Speech and Silence in the Gospel of Luke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9rmBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|date=14 October 2013|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-033114-1|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallett2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicky Hallett|title=The Senses in Religious Communities, 1600–1800: Early Modern 'Convents of Pleasure'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hd-qCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-01633-5|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[delusion]], this can be called "[[thought insertion]]".&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = J.R. | year = 2013 | title = Out of Nowhere: Thought Insertion, Ownership and Context-Integration | url = | journal = Conscious and Cognition | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 111–122 | doi=10.1016/j.concog.2012.11.012| pmid = 23262256 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.676.1811 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not necessarily external, a [[conscience]] is also often thought of as an "inner voice".

=== Absence of an internal monologue ===
According to one study, there is wide variation in how often people report experiencing internal monologue, and some people report very little or none.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pristine-inner-experience/201110/not-everyone-conducts-inner-speech&lt;/ref&gt; Younger children are less likely to report using inner speech instead of visual thinking than older children and adults, though it is not known whether this is due to lack of inner speech, or due to insufficiently developed [[introspection]].&lt;!--

|quote=The child was asked questions like, ‘Is she just thinking, up in her head, or is she also saying things to herself, up in her head?’ The 6-and 7-year-olds acknowledged that inner speech was probably going on, but the 4-year-olds were much less likely to do so. In a second experiment, children were given a task designed specifically to elicit inner speech, such as thinking silently about how their own name sounded. Forty per cent of 4-year-olds and 55 per cent of 5-year-olds admitted to having used inner speech rather than a visual method for getting the answer, figures that were significantly lower than the equivalent scores for adults.

===Role in trauma - the "inner critic"===
The ways in which the inner voice acts have been correlated with certain mental conditions such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tartakovsky |first1=Margarita |title=Home » Blog » What to Do with a Cruel Inner Critic What to Do with a Cruel Inner Critic |url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/what-to-do-with-a-cruel-inner-critic/ |website=[[Psych Central]] |accessdate=28 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of internal monologue may be inherently critical of the person, and even go so far as to feature direct insults or challenges to the individual's behaviour. According to Dr. Lisa Firestone, this "inner critic"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Critical Inner Voice Explained |url=https://www.psychalive.org/critical-inner-voice/ |website=PsychAlive}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "based on implicit memories of trauma experienced in childhood", and may be the result of both significant traumas (that result in PTSD or other stress disorders) or minor ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inner Voices: A Common Symptom of PTSD |url=https://helpfortrauma.com/uncategorized/inner-voices-a-common-symptom-of-ptsd/ |website=Help For Trauma |accessdate=28 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
One study found that inner speech use was reported most frequently for self-regulation (e.g. planning and problem solving), self‐reflection (e.g. emotions, self‐motivation, appearance, behavior/performance, and autobiography), and critical thinking (e.g., evaluating, judging, and criticizing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morin |first1=Alain |last2=Duhnych |first2=Christina |last3=Racy |first3=Famira |title=Self-reported inner speech use in university students |journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |date=May 2018 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=376–382 |doi=10.1002/acp.3404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
In the 1920s, Swiss developmental psychologist [[Jean Piaget]] proposed the idea that [[Private speech|private (or "egocentric") speech]]—speaking to yourself out loud—is the initial form of speech, from which "social speech" develops, and that it dies out as children grow up.&lt;ref name="Cohn1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorrit Cohn|title=Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmIQoPdb1SgC&amp;pg=PA95|year=1978|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-10156-9|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] proposed instead that private speech develops ''from'' social speech, and later becomes internalised as an internal monologue, rather than dying out.&lt;ref name="Punter2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Punter|title=Writing the Passions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r1GPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT183|date=19 September 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-88447-7|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation has come to be the more widely accepted, and is supported by empirical research.&lt;ref name="ShafferKipp2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Simon R. |last2=Fernyhough |first2=Charles |title=Thought as action: Inner speech, self-monitoring, and auditory verbal hallucinations |journal=Consciousness and Cognition |date=June 2007 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=391–9 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2005.12.003 |pmid=16464616 |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/c.p.fernyhough/papers/J&amp;FC&amp;C.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implicit in the idea of a social origin to inner speech is the possibility of "inner ''dialogue''" – a form of "internal collaboration with oneself."&lt;ref name="LloydFernyhough1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Lloyd|author2=Charles Fernyhough|title=Lev Vygotsky: Critical Assessments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZkuae-jB3QC&amp;pg=PA375|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-11152-2|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria C.M. de Guerrero|title=Inner Speech - L2: Thinking Words in a Second Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uz2Y3xl71CIC&amp;pg=PA37|date=30 March 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-24578-2|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vygotsky believed inner speech takes on its own syntactic peculiarities, with heavy use of abbreviation and omission compared with oral speech (even more so compared with written speech).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vygotsky |first1=L. S. |title=Thinking and Speech |date=1934 |page=203 |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/words/Thinking-and-Speech.pdf |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andy Clark]] (1998) writes that social language is "especially apt to be co-opted for more private purposes of [...] self-inspection and self-criticism," although others have defended the same conclusions on different grounds.&lt;ref name="Langland-HassanVicente2018"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Langland-Hassan|author2=Agustin Vicente|title=Inner Speech: New Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzdtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|date=18 October 2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-879664-0|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological correlates==
{{reimprove|section|date=December 2017}}
The concept of internal monologue is not new, but the emergence of the functional MRI has led to a better understanding of the mechanisms of internal speech by allowing researchers to see localized brain activity.

Studies have revealed the differences in neural activations of inner dialogues versus those of monologues. Functional [[MRI]] imaging studies have shown that monologic internal speech involves the activation of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] and the left [[inferior frontal gyrus]], which is the standard language system that is activated during any kind of speech. However, dialogical inner speech implicates several additional neural regions. Studies have indicated overlap with regions involved with thinking about other minds.

In regard to research on inner speech Fernyhough stated, "The new science of inner speech tells us that it is anything but a solitary process. Much of the power of self-talk comes from the way it orchestrates a dialogue between different points of view." Based on interpretation of functional medical-imaging, Fernyhough believes that language system of internal dialogue works in conjunction with a part of the [[social cognition]] system (localized in the [[right hemisphere]] close to the intersection between the [[temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[parietal lobes]]). Neural imaging seems to support Vygotsky's theory that when individuals are talking to themselves, they are having an actual conversation. Intriguingly, individuals did not exhibit this same arrangement of neural activation with silent monologues. In past studies, it has been supported that these two brain hemispheres to have different functions. Based on [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] studies, inner speech has been shown to more significant activations farther back in the temporal lobe, in [[Heschl's gyrus]].

However, the results of neural imaging have to be taken with caution because the regions of the brain activated during spontaneous, natural internal speech diverge from those that are activated on demand. In research studies, individuals are asked to talk to themselves on demand, which is different than the natural development of inner speech within one's mind. The concept of internal monologue is an elusive study and is subjective to many implications with future studies.

==In literature==
In literary criticism there is a similar term, [[interior monologue]]. This, sometimes, is used as a synonym for stream of consciousness: a [[narrative mode]] or method that attempts to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. (Harmondsworth, Penguin Books,1984), pp. 660-1).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'' suggests, that "they can also be distinguished psychologically and literarily. In a psychological sense, stream of consciousness is the subject‐matter, while interior monologue is the technique for presenting it". And for literature, "while an interior monologue always presents a character's thoughts 'directly', without the apparent intervention of a summarizing and selecting narrator, it does not necessarily mingle them with impressions and perceptions, nor does it necessarily violate the norms of grammar, or logic—but the stream of consciousness technique also does one or both of these things".&lt;ref&gt;ed. Chris Baldick, Oxford: Oxford U.P.,  2009, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dialogical logic''' (also known as the '''logic of dialogues''') was conceived as a pragmatic approach to the [[semantics of logic]] that resorts to concepts of [[game theory]] such as "winning a play" and that of "winning strategy".

Since dialogical logic was the first approach to the semantics of logic using notions stemming from game theory, game theoretical semantics (GTS) and dialogical logic are often conflated under the term ''[[game semantics]]''. However, as discussed below, though GTS and dialogical logic are both rooted in a game-theoretical perspective, in fact, they have quite different philosophical and logical background.

Nowadays it has been extended to a general framework for the study of meaning, knowledge, and inference constituted during interaction. The new developments include cooperative dialogues and dialogues deploying a fully interpreted language (''dialogues with content'').

== Origins and further developments ==
The philosopher and mathematician [[Paul Lorenzen]] ([[University of Erlangen–Nuremberg|Erlangen-Nürnberg-Universität]]) was the first to introduce a semantics of games for logic in the late 1950s. Lorenzen called this semantics 'dialogische Logik', or dialogic logic. Later, it was developed extensively by his pupil [[Kuno Lorenz]] (Erlangen-Nürnberg Universität, then Saarland). [[Jaakko Hintikka]] ([[Helsinki]], [[Boston]]) developed a little later to Lorenzen a model-theoretical approach known as GTS.

Since then, a significant number of different game semantics have been studied in logic. Since 1993, {{ill|Shahid Rahman|fr}} and his collaborators have developed dialogical logic within a general framework aimed at the study of the logical and philosophical issues related to [[logical pluralism]]. More precisely, by 1995 a kind of revival of dialogical logic was generated that opened new and unexpected possibilities for logical and philosophical research. The philosophical development of dialogical logic continued especially in the fields of [[argumentation theory]], legal reasoning, [[computer science]], [[applied linguistics]], and [[artificial intelligence]].

The new results in dialogical logic began on one side, with the works of [[Jean-Yves Girard]] in [[linear logic]] and interaction; on the other, with the study of the interface of logic, mathematical [[game theory]] and argumentation, [[argumentation framework]]s and [[defeasible reasoning]], by researchers such as [[Samson Abramsky]], [[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]], [[Andreas Blass]], Nicolas Clerbout, [[Frans H. van Eemeren]], Mathieu Fontaine, [[Dov Gabbay]], [[Rob Grootendorst]], [[Giorgi Japaridze]], Laurent Keiff, Erik Krabbe, Alain Leconte, Rodrigo Lopez-Orellana, Sébasten Magnier, Mathieu Marion, Zoe McConaughey, Henry Prakken, Juan Redmond, Helge Rückert, Gabriel Sandu, Giovanni Sartor, [[Douglas N. Walton]], and [[John Woods (logician)|John Woods]] among others, who have contributed to place dialogical interaction and games at the center of a new perspective of logic, where logic is defined as an instrument of dynamic inference.

Four research programs address the interface of meaning, knowledge, and logic in the context of dialogues, games, or more generally interaction:

# The constructivist approach of Paul Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz, who sought to overcome the limitations of operative logic by providing dialogical foundations to it. The [[Method of analytic tableaux|method of semantic tableaux]] for classical and [[intuitionistic logic]] as introduced by [[Evert W. Beth]] (1955){{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} could thus be identified as a method for the notation of winning strategies of particular dialogue games (Lorenzen/Lorenz 1978, Lorenz 1981, Felscher 1986).{{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} This, as mentioned above has been extended by Shahid Rahman and collaborators to a general framework for the study of classical and non-classical logics. Rahman and his team of Lille, in order to develop dialogues with content, enriched the dialogical framework with fully interpreted languages (as implemented within [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s [[constructive type theory]]).
# The game-theoretical approach of [[Jaakko Hintikka]], called GTS. This approach shares the game-theoretical tenets of dialogical logic for [[logical constant]]s; but turns to standard [[model theory]] when the analysis process reaches the level of elementary statements. At this level standard truth-functional formal semantics comes into play. Whereas in the ''formal plays'' of dialogical logic P will loose both plays on an elementary proposition, namely the play where the thesis states this proposition and the play where he states its negation; in GTS one of both will be won by the defender. A subsequent development was launched by [[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]] (and his group in Amsterdam) in his book ''Logic in Games'', which combines the game-theoretical approaches with [[Epistemic modal logic|epistemic logic]].
# The [[argumentation theory]] approach of [[Else M. Barth]] and Erik Krabbe (1982),{{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} who sought to link dialogical logic with the informal logic or critical reasoning originated by the seminal work of [[Chaim Perelman]] (Perelman/Olbrechts-Tyteca 1958),{{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} [[Stephen Toulmin]] (1958),{{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} [[Arne Næss]] (1966){{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} and [[Charles Leonard Hamblin]] (1970){{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} and developed further by Ralph Johnson (1999),{{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} Douglas N. Walton (1984),{{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} John Woods (1988){{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} and associates. Further developments include the [[argumentation framework]] of P.D. Dung and others, the [[defeasible reasoning]] approach of Henry Prakken and Giovanni Sartor, and [[pragma-dialectics]] by Frans H. van Eemeren and Rob Grootendorst.
# The [[ludics]] approach, initiated by Jean-Yves Girard, which provides an overall theory of [[proof theory|proof-theoretical]] meaning based on interactive computation.

According to the dialogical perspective, knowledge, meaning, and truth are conceived as a result of social interaction, where normativity is not understood as a type of pragmatic operator acting on a propositional nucleus destined to express knowledge and meaning, but on the contrary: the type of normativity that emerges from the social interaction associated with knowledge and meaning is constitutive of these notions. In other words, according to the conception of the dialogical framework, the intertwining of the right to ask for reasons, on the one hand, and the obligation to give them, on the other, provides the roots of knowledge, meaning and truth.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This formulation can be seen as linking the perspective of [[Robert Brandom]] with that of the logic of dialogue. See Mathieu Marion (2009).{{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} For a discussion about what they have in common and what distinguishes both approaches, see {{harvtxt|Rahman|McConaughey|Klev|Clerbout|2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local and global meaning ==
As hinted by its name, this framework studies dialogues, but it also takes the form of dialogues. In a dialogue, two parties (players) argue on a thesis (a certain statement that is the subject of the whole argument) and follow certain fixed rules in their argument. The player who states the thesis is the Proponent, called '''P''', and his rival, the player who challenges the thesis, is the Opponent, called '''O'''. In challenging the Proponent's thesis, the Opponent is requiring of the Proponent that he defends his statement.

The interaction between the two players '''P''' and '''O''' is spelled out by challenges and defences, implementing [[Robert Brandom]]'s take on meaning as a game of giving and asking for reasons. Actions in a dialogue are called moves; they are often understood as speech-acts involving declarative utterances (''assertions'') and interrogative utterances (''requests''). The rules for dialogues thus never deal with expressions isolated from the act of uttering them.

The rules in the dialogical framework are divided into two kinds of rules'': particle rules'' and ''structural rules''. Whereas the first determine ''local meaning'', the second determine ''global meaning''.

Local meaning explains the meaning of an expression, independently of the rules setting the development of a dialogue. Global meaning sets the meaning of an expression in the context of some specific form of developing a dialogue.

More precisely:

* Particle rules (''Partikelregeln''), or rules for logical constants, determine the legal moves in a play and regulate interaction by establishing the relevant moves constituting ''challenges'': moves that are an appropriate attack to a previous move (a statement) and thus require that the challenged player play the appropriate defence to the attack. If the challenged player defends his statement, he has answered the challenge.
* Structural rules (''Rahmenregeln'') on the other hand determine the general course of a dialogue game, such as how a game is initiated, how to play it, how it ends, and so on. The point of these rules is not so much to spell out the meaning of the logical constants by specifying how to act in an appropriate way (this is the role of the particle rules); it is rather to specify according to what structure interactions will take place. It is one thing to determine the meaning of the logical constants as a set of appropriate challenges and defences, it is another to define whose turn it is to play and when a player is allowed to play a move.

In the most basic case, the particle rules set the local meaning of the logical constants of first-order classical and intuitionistic logic. More precisely the local meaning is set by the following distribution of choices:

* If the defender '''X''' states "A or B", the challenger '''Y''' has the right to ask him to choose between A and B.
* If the defender '''X''' states "A and B", the challenger '''Y''' has the right to choose between asking the defender to state A or to state B.
* If the defender '''X''' states that "if A then B", the challenger '''Y''' has the right to ask for B by granting herself (the challenger) A.
* If the defender '''X''' states "no-A", then the challenger '''Y''' has the right to state A (and then she has the obligation to defend this assertion).
* If the defender '''X''' states for "all the x's it is the case that A[x]", the challenger '''Y''' has the right to choose a singular term t and ask the defender to substitute this term for the free variables in A[x].
* If the defender '''X''' states "there is at least one x, for which it is the case that A[x]", the challenger '''Y''' has the right to ask him to choose a singular term and substitute this term for the free variables in A[x].

The next section furnishes a brief overview of the rules for intuitionist logic and classical logic. For a complete formal formulation see {{harvtxt|Clerbout|2014}}, {{harvtxt|Rahman|McConaughey|Klev|Clerbout|2018}}, {{harvtxt|Rahman|Keiff|2005}}.

== The rules of the dialogical framework ==

=== The local meaning of the logical constants ===

* '''X''' A ∨ B &amp;nbsp;(A or B)

Challenge: '''Y''' ?

Defense: '''X''' A/'''X''' B

(Defender has the choice to defend A or to defend B)

* '''X''' A ∧ B &amp;nbsp;(A and B)

Challenge: '''Y''' ?L (for left)

Defense '''X''' A

Ataque: '''Y''' ?R (for right)

Defense '''X''' B

(Challenger has the choice to ask for A or to ask for B)

* '''X''' A⊃B &amp;nbsp;(If A then B)

Challenge: '''Y''' A

Defense: '''X''' B

(Challenger has the right to ask for A by conceding herself A)

* '''X''' ~A &amp;nbsp;(No A)

Challenge: '''Y''' A

Defense: (No defense is possible)

* '''X''' ∀xA[x] &amp;nbsp;(All x are A)

Challenge: '''Y''' ?t

Defense: '''X''' A[x/t]

(The challenger chooses)

* '''X''' ∃xA[x] &amp;nbsp;(At least one x is A)

Challenge: '''Y''' ?

Defense: '''X''' A[x/t]

(The defender chooses)

=== Structural rules: global meaning ===

===== RS 1 (Launching a dialogue or play) =====
Any play (dialogue)  starts with the Proponent '''P''' stating a thesis (labelled move 0) and the Opponent O bringing forward some initial statement (if any).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Here the term ''play'' is a synonym of ''dialogue'' in order to stress the fact that ''play'' is the fundamental notion of the dialogical framework.&lt;/ref&gt; The first move of '''O''', labelled with 1, is an attack to the thesis of the dialogue.

Each subsequent move consists of one of the two interlocutors, bringing forward in turn either an attack against a previous statement of the opponent, or a defense of a previous attack of the antagonist.

===== RS 2i (Intuitionist rule) =====
'''X''' can attack any statement brought forward by '''Y''', so far as the particle rules and the remaining structural rules allow it, or respond only to the '''''last non-answered''''' challenge of the other player.

''Note: This last clause is known as the'' Last Duty First''condition, and makes dialogical games suitable for intuitionistic logic (hence this rule's name).''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Challenges that are not have been responded yet are called ''open''. In this setting, an attack on a negation will always remain open, since, according to its local meaning-rule, there is no defense to an attack on a negation. However, there is a variant of the rule for local meaning, where the defence consists in stating ''falsum'' '''⊥'''. In the dialogical framework, the player who states ''falsum'' declares that he/she is giving up.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== RS 2c (Classical rule) =====
'''X''' can attack any statement brought forward by '''Y''', so far as the particle rules and the remaining structural rules allow it, or defend himself against any attack of '''Y''' (so far as the particle rules and the remaining structural rules allow it,)

===== RS 3 (Finiteness of plays) =====

====== ''Intuitionist rule'' ======
'''O''' can attack the same statement at most once.

'''P''' can attack the same statement some finite number of times.

====== ''Classic rule'' ======
'''O''' can attack the same statement or defend himself against an attack at most once.

'''P''' can an attack the same statement some finite number of times. The same restriction also holds for '''P''''s defences.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Notice that since according to the intuitionistic rule RS2i, players can only defend the last open attack, no restriction on defences are necessary. {{harvtxt|Felscher|1985}} and {{harvtxt|Piecha|2015}} after him, did not restrict the number of attacks. This triggers infinite plays.  Restrictions on the number of attacks and defences are known as ''repetitionranks''. The most through study of repetition ranks has been developed by {{harvtxt|Clerbout|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== RS 4 (Formal rule) =====
'''P''' can state an elementary proposition only if '''O''' has stated it before.

'''O''' always has the right to state elementary propositions (so far the rules of logical constants and other structural rules allow it).

Elementary propositions (in a formal dialogue) cannot be attacked.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A useful variant allows '''O''' to challenge elementary propositions. '''P''' defends against the attack with the indication ''sic n'', i.e.,&lt;nowiki&gt;''you already stated this proposition in your move n''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Marion called this variant the  ''Socratic rule''; see Marion/Rückert (2015).{{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RS5 (Winning and end of a play''')

The play ends when it is a player's turn to make a move but that player has no available move left. That player loses, the other player wins.

=== Validity and valid inferences ===
The notion of a winning a play is not enough to render the notion of inference or of logical validity.

In the following example, the thesis is of course not valid. However, '''P''' wins because '''O''' made the wrong choice. In fact, '''O''' loses the play since the structural rules do not allow her to challenge twice the same move.
{| class="wikitable"
!
!O
!P
!
|-
|
|
|A ∧ (A⊃A)
|0.
|-
|1.
|?D [0]
|A⊃A
|2.
|-
|3.
|A [2]
|A
|4.
|}
In move 0 ''P'' states the thesis. In move 2, ''O'' challenges the thesis by asking ''P'' to state the right component of the conjunction – the notation "[n]" indicates the number of the challenged move. In move 3 ''O'' challenges the 'implication by granting the antecedent. ''P'' responds to this challenge by stating the consequentn the just granted proposition A, and, since there are no other possible moves for '''O''', '''P''' wins.

There is obviously another play, where '''O''' wins, namely, asking for the left side of the conjunction.

Dually a valid thesis can be lost because '''P''' this time, makes the wrong choice. In the following example '''P''' loses the play (played according to the intuitionistic rules) by choosing the left side of the disjunction A ∨(A⊃A), since the intuitionistic rule SR 2i prevents him to come back and revise his choice:
{| class="wikitable"
!
!O
!P
!
|-
|
|
|(A ∧ B) ∨ (A⊃A)
|0.
|-
|1.
|?∨ [0]
|A ∧ B
|2.
|-
|3.
|?G [2]
|...
|
|}
Hence, winning a play does not ensure validity. In order to cast the notion of validity within the dialogical framework we need to define what a winning strategy is. In fact, there are several ways to do it. For the sake of a simple presentation we will yield a variation of {{harvtxt|Felscher|1985}}, however; different to his approach, we will not transform dialogues into tableaux but keep the distinction between play (a dialogue) and the tree of plays constituting a winning strategy.

==== Winning strategy ====

* A player '''X''' has a winning strategy if for every move made by the other player '''Y''', player '''X''' can make another move, such that each resulting play is eventually won by '''X'''.

In dialogical logic validity is defined in relation to winning strategies for the proponent '''P'''.

* A proposition is valid if '''P''' has a winning strategy for a thesis stating this proposition
* A ''winning strategy for'' '''P''' ''for'' a thesis ''A'' is a tree '''''S''''' the branches of which are plays won by '''P''', where the nodes are those moves, such that

# '''''S''''' has the move '''P''' ''A'' as root node (with depth 0),
# if the node is an '''O'''-move (i.e. if the depth of a node is odd), then it has exactly one successor node (which is a '''P'''-move),
# if the node is a '''P'''-move (i.e. if the depth of a node is even), then it has as many successor nodes as there are possible moves for '''O''' at this position.

Branches are introduced by '''O''''s choices such as when she challenges a conjunction or when she defends a disjunction.

===== Finite winning strategies =====
Winning strategies for quantifier-free formulas are always finite trees, whereas winning strategies for first-order formulas can, in general, be trees of countably infinitely many finite branches (each branch is a play).

For example, if one player states some universal quantifier, then each choice of the adversary triggers a different play. In the following example the thesis is an existential that triggers infinite branches, each of them constituted by a choice of '''P''':
{| class="wikitable"
!0.
!
!'''P'''∃x(A(x)⊃∀y A(y))
!
!
!
|-
|1.
|
|'''O''' ?∃
|
|
|
|-
|2.
|'''P'''A(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)⊃∀y A(y)
|'''P''' A(t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)⊃∀y A(y)
|'''P'''A(t&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)⊃∀y A(y)
|'''P'''A(t&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)⊃∀y A(y)
|...
|}
Infinite winning strategies for '''P''' can be avoided by introducing some restriction grounded on the following rationale

* Because of the formal rule,'''O''''s optimal move is to always choose a new term when she has the chance to choose, that is, when she challenges a universal or when she defends an existential.
* On the contrary '''P''', who will do his best to force O to state the elementary proposition she asked '''P''' for, will copy '''O''''s choices for a term (if '''O''''s provided already such a term) , when he challenges a universal of '''O''' or defends an existential.

These lead to the following restrictions:

# If the depth of a node ''n'' is even such that '''P''' stated a universal at ''n'', and if among the possible choice for '''O''' she can choose a new term, then this move counts as the only immediate successor node of ''n''.
# If the depth of a node ''n''is odd such that '''O''' stated an existential at ''n'', and if among the possible choices for '''O''' she can choose a new term, then this move counts as the only immediate successor node of ''m,'' i.e. the node where '''P''' launched the attack on ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;For example:
* {{cite book | last=Clerbout | first=N. | title=La sémantique dialogique. Notions fondamentales et éléments de metathéorie | series=Cahiers de Logique et d'Epistemologie | volume=21 | publisher=College Publications | location=London | date=2014 | isbn=978-1-84890-153-7 |ref=harv}}

# If it is '''P''' who has the choice, then only one of the plays triggered by the choice will be kept.

The rules for local and global meaning plus the notion of winning strategy mentioned above set the dialogical conception of classical and intuitionistic logic.

Herewith an example of a winning strategy for a thesis valid in classical logic and non-valid in intuitionistic logic
{| class="wikitable"
!
!
|-
|0.
|'''P'''∃x(A(x)⊃∀y A(y)) ('''P''' sets the thesis)
|-
|1.
|'''O''' ?∃ ('''O''' challenges the thesis)
|-
|2.
|'''P''' A(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)⊃∀y A(y) ('''P''' chooses "t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;")
|-
|3.
|'''O''' A(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ('''O''' challenges the implication by granting the antecedent)
|-
|4.
|'''P''' ∀y A(x) ('''P''' answers by stating the consequent)
|-
|5.
|'''O''' ?t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ('''O''' challenges the universal by choosing the new singular term "t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;")
|-
|6.
|'''P''' A(t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)⊃∀y A(y) ('''P''' cames back to his response to the challenge launched in move 1 chooses to defend the existential this time with the term "t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;")
|-
|7
|'''O''' A(t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ('''O''' challenges the implication by granting the antecedent)
|-
|8
|'''P''' A(t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ('''P''' &lt;nowiki&gt;''uses''&lt;/nowiki&gt;the last move of the Opponent to respond to the challenge upon the universal in move 5)
|}
'''P''' has a winning strategy since the SR 2c allows him to defend twice the challenge on the existential. This further allows him to defend himself in move 8 against the challenge launched by the Opponent in move 5.

Defending twice is not allowed by the intuitionistic rule SR 2i and accordingly, there is no winning strategy for '''P''':

Most of these developments are a result of studying the semantic and epistemological consequences of modifying the structural rules and/or of the logical constants. In fact, they show how to implement the ''dialogical conception of the structural rules for inference'', such as ''weakening'' and ''contraction''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This has been also studied in the context of cooperative dialogues for the search of structural rules; see Keiff (2007).{{Full citation needed|date=April 2020}} These results seems to have been unnoticed in {{harvtxt|Dutilh-Novaes|French|2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further publications show how to develop ''material dialogues'' (i.e., dialogues based on fully interpreted languages) that than dialogues restricted to [[Validity (logic)|logical validity]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;These publications respond to old and new criticism to dialogic logic such as the ones of {{harvtxt|Dutilh-Novaes|2015}} and {{harvtxt|Hodges|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This new approach to dialogues with content, called ''immanent reasoning'',&lt;ref&gt;For example:

      <text bytes="18306" xml:space="preserve">The phrase '''Reverence for Life''' is a translation of the [[German language|German]] phrase: "'''{{lang|de|Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben}}'''."  These words came to [[Albert Schweitzer]] on a boat trip on the [[Ogooué River]] in [[French Equatorial Africa]] (now [[Gabon]]), while searching for a universal concept of [[ethics]] for our time.

Schweitzer made the phrase the basic tenet of an ethical [[philosophy]], which he developed and put into practice. He gave expression to its development in numerous books and publications during his life and also in manuscripts which have recently been published; the main work being his unfinished four-part ''[[Philosophy of Culture]]'' ({{lang-de|Kulturphilosophie}}) subtitled: "The World-view of Reverence for Life". He also used his [[Albert Schweitzer Hospital|hospital]] in [[Lambaréné]] in [[Gabon]] (Central Africa) to demonstrate this philosophy in practice.

He believed that Reverence for Life is a concept that develops from observation of the world around us. In 'Civilization and Ethics' he expressed this in these words:

{{quote |"Ethics is nothing other than Reverence for Life.

Reverence for Life affords me my fundamental principle of morality, namely, that good consists in maintaining, assisting and enhancing life, and to destroy, to harm or to hinder life is evil." | Albert Schweitzer}}

James Brabazon (Author of the  Biography of [[Albert Schweitzer]]) defined Reverence for Life with the following statement:

{{quote |"Reverence for Life says that the only thing we are really sure of is that we live and want to go on living. This is something that we share with everything else that lives, from elephants to blades of grass—and, of course, every human being. So we are brothers and sisters to all living things, and owe to all of them the same care and respect, that we wish for ourselves."| James Brabazon}}

[[Albert Schweitzer]] hoped that the ethic of Reverence for Life would make its way in the world on the basis of his explanation of it in his books and talks, the example of his life and the force of its own argument based on the depth of fundamental thought. To some extent this is taking place as is evidenced by the growth of the [[environmental movement]]. (The book ''[[Silent Spring]]'', by [[Rachel Carson|Rachael Carson]], which is widely credited with helping launch the environmental movement,&lt;ref&gt;Josie Glausiusz. (2007), Better Planet: Can A Maligned Pesticide Save Lives? ''Discover Magazine''.  Page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; was dedicated to [[Albert Schweitzer]].)

==Origins of Albert Schweitzer’s "Reverence for Life"==

Albert Schweitzer believed that ethical values which could underpin the ideal of true [[civilization]] had to have their foundation in deep thought and be world- and life-affirming. He therefore embarked on a search for [[ethical value]]s in the various major religions and world-views accessible to him, but could not find any that were able, unequivocally, to combine ethics with life-affirmation. It was not until two years after moving out to [[Gabon]] to establish the [[hospital|Albert Schweitzer Hospital]] that he finally found the simple statement which answered his quest.

In his autobiography "Out of My Life and Thought," Schweitzer explains this process.

"Having described how at the beginning of the summer of 1915 he awoke from some kind of mental daze, asking himself why he was only criticizing civilization and not working on something constructive.".&lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke , translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). p147. {{ISBN|0801894123}}&lt;/ref&gt; He relates how he asked himself the question:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But what is civilization?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The essential element in civilization is the ethical perfecting of the individual as well as society. At the same time, every spiritual and every material step forward has significance for civilization. The will to civilization is, then, the universal will to progress that is conscious of the ethical as the highest value. In spite of the great importance we attach to the achievements of science and human prowess, it is obvious that only a humanity that is striving for ethical ends can benefit in full measure from material progress and can overcome the dangers that accompany it.....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only possible way out of chaos is for us to adopt a concept of the world based on the ideal of true civilization.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But what is the nature of that concept of the world in which the will to the general progress and the will to the ethical progress join and are linked?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It consists in an ethical affirmation of the world and of life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is affirmation of the world and of life?....&lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke , translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). p148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For months on end, I lived in a continual state of mental agitation. Without the least success I concentrated - even during my daily work at the hospital - on the real nature of the affirmation of life and of ethics, and on the question of what they have in common. I was wandering about in a thicket where no path was to be found. I was pushing against an iron door that would not yield....&lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke , translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). p154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In that mental state, I had to take a long journey up the river . . . Lost in thought, I sat on deck of the barge, struggling to find the elementary and universal concept of the ethical that I had not discovered in any philosophy. I covered sheet after sheet with disconnected sentences merely to concentrate on the problem. Two days passed. Late on the third day, at the very moment when, at sunset, we were making our way through a herd of hippopotamuses, there flashed upon my mind, unforeseen and unsought, the phrase : “'''Reverence for Life'''”. [lang|de| Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben] The iron door had yielded. The path in the thicket had become visible. Now I had found my way to the principle in which affirmation of the world and ethics are joined together!” &lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke , translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). pp154-55. Emphasis added. [This edition leaves out the original German phrase, so another edition needs to be cited as well which contains the German phrase as shown above.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;-- [[Albert Schweitzer]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

According to some authors, Schweitzer's thought, and specifically his development for reverence for life, was influenced by [[Indian religions|Indian religious]] thought and in particular [[Jain]] principle of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (non-violence).&lt;ref&gt;Ara Paul Barsam (2002) "Albert Schweitzer, jainism and reverence for life" in:''Reverence for life: the ethics of Albert Schweitzer for the twenty-first century'' Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8156-2977-1}} p. 207-08&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Schweitzer has noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book ''Indian Thought and Its Development'':&lt;ref&gt;Albert Schweitzer and Charles Rhind Joy (1947) ''Albert Schweitzer: an anthology'' Beacon Press&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The laying down of the commandment to not kill and to not damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind. Starting from its principle, founded on world and life denial, of abstention from action, ancient Indian thought - and this is a period when in other respects ethics have not progressed very far - reaches the tremendous discovery that ethics know no bounds. So far as we know, this is for the first time clearly expressed by Jainism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should not be overlooked, however, that as a child he felt deeply for the suffering of all the creatures around him. It beat upon him. He wrote, "As far back as I can remember I was saddened by the amount of misery I saw in the world around me. Youth's unqualified joie de vivre I never really knew...One thing especially saddened me was that the unfortunate animals had to suffer so much pain and misery....It was quite incomprehensible to me -- this was before I began going to school -- why in my evening prayers I should pray for human beings only. So when my mother had prayed with me and had kissed me good-night, I used to add silently a prayer that I composed myself for all living creatures. It ran thus: "O heavenly Father, protect and bless all things that have breath guard them from all evil, and let them sleep in peace...." &lt;ref&gt;''Albert Schweitzer: Essential Writings'', compiled by James Brabazon. p. 117-120&lt;/ref&gt;

Schweitzer twice went fishing with some boys "because they asked [him] to" and "this sports was soon made impossible for me by the treatment of the worms that were put on the hook...and the wrenching of the mouths of the fishes that were caught. I gave it up...From experiences like these, which moved my heart....there slowly grew up in me an unshakeable conviction that we have no right to inflict suffering and death on another living creature, and that we ought all of us to feel what a horrible thing it is to cause suffering and death..." &lt;ref&gt;''Albert Schweitzer: Essential Writings'', compiled by James Brabazon. p. 117–120&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Reverence for Life was incipient in Schweizer almost from birth.

This awareness affected him throughout his life, as when he would carefully, gently scoop a spider out of a hole it had fallen into before planting a crop there, to feed his patients and their families who also worked on the hospital farm. He wrote that, just as our own existence is significance to each of us, "[a creature's] existence is significant to it."&lt;ref&gt;''Reverence for Life: The Words of Albert Schweitzer''. compiled by Harold E. Robles. Pub. Harpercollins; 1st edition (October 1993). {{ISBN|0060670983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote that "...my relation to my own being and to the objective world is determined by reverence for life. This reverence for life is given as an element of my will-to-live..." and this will-to-live existed in all creatures and was to be respected.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of Civilization.'' Albert Schweitzer. Prometheus Books (March 1, 1987). {{ISBN|0879754036}}. p xv. See also this same topic of will-to-live in ''Out of My Life and Thought.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child he was taught, and later as an adult taught his congregations, the "fundamental truths of the religion of Jesus as something not hostile to reason, but, on the contrary, as strengthening them." &lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke, translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). p 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many later thanked him, saying that this teaching had "helped them to keep their religion in later life."  A great mind, he went through "heaps of books" which were piled so high he had to make aisles to get through them.&lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke, translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). pp 46 and 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the life of Jesus in a depth few have ever achieved. His own philosophy, which came to be encapsulated in the phrase Reverence for Life, had this bedrock in the Four Gospels of the New Testament.

In his book ''The Philosophy of Civilization'', Schweitzer wrote, "Ethics are responsibility without limit toward all that lives....Love means more, since it includes fellowship in suffering, in joy, and in effort...&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of Civilization.'' Albert Schweitzer. Prometheus Books (March 1, 1987). {{ISBN|0879754036}}. p  317.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The will to live==

The word ‘will’ in the sense of determination or firmness of purpose is rarely used today and therefore Schweitzer’s use of the word as translated from the German word ‘Wille’ may appear unfamiliar. However, it is a significant part of Schweitzer’s message. He held the view in the 1920s that people had largely lost touch with their own will, having subjugated it to outside authority and sacrificed it to external circumstances.

He therefore pointed back to that elemental part of ourselves that can be in touch with our ‘will’ and can exercise it for the good of all.

In ''Out of My Life and Thought'' Schweitzer wrote:

{{Quote|The most immediate fact of man’s consciousness is the assertion "I am life that wills to live in the midst of life that wills to live"|Albert Schweitzer&lt;ref&gt;A. Schweitzer, ''Out of my Life and Thought'' (Johns Hopkins University Press 1998), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Affirmation of life is the spiritual act by which man ceases to live thoughtlessly and begins to devote himself to his life with reverence in order to give it true value. To affirm life is to deepen, to make more inward, and to exalt the will to live.

At the same time the man who has become a thinking being feels a compulsion to give to every will to live the same reverence for life that he gives to his own.[....] This is the absolute, fundamental principle of ethics, and is a fundamental postulate of thought.| Albert Schweitzer&lt;ref&gt;A. Schweitzer, ''Out of my Life and Thought'' (Johns Hopkins University Press 1998), 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his search for an answer to the problems posed by what was to him the obvious decline of western civilization, Albert Schweitzer was not prepared to give up the belief in progress which is so much taken for granted by people of European descent. Rather, he sought to identify why this ‘will to progress’ was seemingly going off the rails and causing the disintegration of European civilization.

He came to the following conclusion: (''Out of my Life and Thought'')

{{Quote|By itself, the affirmation of life can only produce a partial and imperfect civilization. Only if it turns inward and becomes ethical can the will to progress attain the ability to distinguish the valuable from the worthless. We must therefore strive for a civilization that is not based on the accretion of science and power alone, but which cares most of all for the spiritual and ethical development of the individual and of humankind.|Albert Schweitzer&lt;ref&gt;A. Schweitzer, ''Out of my Life and Thought'' (Johns Hopkins University Press 1998), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Standing, as all living beings are, before this dilemma of the will to live, a person is constantly forced to preserve his own life and life in general only at the cost of other life. If he has been touched by the ethic of reverence for life, he injures and destroys life only under a necessity he cannot avoid, and never from thoughtlessness. |Albert Schweitzer&lt;ref&gt;A. Schweitzer, ''Out of my Life and Thought'' (Johns Hopkins University Press 1998), 236.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Medium Essentialism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] stating that each [[art]]form has its own distinctive [[Artistic medium|medium]], and that the [[essence]] of such an artform is dependent on its particular medium.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd|year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=113–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the theory argues that every artwork should manifest its [[Essentialism|essential]] properties, those which no other artform can employ. The theory relies on the [[presumption]] that every artform has a unique medium, and is divided into two main interpretations. The ‘limitation’ interpretation of Medium Essentialism argues that, due to their medium, some artforms should be constrained in their aspirations. The ‘productive’ interpretation reasons that a work's medium determines what content or style will function best, and that practitioners should pursue ventures aligning with the nature of this chosen medium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Clement Greenberg]] is a prolific medium-essentialist in relation to [[Modernist art|modernist]] [[Visual arts|art]], proposing that artists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] are successful because they properly exploit elements of their chosen medium, such as a painting's physical flatness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreyach|first=Michael|date=Spring 2015|title=Re-created Flatness: Hans Hofmann's Concept of the Picture Plane as a Medium of Expression|url=https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=art_faculty|journal=The Journal of Aesthetic Education|volume=49|issue=1|pages=57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Medium Essentialism was most propagated by [[film]] [[Filmmaker|practitioners]] throughout the twentieth century, as it legitimised [[Cinematography|cinema]] as an artform for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd|year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, film had been regarded as merely a recorded representation of a written play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Film History: An Introduction|last=Bordwell|first=David|last2=Thompson|first2=Kristin|publisher=McGraw-Hill Company Inc |year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, USA|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore most discussed today by film theorists, stemming from the work of critics such as [[André Bazin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Donald|date=July 1969|title=Reviewed Work: What Is Cinema? by André Bazin, Hugh Gray|url=|journal=Journal of Aesthetic Education|volume=3|issue=3|pages=159–161|doi=10.2307/3331711|jstor=3331711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the interpretation favoured, what constitutes a film's medium, and therefore essential meaning, has been heavily debated,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy and Film|last=Livingston|first=Paisley|last2=Plantinga|first2=Carl|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2012|isbn=9781281838032|location=|pages=205|oclc=830038431}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has prompted the creation of several sub-theories. The theory has been widely discussed among contemporary film theorists&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images|last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9781441122575|location=|pages=23–24|oclc=1043047181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has featured in the Anthology of the Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd |year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Whilst Medium Essentialism is not merely a subcategory of the [[Essentialism]] theory,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; it is relevant to the notion that certain characteristics are integral to every entity's purpose and [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Richard L.|year=1968|title=Some Remarks on Essentialism|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=65|issue=20|pages=615–626 |doi=10.2307/2024315|jstor=2024315}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-essentialism]] rejects the existence of such an 'essence'. Non-essentialism has been the view preferred by scholars such as [[Noël Carroll]], criticising Medium Essentialism in relation to film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd |year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dream Medium Essentialism ==
[[File:The-Love-Light-Poster.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Theatrical release poster for [[The Love Light]], a 1921 [[Silent film|silent]] [[drama]] film that [[Susanne Langer|Langer]] argues demonstrates the movement of mainstream film from simple entertainment into an artform.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reflections on art: a source book of writings by artists, critics, and philosophers|last=Langer|first=Susanne K. |date=1979|publisher=Arno Press|isbn=0405106114|location=|pages=62|oclc=470851789}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The sub-theory of Dream Medium Essentialism states that a film's essence is dependent upon its medium, adding that a film's medium is to be found in its creator's [[intention]] or ‘dream’.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Susanne Langer|Susanne K. Langer]], within her book 'Feeling and Form' posited this idea.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feeling and Form|last=Langer|first=Susanne|publisher=Pearson|year=1977|isbn=0023675004|location=|pages=4–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langer reasoned that film had become its own medium through its use of 'the dream mode', or a direct visual portrayal of an artist's intentions and/or imagination. She pinpointed the time during which cinema began to classify itself as an artform as the early 1920s. She cited films such as [[The Love Light]] and [[The Blacksmith]] as demonstrating a shift from practitioners creating humorous entertainment or historically accurate texts, to an expression of artistic intentions that result in film being classified as a "new poetic mode."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Langer stated that, "The most noteworthy formal characteristic of dream" is that the dreamer "is always at the center of it",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd|year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dreamer in this case representing a filmmaker. Langer proposed that a film's essence is determined by its medium (Medium Essentialism), and that its medium is determined by the 'dream' of its creator, director or practitioner.

[[Noël Carroll|Noel Carroll]], however, rejects both Medium Essentialism and Langer's definition of a film's medium as constituted by its creator's 'dream'.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Carroll rebukes Langer's statement that the dreamer is 'always at the centre of' the film and that that proves the 'dream' as constituting a film's meaning/essence. He proposes that the "film viewer is not in the center of the array. She is typically off to one side."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Livingston proposes that Carroll misreads Langer's argument, when it actually refers to the film creator - not the film consumer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Carroll also quotes fellow anti-essentialist critic [[Stanley Cavell]], who argues that dreams are often "boring narratives...their skimpy surface out of all proportion with their riddle interest and their effect on the dreamer."&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Jinhee; Carroll, Noel (2005). ''Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology''. Oxford, United Kingdom: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. pp. 61. {{ISBN|1405120274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photography Medium Essentialism ==
[[Roger Scruton]]'s 'Philosophy of Representation' also agrees with the premise of Medium Essentialism in relation to film.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Jinhee; Carroll, Noel (2005). ''Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology''. Oxford, United Kingdom: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. pp. 8. {{ISBN|1405120274}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he proposes that since a photograph is [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]], it cannot constitute the [[essence]] of a work as it cannot express thought about its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images |last=Sinnerbrink |first=Robert |date=2018|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9781441122575|location=|pages=41|oclc=1043047181}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument relies on the presumption that every artform must be defined by an intention or thought, and not merely its physical substance. This perspective posits that the medium and essence of a photo or film-based artwork must be determined non-materially.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jarvie|first=Ian|date=August 1995 |title=Sir Karl Popper (1902–94): Essentialism And Historicism In Film Methodology|url=|journal=Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television|volume=15|pages=301–305|doi=10.1080/01439689500260181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerically, his argument is as follows:

# A text's 'essence' must express an opinion regarding its subject.
# Photography is a transparent representation, and cannot express opinion of any sort.
# Film is, at its most essential, a photograph of a dramatic representation, and does not contain opinion.
# The essence of a film cannot lie in its material photography.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Whilst not detailing the place that a film's medium (and therefore essence) should be found in, Scruton's theory rules out any physical location that a film's medium and essence could be found in.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Jinhee; Carroll, Noel (2005). ''Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology''. Oxford, United Kingdom: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. pp. 8–16. {{ISBN|1405120274}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It thereby indirectly supports Dream Medium Essentialism.

=== Balázs' Requirement of Intention ===
[[File:Balázs Béla.jpg|thumb|[[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[Film criticism|film critic]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthete]] [[Béla Balázs]], c. 1910s. Balázs was a key proponent of the idea that a film's physical material alone cannot constitute its essence or medium.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;]]
In addition to Scruton's proposition, [[Béla Balázs]] argued that as a film's physical constitution is transparent, it cannot carry any meaning about its content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Gertrud|last2=Hansen|first2=Miriam|date=1987|title=Bela Balazs: The Physiognomy of Things|journal=New German Critique|issue=40|pages=167–177|doi=10.2307/488137|issn=0094-033X|jstor=488137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balázs proposes, therefore, that an artform's essence must carry an intention about its subject - and this intention cannot be found within a film's photographic or audio elements.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Soul of Film Theory|last=Cooper|first=Sarah|publisher=|year=1971|isbn=9780230365131|location=|pages=57–58|oclc=825047285}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, whilst a musical composition or an oil painting provides an opinion about its subject (due to the intention required by creating an artwork from scratch), a photograph cannot in itself contain artistic intention without additional elements being considered, such as a directorial vision or lighting.

== Editing Medium Essentialism ==
Soviet theorists [[Dziga Vertov]], [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein]] also concur with Medium Essentialism, adding that a film's medium (and therefore essence) lies in its [[Film editing|editing]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Film, Art, New Media: Museum Without Walls?|last=Dalle Vacche|first=Angela|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1137026132|location=New York, USA|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pudovkin's essay 'The Plastic Material' (1929) proposes that the manipulation of [[celluloid]] (or in the twenty-first century, [[digital editing]]) is what defines a film's medium.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This process would involve the physical alteration of photographic material, as well as intellectual engagement with what images a film should contain, in relation to the artistic intention of the filmmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Film, Art, New Media: Museum Without Walls?|last=Dalle Vacche |first=Angela |publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1137026132|location=New York, USA|pages=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a work's essence would be constituted by its medium, which is made up of the editing involved in filmwork. This editing, in turn, is fulfilled by physical editing of collected material, as well as a consideration of how that material fits with the overarching intention of the filmmaker. This intention may be related to a plot, or a broader artistic vision.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Concerned with a film's materiality, Pudovkin's interpretation of Medium Essentialism is agreed upon by later publications, including D.N. Rodowick's The Virtual Life of Film (2007), [[Mary Ann Doane|Mary Ann Doane's]] The Emergence of Cinematic Time (2002), and [[Phil Rosen|Phil Rosen's]] Change Mummified (2001).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Dziga Vertov|Vertov]] added to this sub-theory, arguing that editing techniques constitute the film's [[Semiotics|semiotic]] system,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;MICHELSON, Annette, and Kevin O’Brien (1985). ''Kino-eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which contains the visual and auditory editing that manipulate recorded images - to the extent that they can create a sequence that has a particular outcome for the film holistically, as an artform in itself.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Eisenstein was also a proponent of Editing Medium Essentialism, and within his essay 'Montage of Attractions', reiterated the idea that sound and image editing can be so transformative for the film and the narrative it tells that editing may be considered the essence of a film.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walley|first=Jonathan|date=2003|title=The Material of Film and the Idea of Cinema: Contrasting Practices in Sixties and Seventies Avant-Garde Film|journal=October|volume=103|pages=15–30|doi=10.1162/016228703762874197|issn=0162-2870}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that montage was the defining characteristic of a film's medium and essence,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; which is necessarily brought about by editing. He proposes that montage cannot simply be found in film and other photographic mediums such as Japanese [[Pictogram|pictographic]] writing, but also in natural phenomena like [[human perception]] more generally. Eisenstein claims that the medium of film, and the [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] it contains, is a satisfaction of the human desire for an artform that contains this montage.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Reality Medium Essentialism ==
[[Stanley Cavell]] proposes that a film's essence is defined by its medium, and that that medium lies partly within a film's portrayal of an illusion of reality, "Not by literally presenting us with a world, but by permitting us to view it unseen […] we are displaced from our natural habitation within it, placed at a distance from it."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Film |last=Cavell |first=Stanley |publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1971|isbn=9780674961968|location=Harvard University, USA|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavell proposed that a film's medium lies in its projection of reality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Film|last=Cavell|first=Stanley|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1971|isbn=9780674961968|location=Harvard University, USA|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that is heavily contested by scholars such as Noël Carroll, as his argument relies on the premise that a film's value is determined by how well it represents reality for audiences. Cavell has an almost non-essential conception of a film's medium,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; yet still subscribes to medium essentialism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He argues a film's medium lies not within its physical material, but by the way in which it represents reality through an artform's ongoing re-invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images |last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9781441122575|location=|pages=28|oclc=1043047181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the example of a 1975 [[Russian film|Russian]] [[art film]], [[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]], Cavell proposes that a filmmaker's accurate portrayal of reality from the perspective of a certain protagonist is what constitutes a film's medium, and therefore essence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Medium Essentialism has been criticised as heavily as it has been praised,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Appreciating the Art of Television: a Philosophical Perspective |last=Nannicelli |first=Ted|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2016|isbn=9781315732633|location=|pages=53|oclc=1009105087}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many considering the theory 'narrow'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreyach|first=Michael|date=Spring 2015|title=Re-created Flatness: Hans Hofmann's Concept of the Picture Plane as a Medium of Expression|url=https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=art_faculty|journal=The Journal of Aesthetic Education|volume=49|issue=1|pages=58|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most critics of the idea reject the premise that every artform has a distinctive medium which necessarily determines its essence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[V. F. Perkins|V.F. Perkins]] was one of the first critics of the theory, who in the 1970s proposed that no one aspect of the film medium (photographic production, specifically) is superior to its counterparts (such as artistic intention or soundtrack).&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Philosophies of Film: Thinking Images|last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1441146199|location=Bloomsbury, UK|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noël Carroll]] is regarded as the most comprehensive critic of the theory.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; His argument, within 'Theorising the Moving Image,' holds that Medium Essentialism is an inaccurate way to evaluate a work - as it requires the distillation of a film to one medium, when a film is constituted by not one, but several mediums. These mediums may include editing, lighting, narrative, photography, colour, and artistic intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd|year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=68–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a film as not containing one medium but several, can be interpreted in any number of ways, with some defining medium as an artist's intention and photography, others by audio editing, narrative, and artistic intention. Carroll takes issue with the presumptions held by Medium Essentialism, that each artform holds a unique medium, that that medium determines an arform's essence, and that an artform's content is determined by that medium.&lt;ref&gt;Sinnerbrink, Robert (2011). ''New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images''. Continuum. pp. 21. {{ISBN|9781441122575}}. {{OCLC|1043047181}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll argues that theorists must "forget the medium"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sankowski|first=Edward|date=Spring 2006|title=Film Studies, the Moving Image, and Noël Carroll|url=|journal=Journal of Aesthetic Education|volume=40|issue=1|pages=104–110|via=JSTOR|doi=10.1353/jae.2006.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to understand the aesthetic possibilities that film contains, and criticises the essentialist arguments of works such as [[Siegfried Kracauer|Siegfried Kracauer's]] 'Theory of Film', which avoided an exploration of the essence of film, yet still was preoccupied with a film-specific aesthetic as a result of the film medium, and nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlüpmann|first=Heide|last2=Y. Levin|first2=Thomas|date=Winter 1987|title=Phenomenology of Film: On Siegfried Kracauer's Writings of the 1920s|url=|journal=New German Critique|volume=40|pages=98–99|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Robert Sinnerbrink]] within 'New Philosophies of Film: Thinking Images' argues that a film contains a multitude of elements, whilst medium essentialism requires a single, prescriptive and rigid one.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Drawing from ''[[Cinema 1: The Movement Image]],'' which was the first published consolidation of film theory,&lt;ref&gt;Phil Powrie, Keith Reader (2002). ''French Cinema: A Student's Guide'', Oxford University Press(US), p77. {{ISBN|0-340-76004-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinnerbrink proposes that each film's "movement-image"&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gehman, Steve Reinke (2005). ''The Sharpest Point: animation at the end of cinema'', YYZ Books, p12. {{ISBN|0-920397-32-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or how a figure is created through the continuity of their movement, is that which defines it, in combination with a number of other elements.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This position, therefore, denounces the idea that an artform's essence is determined by one specific medium. Citing the example of [[Derek Jarman|Derek Jarman's]] [[Blue (1993 film)|Blue]] (1993), Sinnerbrink argues that the film's engaging voiceover narration, effective use of colour, exciting background music and plot cannot be distilled into a single 'relevant medium'.&lt;ref&gt;Sinnerbrink, Robert (2018). ''New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images''. Continuum. p. 22-23. {{ISBN|9781441122575}}. {{OCLC|1043047181}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Rancière]] is also a critic of Medium Essentialism, proposing that no film has an essence particular to its medium, and that any essence or single medium cannot be determined by any film in [[History of film|cinematic history]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Sinnerbrink, Robert (2018). ''New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images''. Continuum. p. 100-102. {{ISBN|9781441122575}}. {{OCLC|1043047181}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reiterating the unsolvable conflict between 'visual spectacle' and 'narrative content' faced by critics when attempting to distill film into a single essential medium,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Rancière states that 'essentialising' the film medium often comes at the price of being unable to see the film as a whole, as a 'corpus'.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

'''Biosophy''', meaning ''wisdom of life'', is "the science and art of intelligent living based on the awareness and practice of spiritual values, ethical-social principles and character qualities essential to [[individual freedom]] and social harmony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biosophicalinstitute.tripod.com/objectives.htm |title=Objectives of Biosophy |publisher=Biosophicalinstitute.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands in relation to [[biology]], which can be broadly described as the ''understanding of life''.

==History==
The term ''Biosophy'' was probably first used in 1806 by [[Ignaz Paul Vitalis Troxler]], a Swiss philosopher whose early works followed [[F. W. J. Schelling]]. It was later used by other philosophers like [[Peter Wessel Zapffe]] (1899–1990), who used [[biology]] as the foundation of his [[philosophy]]. Zapffe first set out his ideas in ''Den sidste Messias'' (en. ''[[The Last Messiah]]'') (1933). Later Zapffe gave a more systematic defence in his philosophical treatise ''[[Om det tragiske]]'' (en. ''[[On the tragic]]'') (1941). The Biosophical Institute claims that [[Frederick Kettner]] (1886-1957) was the founder of Biosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biosophicalinstitute.tripod.com/kettner.htm |title=Dr. Frederick Kettner |publisher=Biosophicalinstitute.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kettner was himself originally inspired by the [[organicism]] of [[Constantin Brunner]].

Contemporary biosophers include [[Jong Bhak]], who defines Biosophy as a "new way of performing philosophy generated from scientific and biological awareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biosophy.org/index.php/Main_Page |title=Main Page - Biosophy_org |publisher=Biosophy.org |date=2015-02-28 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhak developed his theory of Biosophy while studying at Cambridge University in 1995 and afterwards. The main difference of Bhak's biosophy from other philosophy is that his biosophy is a computable philosophy. It borrows [[Bertrand Russell]] logicism and extends it to a computational set of ideas and knowledge. One ultimate aim of biosophy is to construct a logical [[Artificial intelligence|thinking machine]] that can do philosophy for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biosophy.org |title=Main Page - Biosophy_org |publisher=Biosophy.org |date=2015-02-28 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosophy Program==
The Biosophy Program was presented on the Internet by Anna Öhman &amp; Svenolov Lindgren in January 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/biosophy/ |title=BIOSOPHY [Lundsbergs skola, Sweden&amp;#93; |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2015-09-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026234617/http://geocities.com/biosophy/ |archivedate=October 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that "the term biosophy was previously used by Zapffe (1941) in a literary context for the analysis of human social life based on philosophy of existence and biological facts. Such a narrow circumscription of biosophy is in our opinion no obstacle to widen the definition to encompass all systematic thinking on biological issues."

The Biosophy Program was intended to circumscribe and systemize biological studies in a philosophical framework to support teaching at courses on philosophy and courses on biology. The biosophical thinking is defined by Öhman &amp; Lindgren in five philosophical fields and discriminated from Næss’ ecosophy.

==Objectives==
* To create biosophical groups for character and peace education where the individual has opportunities of [[self-improvement]].
* To encourage integration among individuals based on their mutual interest in a spiritual purpose in life.
* To network with other groups and organizations interested in character and peace education working cooperatively with them.
* To replace the blind acceptance of theological beliefs, [[superstition]]s and [[dogma]]s with the cultivation of spiritual intelligence as the basis for the Religion of Freedom and Friendship.
* To create a world-fellowship of [[peace]]-loving human beings who have overcome religious, national, racial and social [[prejudice]]s who can work creatively for the growth of democracy, spiritual personal growth and [[world peace]].
* To work for the synthesis of religion, philosophy, science, education and art.
* To perpetuate and advance Kettner's principles and work for the development and cultivation of the character and peace nature in young people.
* To create a Peace Department in national governments headed by a Secretary of Peace, and to establish peace universities.
* To establish a world-fellowship of thinking human beings who can work creatively for the growth of spiritual [[democracy]] and world peace.
* To cooperate in the advancement of humanity from [[civilization]] to the age of "soulization".

'''Process philosophy''' — also '''ontology of becoming''', '''processism''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Process Metaphysics: An Introduction to Process Philosophy'', SUNY Press, 1996, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''philosophy of organism'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy Emmet]], 1932, ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism'', London: Macmillan; 2nd edn, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; — identifies [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[reality]] with [[Change (philosophy)|change]]. In opposition to the classical model of change as illusory (as argued by [[Parmenides]]) or accidental (as argued by Aristotle), process philosophy regards change as the cornerstone of reality—the cornerstone of [[being]] thought of as [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]].

Since the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], some philosophers have posited true reality as "timeless", based on permanent [[Substance theory|substance]]s, while processes are denied or subordinated to timeless substances. If [[Socrates]] changes, becoming sick, Socrates is still the same (the substance of Socrates being the same), and change (his sickness) only glides over his substance: change is accidental, whereas the substance is essential. Therefore, classic [[ontology]] denies any full reality to change, which is conceived as only accidental and not essential. This classical ontology is what made knowledge and a [[theory of knowledge]] possible, as it was thought that a science of something in becoming was an impossible feat to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fagot-Largeau, [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm 7 December 2006 course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} at the [[Collège of France]], first part of a series of courses on the "Ontology of Becoming" {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who appeal to process rather than substance include [[Heraclitus]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24196-marx-and-whitehead-process-dialectics-and-the-critique-of-capitalism/ Marx and Whitehead: Process, Dialectics, and the Critique of Capitalism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]],  [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Thomas Nail]], [[Alfred Korzybski]], [[R. G. Collingwood]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Robert M. Pirsig]], [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]],  [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Arran Gare]], [[Nicholas Rescher]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Tim Ingold]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. In physics, [[Ilya Prigogine]]&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Prigogine, ''From being to becoming'', [[David Bohm]], "Wholeness and the Implicate Order", W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between the "physics of being" and the "physics of becoming". Process philosophy covers not just scientific intuitions and experiences, but can be used as a conceptual bridge to facilitate discussions among religion, philosophy, and science.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Jeremy R. Hustwit|title=Process Philosophy: 2.a. In Pursuit of a Holistic Worldview |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/#SH2a|encyclopedia=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to [[Continental philosophy]] than [[analytic philosophy]], because it is usually only taught in Continental departments.&lt;ref&gt;William Blattner, [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html "Some Thoughts About "Continental" and "Analytic" Philosophy"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus Continental methods in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Seibt |first=Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Gaskill, A. J. Nocek, ''The Lure of Whitehead'', University of Minnesota Press, 2014, p. 4: "it is no wonder that Whitehead fell by the wayside. He was too scientific for the "continentals," not scientific enough for the "analytics," and too metaphysical—which is to say [[Critical philosophy|uncritical]]—for them both" and p. 231: "the analytics and Continentals are both inclined toward [[Kantianism|Kantian]] presuppositions in a manner that Latour and Whitehead brazenly renounce."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== In ancient Greek thought ===

Heraclitus proclaimed that the basic nature of all things is change.

The quotation from [[Heraclitus]] appears in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' twice; in 401d as:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' Paragraph [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DCrat.%3Asection%3D401d Crat. 401 section d line 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|τὰ ὄντα ἰέναι τε πάντα καὶ μένειν οὐδέν}}&lt;br/&gt;''Ta onta ienai te panta kai menein ouden''&lt;br/&gt;"All entities move and nothing remains still"&lt;/blockquote&gt;and in 402a&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+402&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 Paragraph 402 section a line 8].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|"πάντα χωρεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει" καὶ "δὶς ἐς τὸν αὐτὸν ποταμὸν οὐκ ἂν ἐμβαίης"}}&lt;br/&gt;''Panta chōrei kai ouden menei kai dis es ton auton potamon ouk an embaies''
&lt;br /&gt;"Everything changes and nothing remains still&amp;nbsp;... and&amp;nbsp;... you cannot step twice into the same stream"&lt;ref&gt;This sentence has been translated by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] in Epistulae, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep6.shtml VI, 58, 23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus considered fire as the most fundamental element.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=William|title=Heraclitus: The Complete Philosophical Fragments|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/Philosophy/Heraclitus.html|website=Middlebury College|accessdate=3 October 2015|ref=DK B90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is an interpretation of Heraclitus's concepts into modern terms by Nicholas Rescher.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...reality is not a constellation of things at all, but one of processes.  The fundamental "stuff" of the world is not material substance, but volatile flux, namely "fire", and all things are versions thereof (puros tropai).  Process is fundamental: the river is not an object, but a continuing flow; the sun is not a thing, but an enduring fire.  Everything is a matter of process, of activity, of change (panta rhei)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rescher|first1=Nicholas|title=Process philosophy a survey of basic issues|date=2000|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=[Pittsburgh]|isbn=0822961288|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An early expression of this viewpoint is in [[Heraclitus]]'s fragments. He posits strife, ''ἡ ἔρις'' (strife, conflict), as the underlying basis of all reality defined by change.&lt;ref&gt;Wheelwright, P. (1959). ''Heraclitus'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|0-19-924022-1}}, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance and opposition in strife were the foundations of change and stability in the flux of existence.

===Twentieth century===
In early twentieth century, the [[philosophy of mathematics]] was undertaken to develop mathematics as an airtight, axiomatic system in which every truth could be derived logically from a set of axioms. In the [[foundations of mathematics]], this project is variously understood as [[logicism]] or as part of the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] program of [[David Hilbert]]. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to complete, or at least facilitate, this program with their seminal book [[Principia Mathematica]], which purported to build a logically consistent [[set theory]] on which to found mathematics. After this, Whitehead extended his interest to natural science, which he held needed a deeper philosophical basis. He intuited that natural science was struggling to overcome a traditional ontology of timeless material substances that does not suit natural phenomena. According to Whitehead, material is more properly understood as 'process'. In 1929, he produced the most famous work of process philosophy, ''[[Process and Reality]]'',&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; continuing the work begun by [[Hegel]] but describing a more complex and fluid dynamic ontology.

Process thought describes truth as "movement" in and through substance ([[Hegelian]] truth), rather than [[substance theory|substances]] as fixed concepts or "things" ([[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] truth). Since Whitehead, process thought is distinguished from [[Hegel]] in that it describes entities that arise or coalesce in ''becoming'', rather than being simply dialectically determined from prior posited determinates. These entities are referred to as ''complexes of occasions of experience''. It is also distinguished in being not necessarily conflictual or oppositional in operation. Process may be integrative, destructive or both together, allowing for aspects of interdependence, influence, and confluence, and addressing coherence in universal as well as particular developments, i.e., those aspects not befitting Hegel's system. Additionally, instances of determinate occasions of experience, while always ephemeral, are nonetheless seen as important to define the type and continuity of those occasions of experience that flow from or relate to them.

==Whitehead's ''Process and Reality''==
[[Alfred North Whitehead]] began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined [[Harvard University]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/|title= Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925), Whitehead noted that the human intuitions and experiences of science, aesthetics, ethics, and religion influence the worldview of a community, but that in the last several centuries science dominates [[Western culture]]. Whitehead sought a holistic, comprehensive [[Cosmology (philosophy)|cosmology]] that provides a systematic descriptive theory of the world which can be used for the diverse human intuitions gained through ethical, aesthetic, religious, and scientific experiences, and not just the scientific.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"/&gt;

Whitehead's influences were not restricted to philosophers or physicists or mathematicians. He was influenced by the French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), whom he credits along with [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] in the preface to ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929). ''Process and Reality'', Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process metaphysics===

For Whitehead, metaphysics is about logical frameworks for the conduct of discussions of the character of the world. It is not directly and immediately about facts of nature, but only indirectly so, in that its task is to explicitly formulate the language and conceptual presuppositions that are used to describe the facts of nature. Whitehead thinks that discovery of previously unknown facts of nature can in principle call for reconstruction of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929), pp. 13, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process metaphysics elaborated in ''[[Process and Reality]]''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; posits an ontology which is based on the two kinds of existence of an [[wikt:entity|entity]], that of actual entity and that of abstract entity or [[abstraction]], also called 'object'.&lt;ref&gt;Palter, R.M. (1960). ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Science'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Actual entity''' is a term coined by Whitehead to refer to the entities that really exist in the natural world.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"&gt;Robert Audi. 1995, ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy.'' Cambridge: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge. 851–853.&lt;/ref&gt; For Whitehead, actual entities are spatiotemporally extended events or processes.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; An actual entity is how something is happening, and how its happening is related to other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The actually existing world is a multiplicity of actual entities overlapping one another.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

The ultimate abstract principle of actual existence for Whitehead is '''creativity'''. Creativity is a term coined by Whitehead to show a power in the world that allows the presence of an actual entity, a new actual entity, and multiple actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; Creativity is the principle of novelty.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is manifest in what can be called 'singular causality'. This term may be contrasted with the term 'nomic causality'. An example of singular causation is that I woke this morning because my alarm clock rang. An example of nomic causation is that alarm clocks generally wake people in the morning. Aristotle recognizes singular causality as [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient causality]]. For Whitehead, there are many contributory singular causes for an event. A further contributory singular cause of my being awoken by my alarm clock this morning was that I was lying asleep near it till it rang.

An actual entity is a general philosophical term for an utterly determinate and completely concrete individual particular of the actually existing world or universe of [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#IX: Theta|changeable entities]] considered in terms of singular causality, about which categorical statements can be made. Whitehead's most far-reaching and radical contribution to metaphysics is his invention of a better way of choosing the actual entities. Whitehead chooses a way of defining the actual entities that makes them all alike, ''qua'' actual entities, with a single exception.

For example, for [[Aristotle]], the actual entities were the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#Summary#Zeta|substance]]s, such as Socrates. Besides Aristotle's ontology of substances, another example of an ontology that posits actual entities is in the [[Monadology|monads]] of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], which are said to be 'windowless'.

====Whitehead's actual entities====

For Whitehead's ontology of processes as defining the world, the actual entities exist as the only fundamental elements of reality.

The actual entities are of two kinds, temporal and atemporal.

With one exception, all actual entities for Whitehead are '''temporal''' and are '''[[wiktionary:actual occasions|occasions of experience]]''' (which are not to be confused with [[consciousness]]). An entity that people commonly think of as a simple concrete [[object (philosophy)|object]], or that Aristotle would think of as a substance, is, in this ontology, considered to be a temporally serial composite of indefinitely many overlapping occasions of experience. A human being is thus composed of indefinitely many occasions of experience.

The one exceptional actual entity is at once both temporal and '''atemporal''': God. He is objectively immortal, as well as being immanent in the world. He is objectified in each temporal actual entity; but He is not an eternal object.

The occasions of experience are of four grades. The first grade comprises processes in a physical vacuum such as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave or gravitational influence across empty space. The occasions of experience of the second grade involve just inanimate matter; "matter" being the composite overlapping of occasions of experience from the previous grade. The occasions of experience of the third grade involve living organisms. Occasions of experience of the fourth grade involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy, which means more or less what are often called the [[qualia]] of subjective experience. So far as we know, experience in the mode of presentational immediacy occurs in only more evolved animals. That some occasions of experience involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy is the one and only reason why Whitehead makes the occasions of experience his actual entities; for the actual entities must be of the ultimately general kind. Consequently, it is inessential that an occasion of experience have an aspect in the mode of presentational immediacy; occasions of the grades one, two, and three, lack that aspect.

There is no [[Mind-body dualism|mind-matter duality]] in this ontology, because "mind" is simply seen as an abstraction from an occasion of experience which has also a material aspect, which is of course simply another abstraction from it; thus the mental aspect and the material aspect are abstractions from one and the same concrete occasion of experience. The brain is part of the body, both being abstractions of a kind known as ''persistent physical objects'', neither being actual entities. Though not recognized by Aristotle, there is biological evidence, written about by [[Galen]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, R. E. (1973). ''Galen: On Psychology, Psychopathology, and Function and Diseases of the Nervous System. An Analysis of his Doctrines, Observations, and Experiments'', Karger, Basel, {{ISBN|978-3-8055-1479-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the human brain is an essential seat of human experience in the mode of presentational immediacy. We may say that the brain has a material and a mental aspect, all three being abstractions from their indefinitely many constitutive occasions of experience, which are actual entities.

===== Time, causality, and process =====

Inherent in each actual entity is its respective dimension of time. Potentially, each Whiteheadean occasion of experience is causally consequential on every other occasion of experience that precedes it in time, and has as its causal consequences every other occasion of experience that follows it in time; thus it has been said that Whitehead's occasions of experience are 'all window', in contrast to Leibniz's 'windowless' monads. In time defined relative to it, each occasion of experience is causally influenced by prior occasions of experiences, and causally influences future occasions of experience. An occasion of experience consists of a process of prehending other occasions of experience, reacting to them. This is the process in process philosophy.

Such process is never deterministic as the same [[uncertainty]] which transcends determinism through the nature of logical [[propositions]] themselves which are needed to arrive at determinism through [[scientific]] [[falsifiability]] in the first place is also intrinsic to the alienation of an other through the past which defines the will of the present which is alienated from the future. As the present causes the future the future is ruled by that same alienation or uncertainty that defines the present; but since alienation is defined by uncertainty the future is ruled by the mutual unkown as one will, thus the future is ruled by the [[dialectical monism|universal alienating]] nature of togetherness with an other as one will for the other the present's will for the future created by its alienation from the past making a [[free will]] that transcends [[being]] and [[nothingness]] through uncertainty as one [[becoming]]. Free will emerges from the unknown that drives the present to the future in a process of ever [[entropy|escelating uncertainty]] creating curiosity, creating creation itself through the [[propositional]] power of the unknown that a subject is aware of. 

Precisely because causality is uncertain, causality is created through curiosity meaning causality will also exists and causal outcomes obey the usual well-respected rule that the causes precede the effects in time. Some pairs of processes cannot be connected by cause-and-effect relations, and they are said to be [[Spacetime#Basic concepts#Space-like interval|spatially separated]]. This is in perfect agreement with the viewpoint of the Einstein theory of [[special relativity]] and with the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski geometry]] of spacetime.&lt;ref name="Naber"&gt;Naber, G. L. (1992). ''The Geometry of Minkowski Spacetime. An Introduction to the Mathematics of the Special Theory of Relativity'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-387-97848-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Whitehead respected these ideas, as may be seen for example in his 1919 book ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1919"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1919). ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''[[Process and Reality]]''. Time in this view is relative to an inertial reference frame, different reference frames defining different versions of time.

=====Atomicity=====

The actual entities, the occasions of experience, are logically '''atomic''' in the sense that an occasion of experience cannot be cut and separated into two other occasions of experience. This kind of logical atomicity is perfectly compatible with indefinitely many spatio-temporal overlaps of occasions of experience. One can explain this kind of atomicity by saying that an occasion of experience has an internal causal structure that could not be reproduced in each of the two complementary sections into which it might be cut. Nevertheless, an actual entity can completely contain each of indefinitely many other actual entities.

Another aspect of the atomicity of occasions of experience is that they do not change. An actual entity is what it is. An occasion of experience can be described as a process of change, but it is itself unchangeable.

The reader should bear in mind that the atomicity of the actual entities is of a simply logical or philosophical kind, thoroughly different in concept from the natural kind of atomicity that describes the [[atom]]s of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].

=====Topology=====

Whitehead's theory of extension was concerned with the spatio-temporal features of his occasions of experience. Fundamental to both Newtonian and to quantum theoretical mechanics is the concept of momentum. The measurement of a momentum requires a finite spatiotemporal extent. Because it has no finite spatiotemporal extent, a single point of Minkowski space cannot be an occasion of experience, but is an abstraction from an infinite set of overlapping or contained occasions of experience, as explained in ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; Though the occasions of experience are atomic, they are not necessarily separate in extension, spatiotemporally, from one another. Indefinitely many occasions of experience can '''overlap''' in Minkowski space.

Nexus is a term coined by Whitehead to show the network actual entity from universe. In the universe of actual entities spread&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; actual entity. Actual entities are clashing with each other and form other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The birth of an actual entity based on an actual entity, actual entities around him referred to as nexus.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;

An example of a nexus of temporally overlapping occasions of experience is what Whitehead calls an '''enduring physical object''', which corresponds closely with an Aristotelian substance. An enduring physical object has a temporally earliest and a temporally last member. Every member (apart from the earliest) of such a nexus is a causal consequence of the earliest member of the nexus, and every member (apart from the last) of such a nexus is a causal antecedent of the last member of the nexus. There are indefinitely many other causal antecedents and consequences of the enduring physical object, which overlap, but are not members, of the nexus. No member of the nexus is spatially separate from any other member. Within the nexus are indefinitely many continuous streams of overlapping nexūs, each stream including the earliest and the last member of the enduring physical object. Thus an enduring physical object, like an Aristotelian substance, undergoes changes and adventures during the course of its existence.

In some contexts, especially in the [[theory of relativity]] in physics, the word 'event' refers to a single point in Minkowski or in Riemannian space-time. A point event is not a process in the sense of Whitehead's metaphysics. Neither is a countable sequence or array of points. A Whiteheadian process is most importantly characterized by extension in space-time, marked by a continuum of uncountably many points in a Minkowski or a Riemannian space-time. The word 'event', indicating a Whiteheadian actual entity, is not being used in the sense of a point event.

====Whitehead's abstractions====

Whitehead's '''abstractions''' are conceptual entities that are abstracted from or derived from and founded upon his actual entities. Abstractions are themselves not actual entities. They are the only entities that can be real but are not actual entities. This statement is one form of Whitehead's 'ontological principle'.

An abstraction is a conceptual entity that refers to more than one single actual entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of actual entities as nexuses of actual entities. Collection of actual entities into a '''nexus''' emphasizes some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that some aspects of the actual entities are emphasized or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasized or left out or left behind.

'Eternal object' is a term coined by Whitehead. It is an abstraction, a possibility, or pure potential. It can be ingredient into some actual entity.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is a principle that can give a particular form to an actual entity.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004 ({{ISBN|3-937202-49-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead admitted indefinitely many eternal objects. An example of an '''eternal object''' is a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal objects are abstractions of a very high degree of abstraction. Many abstractions, including eternal objects, are potential ingredients of processes.

====Relation between actual entities and abstractions stated in the ontological principle====

For Whitehead, besides its temporal generation by the actual entities which are its contributory causes, a process may be considered as a concrescence of abstract '''ingredient''' eternal objects. God enters into every temporal actual entity.

Whitehead's '''ontological principle''' is that whatever reality pertains to an abstraction is derived from the actual entities upon which it is founded or of which it is comprised.

====Causation and concrescence of a process====
Concrescence is a term coined by Whitehead to show the process of jointly forming an actual entity that was without form, but about to manifest itself into an entity Actual full (''satisfaction'') based on datums or for information on the universe.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; The process of forming an actual entity is the case based on the existing datums. Concretion process can be regarded as ''subjectification process.''&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;John B. Cobb and David Ray Griffin. 1976, ''Process Theology, An Introduction. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Datum is a term coined by Whitehead to show the different variants of information possessed by actual entity. In process philosophy, datum is obtained through the events of concrescence. Every actual entity has a variety of datum.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

==Commentary on Whitehead and on process philosophy==
Whitehead is not an [[idealism|idealist]] in the strict sense.{{which|date=May 2013}} Whitehead's thought may be regarded as related to the idea of [[panpsychism]] (also known as panexperientialism, because of Whitehead's emphasis on experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seager|first1=William|title=Whitehead and the Revival (?) of Panpsychism|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm|website=University of Toronto Scarborough|publisher=University of Toronto at Scarborough|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On God ===
Whitehead's philosophy is very complex, subtle and nuanced and in order to comprehend his thinking regarding what is commonly referred to by many religions as "God", it is recommended that one read from ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'', wherein regarding "God" the authors elaborate Whitehead's conception.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He is the unconditioned actuality of conceptual feeling at the base of things; so that by reason of this primordial actuality, there is an order in the relevance of eternal objects to the process of creation (343 of 413) (Location 7624 of 9706 Kindle ed.)  Whitehead continues later with, "The particularities of the actual world presuppose it ; while it merely presupposes the general metaphysical character of creative advance, of which it is the primordial exemplification (344 of 413) (Location 7634 of 9706 Kindle Edition)." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Process philosophy, might be considered according to some theistic forms of religion to give a [[God#Process theology and process philosophy definition of God|God]] a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. Regarding Whitehead's use of the term, "occasions" in reference to, "God" it is explained in ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;"'Actual entities'-also termed 'actual occasions'-are the final real things of which the world is made up. There is no going behind actual entities to find anything [28] more real.  They differ among themselves: God is an actual entity, and so is the most trivial puff of existence in far-off empty space.  But, though there are gradations of importance, and diversities of function, yet in the principles which actuality exemplifies all are on the same level.  The final facts are, all alike, actual entities; and these actual entities are drops of experience, complex and interdependent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also can be assumed within some forms of theology that a God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them and this might lead to it being argued that Whitehead endorses some form of [[panentheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=John W.|title=Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|date=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids MI|isbn=978-0801049316|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aokfbkOdjuEC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=Whitehead++panentheism#v=onepage&amp;q=Whitehead%20%20panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, it is argued theologically, that "free will" is inherent to the nature of the universe, Whitehead's God is not omnipotent in Whitehead's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dombrowski|first1=Daniel A.|title=Whitehead's Religious Thought: From Mechanism to Organism, From Force to Persuasion|date=2017|publisher=State Univ of New York Pr|location=Albany|isbn=978-1438464299|pages=33–35|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ACKRDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Whitehead%27s+God+is+not+omnipotent|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God's role is to offer enhanced occasions of experience. God participates in the evolution of the universe by offering possibilities, which may be accepted or rejected. Whitehead's thinking here has given rise to [[process theology]], whose prominent advocates include [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], and [[Hans Jonas]], who was also influenced by the non-theological philosopher Martin Heidegger. However, other process philosophers have questioned Whitehead's theology, seeing it as a regressive Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hustwit|first1=J. R.|title=Process Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead enumerated three essential ''natures of God''. The ''primordial'' nature of God consists of all potentialities of existence for actual occasions, which Whitehead dubbed eternal objects. God can offer possibilities by ordering the relevance of eternal objects. The ''consequent'' nature of God prehends everything that happens in reality. As such, God experiences all of reality in a sentient manner. The last nature is the ''superjective''. This is the way in which God's synthesis becomes a sense-datum for other actual entities. In some sense, God is prehended by existing actual entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viney|first1=Donald|title=Process Theism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosoph|publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and applications ==
=== Biology ===
In [[plant morphology]], [[Rolf Sattler]] developed a process morphology (dynamic morphology) that overcomes the structure/process (or structure/function) dualism that is commonly taken for granted in biology. According to process morphology, structures such as leaves of plants do not have processes, they ''are'' processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sattler | first1 = R | year = 1990 | title = Towards a more dynamic plant morphology | url = | journal = [[Acta Biotheoretica]] | volume = 38 | issue = 3–4| pages = 303–315 | doi = 10.1007/BF00047245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sattler | first1 = R | year = 1992 | title = Process morphology: structural dynamics in development and evolution | url = | journal = [[Canadian Journal of Botany]] | volume = 70 | issue = 4| pages = 708–714 | doi = 10.1139/b92-091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolution]] and in [[Developmental biology|development]], the nature of the changes of biological objects are considered by many authors to be more radical than in physical systems. In biology, changes are not just changes of state in a pre-given space, instead the space and more generally the mathematical structures required to understand object change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montévil|first=Maël|last2=Mossio|first2=Matteo|last3=Pocheville|first3=Arnaud|last4=Longo|first4=Giuseppe|date=2016-10-01|title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation|url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches|volume=122|issue=1|pages=36–50|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005|via=|pmid=27530930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Kauffman|first3=Stuart|date=2012-01-01|title=No Entailing Laws, but Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720588|journal=Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation|series=GECCO '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=1379–1392|doi=10.1145/2330784.2330946|isbn=9781450311786|via=|arxiv=1201.2069|bibcode=2012arXiv1201.2069L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
With its perspective that everything is interconnected, that all life has value, and that non-human entities are also experiencing subjects, process philosophy has played an important role in discourse on ecology and sustainability. The first book to connect process philosophy with environmental ethics was [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]]'s 1971 work, ''Is It Too Late: A Theology of Ecology''.&lt;ref name="Is It Too Late"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |title=Is It Too Late?: A Theology of Ecology |date=1971 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |isbn=978-0028012803 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent book (2018) edited by [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]] and Wm. Andrew Schwartz, ''Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization''&lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Scwhartz |first2=Wm. Andrew |title=Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization |date=2018 |publisher=Process Century Press |location=Minnesota |isbn=978-1940447339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; contributors explicitly explore the ways in which process philosophy can be put to work to address the most urgent issues facing our world today, by contributing to a transition toward an ecological civilization. That book emerged from the largest international conference held on the theme of [[ecological civilization]] (''Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization'') which was organized by the Center for Process Studies in June 2015. The conference brought together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featured such leaders in the environmental movement as [[Bill McKibben]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Sheri Liao]].&lt;ref name="conferencereport"&gt;Herman Greene, [http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ "Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference"], last modified 24 August 2015, ''Center for Ecozoic Societies'', accessed 1 November 2016. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002603/http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ |date=4 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of [[ecological civilization]] is often affiliated with the process philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]—especially in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Zhihe |last2=Huili |first2=He |last3=Meijun |first3=Fan |title=The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/11/01/the-ecological-civilization-debate-in-china/ |website=Monthly Review |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], some of Whitehead's ideas re-emerged in combination with [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] as the [[cognitive science of mathematics]] and [[embodied mind]] theses.

Somewhat earlier, exploration of [[mathematical practice]] and [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] from the 1950s to 1980s had sought alternatives to [[metamathematics]] in social behaviours around [[mathematics]] itself: for instance, [[Paul Erdős]]'s simultaneous belief in [[Platonism]] and a single "big book" in which all proofs existed, combined with his personal obsessive need or decision to collaborate with the widest possible number of other mathematicians. The process, rather than the outcomes, seemed to drive his explicit behaviour and odd use of language, as if the synthesis of Erdős and collaborators in seeking proofs, creating sense-datum for other mathematicians, was itself the expression of a divine will. Certainly, Erdős behaved as if nothing else in the world mattered, including money or love, as emphasized in his biography ''[[The Man Who Loved Only Numbers]]''.

=== Medicine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Several fields of science and especially [[medicine]] seem {{vague|date=May 2013}} to make liberal use of ideas in process philosophy, notably the theory of [[pain]] and [[healing]] of the late 20th century. The [[Philosophy of healthcare|philosophy of medicine]] began to deviate somewhat from [[scientific method]] and an emphasis on repeatable results in the very late 20th century by embracing [[Health system|population thinking]], and a more pragmatic approach to issues in [[public health]], [[environmental health]] and especially [[mental health]]. In this latter field, [[R. D. Laing]], [[Thomas Szasz]] and [[Michel Foucault]] were instrumental in moving medicine away from emphasis on "cures" and towards concepts of individuals in balance with their society, both of which are changing, and against which no benchmarks or finished "cures" were very likely to be measurable.

=== Psychology ===
In [[psychology]], the subject of imagination was again explored more extensively since Whitehead, and the question of feasibility or "eternal objects" of thought became central to the impaired [[theory of mind]] explorations that framed postmodern [[cognitive science]]. A biological understanding of the most eternal object, that being the emerging of similar but independent cognitive apparatus, led to an obsession with the process "embodiment", that being, the emergence of these [[cognition]]s. Like Whitehead's God, especially as elaborated in [[J. J. Gibson]]'s [[perceptual psychology]] emphasizing [[affordance]]s, by ordering the relevance of eternal objects (especially the cognitions of other such actors), the world becomes. Or, it becomes simple enough for human beings to begin to make choices, and to prehend what happens as a result. These experiences may be summed in some sense but can only approximately be shared, even among very similar cognitions with identical DNA. An early explorer of this view was [[Alan Turing]] who sought to prove the limits of expressive complexity of human genes in the late 1940s, to put bounds on the complexity of human [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and so assess the feasibility of [[artificial intelligence]] emerging. Since 2000, Process Psychology has progressed as an independent academic and therapeutic discipline: In 2000, [[Michel Weber]] created the Whitehead Psychology Nexus: an open forum dedicated to the cross-examination of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and the various facets of the contemporary psychological field.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, John B., Jr. "Process Psychotherapy: Introduction". ''Process Studies'' vol. 29, no. 1 (Spring–Summer 2000): 97–102; cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy of Movement ===
The [[Philosophy of motion|philosophy of movement]] is a sub-area within process philosophy that treats processes as ''movements''. It studies processes as flows, folds, and fields in historical patterns of centripetal, centrifugal, tensional, and elastic motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Being and motion|last=Nail, Thomas|isbn=978-0-19-090890-4|location=New York, NY|oclc=1040086073|date = 10 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Thomas Nail]]'s philosophy of movement and "process materialism."&lt;br /&gt;

'''Polanyi’s paradox''', named in honour of the British-Hungarian philosopher [[Michael Polanyi]], is the theory that human knowledge of how the world functions and capability are, to a large extent, beyond our explicit understanding. The theory was articulated by Michael Polanyi in his book ''The Tacit Dimension'' in 1966, but it was economist [[David Autor]] that named it as Polanyi’s paradox in his 2014 research paper on “Polanyi’s Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Autor|first=David|title=Polanyi's Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth|url=http://www.nber.org.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/papers/w20485.pdf|pages=1–48|year=2014|series=NBER Working Paper Series|place=Cambridge, MA|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarised in the slogan "We can know more than we can tell", Polanyi’s paradox is mainly to explain the cognitive phenomenon that there exist many tasks which we, human beings, understand intuitively how to perform but cannot verbalize the rules or procedures behind it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This "self-ignorance" is common to many human activities, from driving a car in traffic to face recognition.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As Polanyi argues, humans are relying on their [[tacit knowledge]], which is difficult to adequately express by verbal means, when engaging these tasks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tacit Dimension|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=|year=May 2009|isbn=9780226672984|location=Chicago|pages=1–26|oclc=262429494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polanyi's paradox has been widely considered a major obstacle in the fields of AI and automation, since the absence of consciously accessible knowledge creates tremendous difficulty in programming.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Origins ==
British-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi regularly studied the causes behind human ability to acquire knowledge that they cannot explain through logical deduction. In his work ''The Tacit Dimension'' (1966)'','' Polanyi explored the 'tacit' dimension to human knowledge and developed the concept of "tacit knowledge", as opposed to the term "[[explicit knowledge]]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Tacit knowledge]] can be defined as knowledge people learn from experiences and internalize unconsciously, which is therefore difficult to articulate and codify it in a tangible form. Explicit knowledge, the opposite of tacit knowledge, is knowledge that can be readily verbalized and formalized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tacit knowledge is largely acquired through [[implicit learning]], the process by which information is learned independently of the subjects' awareness. For example, native speakers tacitly acquire their language in early childhood without consciously studying specific grammar rules (explicit knowledge), but with extensive exposure to day-to-day communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reber|first=Arthur|date=September 1989|title=Implicit Learning and Tacit Knowledge|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232481584|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=118|issue=3|pages=219–235|via=|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.118.3.219|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.6707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, people can only limitedly transfer their tacit knowledge through close interactions (sharing experiences with one another or observing others' behaviors). A certain level of trust needs to be established between individuals to capture tacit knowledge.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ganga Rejuvenation : Governance Challenges and Policy Options|last=Asanarong|first=Thanathorn|last2=Jeon|first2=Sowon|last3=Ren|first3=Yuanlin|last4=Yeo|first4=Christopher|date=18 December 2018|publisher=World Scientific|others=Wu Xun, Robert James Wasson, Ora-Orn Poocharoen|isbn=9789814704588|location=New Jersey|pages=349|chapter=Creating a Knowledge Management Culture for Ganga River|oclc=1013819475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacit knowledge comprises a range of conceptual and sensory information that is featured with strong personal subjectivity. It is implicitly reflected in human actions; as argued by Polanyi, "tacit knowledge dwells in our awareness".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People's skills, experiences, insight, creativity and judgement all fall into this dimension.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Chugh|first=Ritesh|title=Do Australian Universities Encourage Tacit Knowledge Transfer|url=https://www.academia.edu/19661139|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management|pages=128–135|year=2015|place=Lisbon, PT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tacit knowledge can also be described as ''know-how,'' distinguishing from ''know-that'' or ''facts.''&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Before Polanyi, Gilbert Ryle published a paper in 1945 drawing the distinction between ''knowing-that (knowledge of proposition)'' and ''knowing-how.'' According to Ryle, this ''know-how'' knowledge is the instinctive and intrinsic knowledge ingrained in the individual's human capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryle|first=Gilbert|date=1945|title=Knowing How and Knowing That: The Presidential Address|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|volume=46|pages=1–16|jstor=4544405|doi=10.1093/aristotelian/46.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since tacit knowledge cannot be stated in propositional or formal form, Polanyi concludes such inability in articulation in the slogan ‘We can know more than we can tell’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Daily activities based on tacit knowledge include recognizing a face, driving a car, riding a bike, writing a persuasive paragraph, developing a hypothesis to explain a poorly understood phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Take facial recognition as an illustration: we can recognize our acquaintance's face out of a million others while we are not conscious about the knowledge of his face. It would be difficult for us to describe the precise arrangement of his eyes, nose and mouth, since we memorize the face unconsciously.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As a prelude to ''The Tacit Dimension'', in his book ''Personal Knowledge'' (1958), Polanyi claims that all knowing is personal, emphasizing the profound effects of personal feelings and commitments on the practice of science and knowledge. Arguing against the then dominant Empiricists view that minds and experiences are reducible to sense data and collections of rules, he advocates a [[Postpositivism|post-positivist]] approach that recognizes human knowledge is often beyond their explicit expression. Any attempt to specify tacit knowing only leads to self-evident axioms that cannot tell us why we should accept them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personal Knowledge : Towards a Post-critical Philosophy|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|others=|year=1974|isbn=978-0226672885|edition=  |location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=880960082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
Polanyi's observation has deep implications in the AI field since the paradox he identified that "our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our explicit understanding" accounts for many of the challenges for computerization and automation over the past five decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Automation requires high levels of exactness to inform the computer what is supposed to be done while tacit knowledge cannot be conveyed in a propositional form. Therefore, machines cannot provide successful outcomes in many cases: they have explicit knowledge (raw data) but nevertheless, do not know how to use such knowledge to understand the task as whole.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This discrepancy between human reasoning and AI learning algorithms makes it difficult to automate tasks that demand common sense, flexibility, adaptability and judgment — human intuitive knowledge.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Android Dreams: the Past, Present and Future of Artificial Intelligence|last=Walsh|first=Toby|publisher=C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd|date=September 7, 2017|isbn=9781849048712|location=London|pages=89–97|oclc=985805795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT economist David Autor is one of the leading sceptics who doubt the prospects for machine intelligence. Despite the exponential growth in computational resources and the relentless pace of automation since the 1990s, Autor argues, Polanyi's paradox impedes modern algorithms to replace human labor in a range of skilled jobs. The extent of machine substitution of human labor, therefore, has been overestimated by journalists and expert commentators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although contemporary computer science strives for prevailing over Polanyi's paradox, the ever-changing, unstructured nature of some activities currently presents intimidating challenges for automation. Despite years of time and billions of investment spent on the development of [[self-driving car]]s and cleaning robots, these machine learning systems continue to struggle with their low adaptability and interpretability, from self-driving cars' inability to make an unexpected detour to cleaning robots' vulnerability to unmonitored pets or kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humans as a Service : the Promise and Perils of Work in the Gig Economy|last=Prassl|first=Jeremias|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780198797012|edition=  |location=Oxford|pages=138–139|oclc=1005117556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, to let self-driving cars function optimally, we have to change current road infrastructure significantly, minimizing the need for human capabilities in the whole driving process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/15/5-confounding-questions-that-hold-the-key-to-the-future-of-driverless-cars/|title=5 Confounding Questions that Hold the Key to the Future of Driverless Cars|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=January 15, 2015|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing [[Job polarisation|occupational polarisation]] in the past few decades —the growth of both high-paid, high-skill abstract jobs and lower-paid, low-skill manual jobs — has been a manifestation of Polanyi's paradox. According to Autor, there are two types of tasks proven stubbornly challenging for artificial intelligence (AI): abstract tasks that require problem-solving capabilities, intuition, creativity and persuasion on the one hand, and manual tasks demanding situational adaptability, visual recognition, language understanding, and in-person interactions on the other. Abstract tasks are characteristic of professional, managerial, and technical occupations, while service and laborer occupations involve many manual tasks (e.g. cleaning, lifting and throwing). These jobs tend to be complemented by machines rather than substituted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By contrast, as the price of computing power declines, computers extensively substitute for routine tasks that can be codified into clear sets of instructions, resulting in a dramatical decline in employment of routine task-&amp;shy;intensive jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This polarization has resulted in a shrinking middle class across industrialized economies since many middle-income occupations in sales, office and administrative work and repetitive production work are task-&amp;shy;intensive. Moreover, the subsequent growth in income inequality and wealth disparity has recently emerged as a major socio-economic issue in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vardi|first=Moshe|date=February 2015|title=Is Information Technology Destroying the Middle Class?|url=https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/2/182648-is-information-technology-destroying-the-middle-class/fulltext|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=58|issue=2|pages=5|via=|doi=10.1145/2666241|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some technological optimists argue that recent advances in [[machine learning]] have overcome Polanyi's paradox. Instead of relying on programmer’s algorithms to instruct them in human knowledge, computer systems are now able to learn tacit rules from context, abundant data, and applied statistics on their own. Since machines can infer the tacit knowledge that human beings draw upon from examples without human assistance, they are no longer limited by those rules tacitly applied but not explicitly understood by humans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Susskind|first=Daniel|title=Re-Thinking the Capabilities of Machines in Economics|url=https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/15127/825-susskind-capabilities-of-machines.pdf|pages=1–14|year=2017|series=University of Oxford Department of Economics Discussion Paper Series|place=Oxford, OX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lee Sedol (B) vs AlphaGo (W) - Game 1.jpg|thumb|Lee Sedol (B) vs AlphaGo (W) - Game 1]]
[[AlphaGo]] program built by the Google subsidiary [[DeepMind]] is a great example of how advances in AI have allowed mindless machines to perform tasks based on tacit knowledge outstandingly. In the 2016 tournament of the strategy game Go, DeepMind’s AlphaGo program successfully defeated one of the world’s top GO players, [[Lee Sedol|Lee Se-dol]], four games to one. DeepMind team employed an approach known as [[deep learning]] to build human-type judgment into AI systems; therefore, they can figure out complex winning strategies by seeing vast examples of Go matches.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/opinion/where-computers-defeat-humans-and-where-they-cant.html|title=Where Computers Defeat Humans, and Where They Can’t|last=McAfee|first=Andrew|date=16 March 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-04|last2=Brynjolfsson|first2=Erik|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, as Carr argues, the assumption that computers need to be able to reproduce tacit knowledge applied by humans to perform complicated tasks is essentially doubtable. When performing demanding tasks, it is not necessary for systems and machines to reflect the rules that human beings follow at all. The requirement is to replicate our outcomes for practical purposes, rather than our means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Glass Cage: Automation and Us|last=Carr|first=Nicholas|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|date=September 29, 2014|isbn=9780393240764|edition=  First|location=New York|pages=11–12|oclc=870098283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerry Kaplan]], a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and AI expert, also illustrates this point in his book ''Humans Need Not Apply'' by discussing four resources and capabilities required to accomplish any given task: awareness, energy, reasoning and means. Humans' biological system (the brain-body complex) naturally integrates all these four properties, while in the electronic domain machines nowadays are given these abilities by accelerating developments in robotics, machine learning, and perception powering systems. For example, sensory data provided by a wide network of sensors enable AI to perceive various aspects of the environment and respond instantly in chaotic and complex real-world situations (awareness); orders and signals for actuating devices can be centralised and managed in [[Computer cluster|server clusters]] or on the 'cloud' (reasoning).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humans Need Not Apply : a Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence|last=Kaplan|first=Jerry|publisher=Yale University Press|date=August 4, 2015|isbn=9780300223576|location=New Haven|pages=41–43, 145|oclc=907143085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan's argument directly supports the proposition that Polanyi's paradox can no longer impede further levels of automation, whether in performing routine jobs or manual jobs. As Kaplan puts it, "Automation is blind to the colour of your collar."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

One example confirms Kaplan's argument is the introduction of Cloud AutoML, an automated system that could help every business design AI software, by Google Brain AI research group in 2017. The learning algorithms of AutoML automates the process of building machine-learning models that can take on a particular task, aiming to democratize AI to the largest possible community of developers and businesses. According to Google’s CEO, Cloud AutoML has taken over some of the work of programmers (which is, in the words of Autor, "abstract task") and thereby offered one solution to the shortage in machine-learning experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607894/why-googles-ceo-is-excited-about-automating-artificial-intelligence/|title=Google’s CEO is excited about seeing AI take over some work of his AI experts|last=Simonite|first=Tom|date=May 17, 2017|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-30|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==

=== Moravec's paradox ===

[[Moravec's paradox|Moravec’s paradox]] is very closed related to Polanyi's paradox, which claims that compared with sophisticated tasks demanding high-level reasoning, it is harder for computers to master low-level physical and cognitive skills that are natural and easy for humans to perform. Examples include [[natural language processing]] and dextrous physical movements (e.g. running over rough terrain).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies|last=Brynjolfsson|first=Erik|last2=McAfee|first2=Andrew|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|others=|date=January 20, 2014|isbn=9780393239355|edition=  First|location=New York|pages=47–50|oclc=867423744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robotics experts have, accordingly, found it difficult to automate the skills of even the least-trained manual worker, since these jobs require perception and mobility (tacit knowledge).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the words of the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker from his book ''[[The Language Instinct]],'' "The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=William Morrow and Company|year=1994|isbn=978-0688121419|location=New York|pages=|oclc=28723210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corresponding to David Autor's discussion on jobs polarization, Pinker maintains that the appearance of the new generation's intelligent machines would place stock analysts, petrochemical engineers and parole board members in danger of being replaced. Gardeners, receptionists, and cooks are, by contrast, currently secure.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Plato's Problem ===

[[Plato's Problem|Plato's Problem]] is the term given by Noam Chomsky to "the problem of explaining how we can know so much" given our limited experience.

=== Poverty of the stimulus (POS) ===

[[Poverty of the stimulus|Poverty of the stimulus (POS)]] is the argument from linguistics that children are not exposed to rich enough data within their linguistic environments to acquire every feature of their language.

=== Meno’s Paradox ===

[[Meno|Meno’s Paradox]] can be formulated as follows:
# If you know what you’re looking for, inquiry is unnecessary.
# If you don’t know what you’re looking for, inquiry is impossible.
# Therefore, inquiry is either unnecessary or impossible.

There is within these arguments an implicit premise that either you know what you’re looking for or you don’t know what you’re looking for.

=== The Learning Paradox ===

The Learning Paradox (Fodor 1980) holds that knowledge can either not be new, or not be learned. If new knowledge can be expressed in terms of old knowledge, it is not new. If it cannot be expressed in terms of old knowledge, it cannot be understood. Therefore, learning something genuinely novel is impossible and all essential structures must be present at birth.

'''Hellenistic philosophy''' is the period of [[Western philosophy]] and [[Middle Eastern philosophy]] that was developed in the [[Hellenistic period]] following [[Aristotle]] and ending with the beginning of [[Neoplatonism]].

==Hellenistic schools of thought==
===Pythagoreanism===
[[Pythagoreanism]] is the name given to the system of philosophy and science developed by [[Pythagoras]], which influenced nearly all the systems of Hellenistic philosophy that followed. Two schools of Pythagorean thought eventually developed; one based largely on mathematics and continuing his line of scientific work, while the other focused on his metaphysical teachings, though each shared a part of the other.
* [[Pythagoras]] of Croton (570–495 BC)
* [[Hippasus]] (5th century BC)

===Sophism===
In Ancient Greece, the [[sophist]]s were a category of teachers who specialized in using the tools of philosophy and rhetoric for the purpose of teaching [[arete]] (excellence, virtue) predominantly to young statesmen and nobility.
* [[Protagoras]] (490–420 BC)
* [[Gorgias]] (485–380 BC)
* [[Antiphon (orator)|Antiphon]] (480–411 BC)

===Cynicism===
The [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] were an ascetic sect of philosophers beginning with [[Antisthenes]] in the 4th century BC and continuing until the 5th century AD. They believed that one should live a life of [[Virtue]] in agreement with [[Nature]]. This meant rejecting all conventional desires for [[wealth]], [[power (social and political)|power]], [[health]], or [[celebrity]], and living a life free from possessions.
* [[Antisthenes]] (445–365 BC)
* [[Diogenes]] (412–323 BC)
* [[Crates of Thebes]] (365–285 BC)
* [[Menippus]] (c. 275 BC)
* [[Demetrius the Cynic|Demetrius]] (10–80 AD)

===Cyrenaicism===
The [[Cyrenaics]] were a [[hedonism|hedonist]] school of philosophy founded in the fourth century BC by [[Aristippus]], who was a student of [[Socrates]]. They held that pleasure was the supreme good, especially immediate gratifications; and that people could only know their own experiences, beyond that truth was unknowable. 

* [[Aristippus]] (435–360 BC)
* [[Anniceris]] (flourished 300 BC)
* [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] (flourished 290 BC)
* [[Theodorus the Atheist | Theodorus]] (c. 340 – c. 250 BC)

===Platonism===
[[Platonism]] is the name given to the philosophy of [[Plato]], which was maintained and developed by his followers. The central concept was the [[theory of forms]]: the transcendent, perfect archetypes, of which objects in the everyday world are imperfect copies. The highest form was the [[Form of the Good]], the source of being, which could be known by [[reason]]. In the 3rd century BC, [[Arcesilaus]] adopted [[Academic skepticism]], which became a central tenet of the school until 90 BC when [[Antiochus of Ascalon|Antiochus]] added [[Stoicism|Stoic]] elements, rejecting skepticism. With the adoption of oriental [[mysticism]] in the third century AD, Platonism evolved into [[Neoplatonism]].
* [[Speusippus]] (407–339 BC)
* [[Xenocrates]] (396–314 BC)
* [[Antiochus of Ascalon]] (130–68 BC)
* [[Plutarch]] (46–120 AD)

===Peripateticism===
The [[Peripatetic school]] was the name given to the philosophers who maintained and developed the philosophy of [[Aristotle]]. They advocated examination of the world to understand the ultimate foundation of things. The goal of life was the [[happiness]] which originated from [[virtue|virtuous]] actions, which consisted in keeping the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|mean]] between the two extremes of the too much and the too little.
* [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC)
* [[Theophrastus]] (371–287 BC)
* [[Strato of Lampsacus]] (335–269 BC)
* [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (c. 200 AD)

===Pyrrhonism===
[[Pyrrhonism]] is a school of [[philosophical skepticism]] that originated with [[Pyrrho]] in the 3rd century BC, and was further advanced by [[Aenesidemus]] in the 1st century BC. Its objective is [[ataraxia]] (being mentally unperturbed), which is achieved through [[epoché]] (i.e. [[suspension of judgment]]) about non-evident matters (i.e., matters of [[belief]]). 
* [[Pyrrho]] (365–275 BC)
* [[Timon of Phlius]] (320–230 BC)
* [[Aenesidemus]] (1st century BC)
* [[Sextus Empiricus]] (2nd century AD)

===Epicureanism===
[[Epicureanism]] was founded by Epicurus in the 3rd century BC. It viewed the [[universe]] as being ruled by [[chance (philosophy)|chance]], with no interference from [[gods]]. It regarded absence of pain as the greatest pleasure, and advocated a simple life. It was the main rival to [[Stoicism]] until both philosophies died out in the 3rd century AD.
* [[Epicurus]] (341–270 BC)
* [[Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger)|Metrodorus]] (331–278 BC)
* [[Hermarchus]] (325-250 BC)
* [[Zeno of Sidon]] (1st century BC)
* [[Philodemus]] (110–40 BC)
* [[Lucretius]] (99–55 BC)

===Stoicism===
[[Image:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zeno of Citium]] (333–263 BC), the founder of [[Stoicism]]]]
[[Stoicism]] was founded by [[Zeno of Citium]] in the 3rd century BC. Based on the ethical ideas of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], it taught that the goal of life was to live in accordance with [[Nature]]. It advocated the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive [[emotions]]. 
* [[Zeno of Citium]] (333–263 BC)
* [[Cleanthes]] (331–232 BC)
* [[Chrysippus]] (280–207 BC)
* [[Panaetius]] (185–110 BC)
* [[Posidonius]] (135–51 BC)
* [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (4 BC – 65 AD)
* [[Epictetus]] (55–135 AD)
* [[Marcus Aurelius]] (121–180 AD)

===Academic Skepticism===
[[Academic skepticism]] is the period of ancient [[Platonism]] dating from around 266 BC, when [[Arcesilaus]] became head of the [[Platonic Academy]], until around 90 BC, when [[Antiochus of Ascalon]] rejected skepticism, although individual philosophers, such as [[Favorinus]] and his teacher [[Plutarch]] continued to defend Academic skepticism after this date. The Academic skeptics maintained that knowledge of things is impossible. Ideas or notions are never true; nevertheless, there are degrees of truth-likeness, and hence degrees of belief, which allow one to act. The school was characterized by its attacks on the [[Stoics]] and on the Stoic [[dogma]] that [[Katalepsis|convincing impressions]] led to true [[episteme|knowledge]]. 
* [[Arcesilaus]] (316–232 BC)
* [[Carneades]] (214–129 BC)
* [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC)

===Eclecticism===
[[Eclecticism]] was a system of philosophy which adopted no single set of doctrines but selected from existing philosophical beliefs those doctrines that seemed most reasonable. Its most notable advocate was [[Cicero]].
* [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro Reatinus]] (116–27 BC)
* [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC)
* [[Seneca the Younger]] (4 BC – 65 AD)

===Hellenistic Judaism===
[[Hellenistic Judaism]] was an attempt to establish the [[Jewish]] religious tradition within the culture and language of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]]. Its principal representative was Philo of Alexandria.
* [[Philo of Alexandria]] (30 BC – 45 AD)
* [[Josephus]] (37–100 AD)

===Neopythagoreanism===
[[Neopythagoreanism]] was a school of philosophy reviving [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrines, which was prominent in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. It was an attempt to introduce a [[religious]] element into Greek philosophy, worshipping God by living an [[ascetic]] life, ignoring bodily pleasures and all sensuous impulses, to purify the [[soul]].
* [[Nigidius Figulus]] (98–45 BC)
* [[Apollonius of Tyana]] (15/40–100/120 AD)
* [[Numenius of Apamea]] (2nd century AD)

===Hellenistic Christianity===
[[Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity|Hellenistic Christianity]] was the attempt to reconcile [[Christianity]] with Greek philosophy, beginning in the late 2nd century. Drawing particularly on [[Platonism]] and the newly emerging Neoplatonism, figures such as [[Clement of Alexandria]] sought to provide Christianity with a philosophical framework.
* [[Clement of Alexandria]] (150–215 AD)
* [[Origen]] (185–254 AD)
* [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 AD)
* [[Aelia Eudocia]] (401–460 AD)

===Neoplatonism===
[[Neoplatonism]], or ''Plotinism'', is a school of religious and mystical philosophy founded by [[Plotinus]] in the 3rd century AD and based on the teachings of Plato and the other Platonists. The summit of existence was [[Absolute (philosophy)|the One]] or the Good, the source of all things. In [[virtue]] and [[meditation]] the soul had the power to elevate itself to attain union with the One, the true function of human beings. Non-Christian Neoplatonists used to attack Christianity until Christians such as [[Augustine]], [[Boethius]], and [[Eriugena]] adopt Neoplatonism.  
* [[Plotinus]] (205–270 AD)
* [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (233–309 AD)
* [[Iamblichus of Chalcis]] (245–325 AD)
* [[Proclus]] (412–485 AD)

'''''Les Chemins de la philosophie''''' (the ways of philosophy) (previously entitled '''''Les Nouveaux Chemins de la connaissance''''' (The new ways of knowledge) until 2017) is a French philosophy radio program broadcast daily on [[France Culture]] and presented by [[Adèle Van Reeth]]. In 2017, the show is the most [[Podcasting|podcast]] of the radio station.

== History ==
The program, first called ''Les chemins de la connaissance'', then renamed ''Les Nouveaux Chemins de la connaissance'', was hosted by [[Raphaël Enthoven]] from 2007 to 2011. Van Reeth, collaborator and columnist on the show, succeeded him. At the beginning of 2017, she renamed the program ''Les Chemins de la philosophie'', fully assuming the philosophical character of the program.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|language=fr|author1=Antoine Flandrin|title=Adèle Van Reeth, la voix de la philo à la radio|journal=[[Le Monde]]|date=27 May 2017|url=http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/televisions-radio/article/2017/05/27/adele-van-reeth-la-voix-de-la-philo-a-la-radio_5134585_1655027.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most downloaded show on France Culture (two million downloads per month, on average, in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) 

According to van Reeth, the success of the program is due to its transversal approach and the abandonment of the teaching tone, often criticized against France Culture,&lt;ref name="podcast"&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/ecrans/2013/09/23/podcast-france-culture-cartonne-au-rattrapage_934101 ''Podcast : France Culture cartonne au rattrapage'']&lt;/ref&gt; without giving in to a certain intellectual slackness: "Pedagogy implies setting a threshold of requirement while trying to say things that seem complicated clearly," she reports to the newspaper ''[[Libération]]''.&lt;ref name="podcast"/&gt;

{{Certainty}}
The distinction between '''[[wikt:absolute|absolute]]''' and '''[[wikt:Special:Search/relative|relative]]''' terms was introduced by [[Peter Unger]] in his 1971 paper ''A Defense of Skepticism'' and differentiates between terms that, in their most [[wikt:literal|literal]] sense, don't admit of degrees (absolute terms) and those that do (relative terms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Defense of Skepticism|first1=Peter|last1=Unger|date=April 1971|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=80|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his account, the term "flat", for example, is an absolute term because a surface is either perfectly (or absolutely) flat or isn't flat at all. The terms "bumpy" or "curved", on the other hand, are relative terms because there is no such thing as "absolute bumpiness" or "absolute curvedness". A bumpy surface can always be made bumpier. A truly flat surface, however, can never be made flatter. [[Colloquially]], he acknowledges, we do say things like "surface A is flatter than surface B", but this is just a shorter way of saying "surface A is closer to being flat than surface B". This [[paraphrasing]], however, doesn't work for relative terms. Another important aspect of absolute terms, one that motivated this choice of [[terminology]], is that they can always be [[wikt:modified|modified]] by the term "absolutely". For example, it is quite natural to say "this surface is absolutely flat", but it would be very strange and barely even meaningful to say "this surface is absolutely bumpy".

==The applicability absolute terms==
Once the distinction is made, it becomes apparent that the application of absolute terms to describe the real-world objects is doubtful. Absolute terms describe properties that are ideal in a [[Platonic idealism|Platonic]] sense, but that are not present any concrete, real-world object.
{{Quote
|text=For example, while we say of many surfaces of physical things that they are flat, a rather reasonable [[wikt:interpretation|interpretation]] of what we presumably observe makes it quite doubtful that these surfaces actually ''are'' flat. When we look at a rather smooth block of stone through a powerful microscope, the observed surface appears to be rife with irregularities. And this irregular appearance seems best explained, not by its being taken as an illusory [[optical phenomenon]] but, by our taking it to be a finer, more revealing look of a surface which is, in fact, rife with smallish bumps and crevices. Further, we account for bumps and crevices by supposing that the stone is composed of much smaller things, [[molecules]] and so on, which are in such a combination that, while a large and sturdy stone is the upshot, no stone with a flat surface is found to obtain.
|author=Peter Unger
|title="A Defense of Skepticism"
}}

==Certainty and knowledge==

The distinction sets up the foundation for the final [[argument]] of the paper: that [[knowledge]] requires certainty and that, certainty being an absolute term, it follows that it can never be achieved in reality. It is a Platonic ideal that we can get closer and closer to, but never truly reach. In Unger's own words, "every human being knows, at best, hardly anything to be so".

{{More citations needed|date=August 2010}}
'''Moral rationalism''', also called '''ethical rationalism''', is a view in [[meta-ethics]] (specifically the [[epistemology]] of [[ethics]]) according to which moral principles are knowable ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', by reason alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethical rationalism and the law|others=Capps, Patrick,, Pattinson, Shaun D.|isbn=9781849467865|location=Oxford|oclc=919107782|date = 2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent figures in the [[history of philosophy]] who have defended moral rationalism are [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Perhaps the most prominent figure in the history of philosophy who has rejected moral rationalism is [[David Hume]]. Recent philosophers who have defended moral rationalism include [[R. M. Hare|Richard Hare]], [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Alan Gewirth]], and [[Michael A. Smith (philosopher)|Michael Smith]].

Moral rationalism is similar to the rationalist version of [[ethical intuitionism]]; however, they are distinct views. Moral rationalism is neutral on whether basic moral beliefs are known via inference or not. A moral rationalist who believes that some moral beliefs are justified non-inferentially is a [[Ethical intuitionism#Rational intuition versus moral sense|rationalist ethical intuitionist]]. So, rationalist ethical intuitionism implies moral rationalism, but the reverse does not hold.

==Emotions and reason==

There are two main forms of moral rationalism, associated with two major forms of reasoning.  If moral reasoning is based on [[theoretical reason]], and is hence analogous to discovering [[empirical]] or [[scientific]] [[truth]]s about the world, a purely emotionless being could arrive at the truths of reason.  Such a being wouldn't necessarily be motivated to act morally.  Beings who are motivated to act morally can also arrive at moral truths, but needn't rely upon their emotions to do so.

Many moral rationalists believe that moral reasoning is based on [[practical reason]], which involves choices about what to do or intend to do, including how to achieve one's goals and what goals one should have in the first place.  In this view, moral reasoning always involves emotional states and hence is intrinsically motivating.  Immanuel Kant expressed this view when he said that immoral actions do not involve a contradiction in belief, but a contradiction in the will, that is, in one's commitment to a principle which one intends to motivate actions. Christine Korsgaard's elaboration of Kantian reasoning tries to show that if ethics is actually based on practical reasoning, this shows that it can be objective and universal, without having to appeal to questionable metaphysical assumptions.

==Criticisms==
[[Moral sense theory|Moral sense theorists]] (or sentimentalists), such as [[David Hume]], are the key opponents of moral rationalism. In Book 3 of ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' and in ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (EPM), Hume argues (among other things) that reason and emotions (or the "passions" as he often calls them) are quite distinct faculties and that the foundations of morality lie in sentiment, not reason. Hume takes it as a fact about human psychology and morality that moral judgments have an essentially emotional, sentimental, or otherwise non-rational or cognitive character to them. According to Hume, "...morality is determined by sentiment. It defines virtue to be whatever mental action or quality gives to a spectator the pleasing sentiment of approbation; and vice the contrary" (EPM, Appendix 1, ¶10).

The Enlightenment emerged out of a European intellectual and scholarly movement known as [[Renaissance humanism]]. Some consider the publication of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687 as the first major enlightenment work. French historians traditionally date the Enlightenment from 1715 to 1789, from the death of [[Louis XIV of France]] until the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] that ended the [[Ancien Regime]]. Most end it with the beginning  of the 19th century. Philosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at [[Academy|scientific academies]], [[Masonic lodge]]s, [[salon (gathering)|literary salons]], [[coffeehouse]]s and in [[book|printed books]], [[Academic journal|journals]], and [[pamphlet]]s. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the Church and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including [[liberalism]] and [[neoclassicism]], trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, ''Movements, Currents, Trends: Aspects of European Thought in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on the [[sovereignty]] of [[reason]] and [[Empiricism|the evidence of the senses]] as the primary sources of [[knowledge]] and advanced ideals such as [[liberty]], [[progress]], [[toleration]], [[Fraternity (philosophy)|fraternity]],  [[constitution|constitutional government]] and [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Outram|first=Dorinda|title=Panorama of the Enlightenment|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2006|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A84nA7Ae3t0C&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Panorama%20of%20the%20Enlightenment%22&amp;pg=PA29|isbn=978-0892368617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Milan|last=Zafirovski|title=The Enlightenment and Its Effects on Modern Society|year=2010|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the central doctrines of the Enlightenment philosophers were [[individual liberty]] and [[religious tolerance]], in opposition to an [[absolute monarchy]] and the fixed dogmas of the [[Catholic Church]]. The Enlightenment was marked by an emphasis on the [[scientific method]] and [[reductionism]], along with increased questioning of religious orthodoxy—an attitude captured by [[Immanuel Kant]]'s essay [[Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?|''Answering the Question:'' ''What is Enlightenment'']]'','' where the phrase ''[[Sapere aude]]'' (Dare to know) can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Gay, Peter|title=The Enlightenment: An Interpretation|publisher=W.W.

The Age of Enlightenment was preceded by and closely associated with the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Bernard Cohen, "Scientific Revolution and Creativity in the Enlightenment." ''Eighteenth-Century Life'' 7.2 (1982): 41–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier philosophers whose work influenced the Enlightenment included [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sootin, Harry. ''Isaac Newton''. New York: Messner (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; The major figures of the Enlightenment included [[Cesare Beccaria|Beccaria]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]]. Some European rulers, including [[Catherine II of Russia]], [[Joseph II of Austria]] and [[Frederick II of Prussia]], tried to apply Enlightenment thought on religious and political tolerance, which became known as [[enlightened absolutism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, "Ancien Regime and Enlightenment. Some Recent Writing on Seventeenth-and Eighteenth-Century Europe," ''European History Quarterly'' 22.2 (1992): 247–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the main political and intellectual figures behind the [[American Revolution]] associated themselves closely with the Enlightenment: [[Benjamin Franklin]] visited Europe repeatedly and contributed actively to the scientific and political debates there and brought the newest ideas back to Philadelphia; [[Thomas Jefferson]] closely followed European ideas and later incorporated some of the ideals of the Enlightenment into the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]; and [[James Madison]] incorporated these ideals into the [[United States Constitution]] during its framing in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Ferguson, ''The American Enlightenment, 1750–1820'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential publication of the Enlightenment was the ''{{lang|fr|[[Encyclopédie]]}}'' (''Encyclopaedia''). Published between 1751 and 1772 in thirty-five volumes, it was compiled by Diderot, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] (until 1759) and a team of 150 scientists and philosophers. It helped spread the ideas of the Enlightenment across Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Darnton, ''The Business of Enlightenment: a publishing history of the Encyclopédie, 1775–1800'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Other landmark publications were Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' (''Philosophical Dictionary''; 1764) and ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733); Rousseau's ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' (1754) and ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762); Adam Smith's ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759) and ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776); and Montesquieu's ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748). The ideas of the Enlightenment played a major role in inspiring the [[French Revolution]], which began in 1789. After the Revolution, the Enlightenment was followed by the intellectual movement known as [[Romanticism]].

==Philosophy==
[[René Descartes]]' [[rationalist]] philosophy laid the foundation for enlightenment thinking. His attempt to construct the sciences on a secure [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] foundation was not as successful as his [[Cartesian doubt|method of doubt]] applied in philosophic areas leading to a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic doctrine]] of mind and matter. His [[skepticism]] was refined by [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) and [[David Hume]]'s writings in the 1740s. His dualism was challenged by [[Spinoza]]'s uncompromising assertion of the unity of matter in his [[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus|''Tractatus'']] (1670) and [[Ethics (Spinoza)|''Ethics'']] (1677).

According to [[Jonathan Israel]], these laid down two distinct lines of Enlightenment thought: first, the moderate variety, following Descartes, Locke and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], which sought accommodation between reform and the traditional systems of power and faith, and second, the radical enlightenment, inspired by the philosophy of [[Spinoza]], advocating democracy, individual liberty, freedom of expression and eradication of religious authority.{{sfn|Israel|2006|p=15}}{{sfn|Israel|2010|pp=vii–viii, 19}} The moderate variety tended to be [[deistic]], whereas the radical tendency separated the basis of morality entirely from theology. Both lines of thought were eventually opposed by a conservative [[Counter-Enlightenment]], which sought a return to faith.{{sfn|Israel|2010|p=11}}

[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]

In the mid-18th century, Paris became the center of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity challenging traditional doctrines and dogmas. The philosophical movement was led by [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argued for a society based upon reason as in ancient Greece&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history |title = Enlightenment - Definition, History, &amp; Facts |website = Encyclopedia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than faith and Catholic doctrine, for a new civil order based on natural law, and for science based on experiments and observation. The political philosopher [[Montesquieu]] introduced the idea of a [[separation of powers]] in a government, a concept which was enthusiastically adopted by the authors of the United States Constitution. While the ''Philosophes'' of the French Enlightenment were not revolutionaries and many were members of the nobility, their ideas played an important part in undermining the legitimacy of the Old Regime and shaping the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Petitfils|2005|pages=99–105}}

[[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], a moral philosopher, described the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] and [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, "the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers". Much of what is incorporated in the [[scientific method]] (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his protégés [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref name="Denby"&gt;{{Citation|title=The Scottish enlightenment and the challenges for Europe in the 21st century; climate change and energy|journal=The New Yorker|date=11 October 2004|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/11/041011crat_atlarge|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606141619/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/11/041011crat_atlarge|archivedate=6 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume became a major figure in the [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical philosophical]] and [[empiricist]] traditions of philosophy.

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) tried to reconcile [[rationalism]] and religious belief, [[individual freedom]] and political authority, as well as map out a view of the public sphere through private and public reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/KantOnElightenment.htm|title=Kant's essay What is Enlightenment?|work=mnstate.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's work continued to shape German thought and indeed all of European philosophy, well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Kuehn, ''Kant: A Biography'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was one of England's earliest [[feminist]] philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreis |first=Steven |url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/wollstonecraft.html |title=Mary Wollstonecraft, 1759–1797 |publisher=Historyguide.org |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2014-01-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111055540/http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/wollstonecraft.html |archivedate=2014-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued for a society based on reason and that women as well as men should be treated as rational beings. She is best known for her work ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1791).&lt;ref&gt;Mary Wollstonecraft, ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' (Renascence Editions, 2000) [https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/785/vindication.pdf?sequence=1 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
{{Main|Science in the Age of Enlightenment}}

Science played an important role in Enlightenment discourse and thought. Many Enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought. Scientific progress during the Enlightenment included the discovery of [[carbon dioxide]] (fixed air) by the chemist [[Joseph Black]], the argument for [[deep time]] by the geologist [[James Hutton]] and the invention of the [[Watt steam engine|condensing steam engine]] by [[James Watt]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce P. Lenman, ''Integration and Enlightenment: Scotland, 1746–1832'' (1993)  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0748603859 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments of Lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in Paris and the experiments of the [[Montgolfier Brothers]] enabled them to launch the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783 from the [[Château de la Muette]], near the [[Bois de Boulogne]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued [[empiricism]] and rational thought and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. The study of science, under the heading of [[natural philosophy]], was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and [[natural history]], which included [[anatomy]], biology, [[geology]], [[mineralogy]] and [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter (2003), 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally: Rousseau criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier.&lt;ref&gt;Burns (2003), entry: 7,103.&lt;/ref&gt; Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and [[Academy|academies]], which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the [[popular culture|popularization]] of science among an increasingly literate population. [[Philosophe]]s introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' and the popularization of [[Newtonianism]] by [[Voltaire]] and Émilie du Châtelet. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the [[history of science]].&lt;ref&gt;see Hall (1954), iii; Mason (1956), 223.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]; the development of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; a new understanding of [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]]; and the maturation of [[chemistry]] as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.

Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, (1980), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities, but contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge while societies functioned to create knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;James E. McClellan III, "Learned Societies," in ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'', ed. Alan Charles Kors (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003) {{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/Modern/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195104301 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330082517/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/Modern/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195104301 |archivedate=2012-03-30 }} (accessed on June 8, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members and the administration of the society.&lt;ref&gt;See Gillispie, (1980), "Conclusion."&lt;/ref&gt; After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, [[Bernard de Fontenelle]] coined the term "the Age of Academies" to describe the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of science also began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature during the Enlightenment. Some poetry became infused with [[scientific metaphor]] and imagery, while other poems were written directly about scientific topics. [[Sir Richard Blackmore]] committed the Newtonian system to verse in ''Creation, a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books'' (1712). After Newton's death in 1727, poems were composed in his honour for decades.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 158"&gt;Burns, (2003), entry: 158.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] (1700–1748) penned his "Poem to the Memory of Newton", which mourned the loss of Newton, but also praised his science and legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, (1786), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, Adam Smith published ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', often considered the first work on modern economics as it had an immediate impact on British economic policy that continues into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Fry"&gt;M. Fry, ''Adam Smith's Legacy: His Place in the Development of Modern Economics'' (Routledge, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; It was immediately preceded and influenced by [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]] drafts of ''[[Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth]]'' (Paris, 1766). Smith acknowledged indebtedness and possibly was the original English translator.&lt;ref&gt;The Illusion of Free Markets, Bernard E. Harcourt, p. 260, notes 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cesare Beccaria]], a jurist, criminologist, philosopher and politician and one of the great Enlightenment writers, became famous for his masterpiece ''Of Crimes and Punishments'' (1764), later translated into 22 languages,&lt;ref name="history-world.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm |title=The Enlightenment throughout Europe |publisher=History-world.org |accessdate=2013-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082708/http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm |archive-date=2013-01-23 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; which condemned torture and the death penalty and was a founding work in the field of penology and the Classical School of criminology by promoting criminal justice. Another prominent intellectual was [[Francesco Mario Pagano]], who wrote important studies such as ''Saggi Politici'' (Political Essays, 1783), one of the major works of the Enlightenment in Naples; and ''Considerazioni sul processo criminale'' (Considerations on the criminal trial, 1787), which established him as an international authority on criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Sarti, ''Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The Enlightenment has long been hailed as the foundation of modern Western political and intellectual culture.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Brewer, ''The Enlightenment Past: reconstructing eighteenth-century French thought'' (2008), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Enlightenment brought political modernization to the West, in terms of introducing democratic values and institutions and the creation of modern, liberal democracies. This thesis has been widely accepted by Anglophone scholars and has been reinforced by the large-scale studies by [[Robert Darnton]], [[Roy Porter]] and most recently by Jonathan Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Dijn | first1 = Annelien | year = 2012 | title = The Politics of Enlightenment: From Peter Gay to Jonathan Israel | url = | journal = Historical Journal | volume = 55 | issue = 3| pages = 785–805 | doi=10.1017/s0018246x12000301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|url=https://www.academia.edu/9869783|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=34–35}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of government===
[[John Locke]], one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/influence.html |title=John Locke &gt; The Influence of John Locke's Works (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |access-date=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based his governance philosophy in [[social contract theory]], a subject that permeated Enlightenment political thought. The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] ushered in this new debate with his work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' in 1651. Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European [[classical liberalism|liberal thought]]: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between [[civil society]] and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be "representative" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Manent, ''An Intellectual History of Liberalism'' (1994) pp. 20–38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rousseau.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Like other Enlightenment philosophers, [[Rousseau]] was critical of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://abolition.nypl.org/print/abolition/ The Abolition of The Slave Trade]"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Both Locke and Rousseau developed social contract theories in ''Two Treatises of Government'' and ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'', respectively. While quite different works, Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau agreed that a social contract, in which the government's authority lies in the consent of the governed,&lt;ref&gt;Lessnoff, Michael H. ''Social Contract Theory''. New York: NYU, 1990. Print.{{page?|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; is necessary for man to live in civil society. Locke defines the state of nature as a condition in which humans are rational and follow natural law, in which all men are born equal and with the right to life, liberty and property. However, when one citizen breaks the Law of Nature both the transgressor and the victim enter into a state of war, from which it is virtually impossible to break free. Therefore, Locke said that individuals enter into civil society to protect their natural rights via an "unbiased judge" or common authority, such as courts, to appeal to. Contrastingly, Rousseau's conception relies on the supposition that "civil man" is corrupted, while "natural man" has no want he cannot fulfill himself. Natural man is only taken out of the state of nature when the inequality associated with private property is established.&lt;ref&gt;Discourse on the Origin of Inequality&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau said that people join into civil society via the social contract to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom. This is embodied in the sovereignty of the [[general will]], the moral and collective legislative body constituted by citizens.

Locke is known for his statement that individuals have a right to "Life, Liberty and Property" and his belief that the natural right to property is derived from labor. Tutored by Locke, [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]] wrote in 1706: "There is a mighty Light which spreads its self over the world especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland; on whom the Affairs of Europe now turn".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first =B.|last=Rand|title=The Life, Unpublished Letters and Philosophical Regimen of Anthony, Earl of Shaftesbury|year=1900|page=353}} quoted in {{citation|first=Roy|last=Porter|title=Enlightenment, Britain and the Creation of the Modern World|publisher=Allen Lane, The Penguin Press|year=2000|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's theory of natural rights has influenced many political documents, including the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the French National Constituent Assembly's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].

The ''philosophes'' argued that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the [[market mechanism]] and [[capitalism]], the [[scientific method]], religious [[Toleration|tolerance]] and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the ''[[philosophes]]&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt;'' in particular to apply [[rationality]] to every problem is considered the essential change.&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Y. Landry, ''Marx and the postmodernism debates: an agenda for critical theory'' (2000) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much of Enlightenment political thought was dominated by social contract theorists, both David Hume and Adam Ferguson criticized this camp. Hume's essay ''Of the Original Contract'' argues that governments derived from consent are rarely seen and civil government is grounded in a ruler's habitual authority and force. It is precisely because of the ruler's authority over-and-against the subject, that the subject tacitly consents and Hume says that the subjects would "never imagine that their consent made him sovereign", rather the authority did so.&lt;ref&gt;Of the Original Contract&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Ferguson did not believe citizens built the state, rather polities grew out of social development. In his 1767 ''[[An Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'', Ferguson uses the four stages of progress, a theory that was very popular in Scotland at the time, to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without "signing" a social contract.

Both Rousseau's and Locke's social contract theories rest on the presupposition of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], which are not a result of law or custom, but are things that all men have in pre-political societies and are therefore universal and inalienable. The most famous natural right formulation comes from John Locke in his ''Second Treatise'', when he introduces the state of nature. For Locke, the law of nature is grounded on mutual security or the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights, as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights. These natural rights include perfect equality and freedom, as well as the right to preserve life and property. Locke also argued against slavery on the basis that enslaving oneself goes against the law of nature because one cannot surrender one's own rights: one's freedom is absolute and no-one can take it away. Additionally, Locke argues that one person cannot enslave another because it is morally reprehensible, although he introduces a caveat by saying that enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one's natural rights.

As a spill-over of the Enlightenment, nonsecular beliefs expressed first by Quakers and then by Protestant evangelicals in Britain and the United States emerged. To these groups, slavery became "repugnant to our religion" and a "crime in the sight of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1981|isbn=|editor-last=Eltis|editor-first=David|location=Madison|pages=76|editor-last2=Walvin|editor-first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas added to those expressed by Enlightenment thinkers, leading many in Britain to believe that slavery was "not only morally wrong and economically inefficient, but also politically unwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic Slave Trade|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2002|isbn=|editor-last=Northrup|editor-first=David|location=Boston|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these notions gained more adherents, Britain was forced to end its participation in the slave trade.

===Enlightened absolutism===
{{Main|Enlightened absolutism}}
[[File:Retrato_do_Marques_de_Pombal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], as the head of the government of Portugal, implemented sweeping socio-economic reforms (abolished [[Slavery in Portugal|slavery]], significantly weakened the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]], created the basis for secular public schools and restructured the tax system), effectively ruling as a powerful, progressive dictator]]

The leaders of the Enlightenment were not especially democratic, as they more often look to absolute monarchs as the key to imposing reforms designed by the intellectuals. Voltaire despised democracy and said the absolute monarch must be enlightened and must act as dictated by reason and justice – in other words, be a "philosopher-king".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David Williams |title=Voltaire: Political Writings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LV7GZhQEULEC&amp;pg=PR14 |year=1994 |pages=xiv–xv |isbn=978-0-521-43727-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Struensee - miniature portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Denmark's minister [[Johann Friedrich Struensee|Johann Struensee]], a social reformer, was publicly executed in 1772]]

In several nations, rulers welcomed leaders of the Enlightenment at court and asked them to help design laws and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger states. These rulers are called "enlightened despots" by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee, ''Aspects of European history, 1494–1789'' (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;258–66&lt;/ref&gt; They included [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia, [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] of Austria. Joseph was over-enthusiastic, announcing many reforms that had little support so that revolts broke out and his regime became a comedy of errors and nearly all his programs were reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Henderson, "Joseph II", ''History Today'' (March 1991) 41:21–27&lt;/ref&gt; Senior ministers [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|Pombal in Portugal]] and [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] in Denmark also governed according to Enlightenment ideals. In Poland, the model [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|constitution of 1791]] expressed Enlightenment ideals, but was in effect for only one year before [[Second Partition of Poland|the nation was partitioned]] among its neighbors. More enduring were the cultural achievements, which created a nationalist spirit in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley, "Towards A New Nation: The Enlightenment and National Revival in Poland", ''Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism'', 1983, Vol. 10 Issue 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;83–110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederick the Great]], the king of [[Prussia]] from 1740 to 1786, saw himself as a leader of the Enlightenment and patronized philosophers and scientists at his court in Berlin. Voltaire, who had been imprisoned and maltreated by the French government, was eager to accept Frederick's invitation to live at his palace. Frederick explained: "My principal occupation is to combat ignorance and prejudice&amp;nbsp;... to enlighten minds, cultivate morality, and to make people as happy as it suits human nature, and as the means at my disposal permit".&lt;ref&gt;Giles MacDonogh, ''Frederick the Great: A Life in Deed and Letters'' (2001) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolution===
The Enlightenment has been frequently linked to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. One view of the political changes that occurred during the Enlightenment is that the "[[consent of the governed]]" philosophy as delineated by Locke in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' (1689) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the "[[divine right of kings]]". In this view, the revolutions of the late 1700s and early 1800s were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully and therefore violent revolution was the result. Clearly a governance philosophy where the king was never wrong was in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government.

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] proposed the French Revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. These men of letters constituted a sort of "substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power". This illusory power came from the rise of "public opinion", born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The "literary politics" that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 8. See also Alexis de Tocqueville, ''L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution'', 1850, Book Three, Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt; De Tocqueville "clearly designates&amp;nbsp; ... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Jean-Antoine_Houdon,_Voltaire,_1778,_NGA_1266.jpg|thumb|The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] argued for [[religious tolerance]], saying that "It does not require great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that [[Christians]] should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]] my brother? The [[Qing dynasty|Chinaman]] my brother? The [[Jew|Jew]]? The [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siam]]? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?"&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire (1763) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060107013835/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/voltaire.html ''A Treatise on Toleration'']&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Enlightenment era religious commentary was a response to the preceding century of religious conflict in Europe, especially the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ed. ''The Enlightenment: Brief History with Documents'', Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2001, Introduction, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians of the Enlightenment wanted to reform their faith to its generally non-confrontational roots and to limit the capacity for religious controversy to spill over into politics and warfare while still maintaining a true faith in [[God]]. For moderate Christians, this meant a return to simple Scripture. John Locke abandoned the corpus of theological commentary in favor of an "unprejudiced examination" of the Word of God alone. He determined the essence of [[Christianity]] to be a belief in [[Christ]] the redeemer and recommended avoiding more detailed debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Locke |title=Reasonableness of Christianity |volume= "Preface" The Reasonableness of Christianity, as delivered in the Scriptures |year= 1695}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'', [[Thomas Jefferson]] went further and dropped any passages dealing with miracles, visitations of angels and the [[resurrection of Jesus]] after [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his death]], as he tried to extract the practical Christian moral code of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.B. Bernstein|title=Thomas Jefferson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vrD1WKLicwC&amp;pg=PA179|year= 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=179|isbn=978-0-19-975844-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlightenment scholars sought to curtail the political power of [[organized religion]] and thereby prevent another age of intolerant religious war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ole Peter Grell|last2=Porter|first2=Roy|title=Toleration in Enlightenment Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPTdIQBIvS0C|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=1–68|isbn=978-0-521-65196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spinoza]] determined to remove politics from contemporary and historical theology (e.g., disregarding [[Halakha|Judaic law]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Theologico-Political Treatise,'' "Preface," 1677, [http://www.gutenburg.com gutenberg.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses Mendelssohn]] advised affording no political weight to any organized religion, but instead recommended that each person follow what they found most convincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Moses |last=Mendelssohn |title=Jerusalem: Or on Religious Power and Judaism|year= 1783 |url= http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/mendelssohn1782.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed a good religion based in instinctive [[Morality|morals]] and a belief in God should not theoretically need force to maintain order in its believers, and both Mendelssohn and Spinoza judged religion on its moral fruits, not the logic of its theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goetschel|first=Willi|title=Spinoza's Modernity: Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYcOfkrduWYC&amp;pg=PA126|year=2004|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|page=126|isbn=978-0-299-19083-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including [[deism]] and talk of [[atheism]]. According to [[Thomas Paine]], deism is the simple belief in [[Creator deity|God the Creator]], with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Paine, ''Of the Religion of Deism Compared with the Christian Religion,'' 1804, Internet History Sourcebook&lt;/ref&gt; which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ellen Judy Wilson|author2=Peter Hanns Reill|title=Encyclopedia Of The Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&amp;pg=PA148|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=148|isbn=978-1-4381-1021-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note: "In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilson and Reill|title=Encyclopedia Of The Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=26|isbn=978-1-4381-1021-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=The Enlightenment: And Why it Still Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnURng7tsWIC&amp;pg=PA100|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=100|isbn=978-0-19-966093-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown|first=Stuart|title=British Philosophy and the Age of Enlightenment: Routledge History of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoIafbj8pFgC&amp;pg=PA256 |year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=256|isbn=978-0-415-30877-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayle (1647–1706) observed that, in his day, "prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion]," and he believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bayle|first=Pierre|title=A general dictionary: historical and critical: in which a new and accurate translation of that of the celebrated Mr. Bayle, with the corrections and observations printed in the late edition at Paris, is included; and interspersed with several thousand lives never before published.

===Separation of church and state===
{{Main|Separation of church and state|Separation of church and state in the United States}}

The "Radical Enlightenment"{{sfn|Israel|2011|pp=11}}{{sfn|Israel|2010|p=19}} promoted the concept of separating church and state,{{sfn|Israel|2010|pp=vii–viii}} an idea that is often credited to English philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704).&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29 ("It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.")&lt;/ref&gt; According to his principle of the [[social contract]], Locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he said must therefore remain protected from any government authority.

These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with the social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] called for a "wall of separation between church and state" at the federal level. He previously had supported successful efforts to disestablish the [[Church of England]] in Virginia&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ferling2000|Ferling, 2000]], p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; and authored the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mayer|Mayer, 1994]] p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's political ideals were greatly influenced by the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kayes|Hayes, 2008]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; whom he considered the three greatest men that ever lived.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2003]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==National variations==
[[File:Europe, 1700 - 1714.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Europe at the beginning of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], 1700]]

The Enlightenment took hold in most European countries, often with a specific local emphasis. For example, in France it became associated with anti-government and anti-Church radicalism, while in Germany it reached deep into the middle classes, where it expressed a spiritualistic and nationalistic tone without threatening governments or established churches.&lt;ref&gt;David N. Livingstone and Charles W.J. Withers, ''Geography and Enlightenment'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Government responses varied widely. In France, the government was hostile, and the ''philosophes''&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt; fought against its censorship, sometimes being imprisoned or hounded into exile. The British government, for the most part, ignored the Enlightenment's leaders in England and Scotland, although it did give Isaac Newton a knighthood and a very lucrative government office. A common theme among most countries which derived enlightenment ideas from Europe was the intentional non-inclusion of enlightenment philosophies pertaining to slavery. Originally during the French Revolution, a revolution deeply inspired by enlightenment philosophy, "France's revolutionary government had denounced slavery, but the property-holding 'revolutionaries' then remembered their bank accounts."&lt;ref&gt;A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present, Second Edition, by Teresa A. Meade&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery often showed the limitations of the enlightenment as it pertained to European countries since many European countries held colonies supported by slavery. For instance, during the [[Haitian Revolution]] England and the United States supported France "rather than giving aid to Saint-Domingue's anti-colonial struggle."&lt;ref&gt;A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present, Second Edition, by Teresa A. Meade&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain===
====England====
{{Further|Georgian era#English Enlightenment}}

The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars. The majority of textbooks on British history make little or no mention of an English Enlightenment. Some surveys of the entire Enlightenment include England and others ignore it, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds and Jonathan Swift.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed. ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Porter]] argues that the reasons for this neglect were the assumptions that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and that it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, "England" in Alan Charles Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 1:409–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter admits that, after the 1720s, England could claim thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire or Rousseau. However, its leading intellectuals such as [[Edward Gibbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen O'Brien, "English Enlightenment Histories, 1750–c.1815"  in {{cite book |editor=José Rabasa |title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 3: 1400–1800 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&amp;pg=PA518 |year=2012 |location = Oxford, England |publisher=OUP |pages=518–35 |isbn=978-0-19-921917-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Samuel Johnson]] were all quite conservative and supportive of the standing order. Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The creation of the modern world: the untold story of the British Enlightenment'' (2000), pp. 1–12, 482–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Scottish Enlightenment, Scotland's major cities created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions such as universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums and masonic lodges.{{sfn|Israel|2011|pp=248–49}} The Scottish network was "predominantly liberal Calvinist, Newtonian, and 'design' oriented in character which played a major role in the further development of the transatlantic Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="HermanTwo"&gt;A. Herman, ''How the Scots Invented the Modern World'' (Crown Publishing Group, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Voltaire]] said that "we look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Lawrence E.|title=Jews, Confucians, and Protestants: Cultural Capital and the End of Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rbqn4RfUMioC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=92|isbn=978-1-4422-1964-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of [[William Cullen]], physician and chemist; [[James Anderson of Hermiston|James Anderson]], an [[agronomist]]; [[Joseph Black]], physicist and chemist; and [[James Hutton]], the first modern geologist.&lt;ref name="Denby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Repcheck"&gt;J.

Several Americans, especially [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], played a major role in bringing Enlightenment ideas to the New World and in influencing British and French thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Henry F. May, ''The Enlightenment in America'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was influential for his political activism and for his advances in physics.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Atiyah, "Benjamin Franklin and the Edinburgh Enlightenment," ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' (Dec 2006) 150#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;591–606.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fruchtman, Jr., ''Atlantic Cousins: Benjamin Franklin and His Visionary Friends'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural exchange during the Age of Enlightenment ran in both directions across the Atlantic. Thinkers such as Paine, Locke and Rousseau all take Native American cultural practices as examples of natural freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Mann, ''1491'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans closely followed English and Scottish political ideas, as well as some French thinkers such as [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Spurlin, ''Montesquieu in America, 1760–1801'' (1941)&lt;/ref&gt; As deists, they were influenced by ideas of [[John Toland]] (1670–1722) and [[Matthew Tindal]] (1656–1733). During the Enlightenment there was a great emphasis upon [[Liberalism in the United States|liberty]], [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] and [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious tolerance]]. There was no respect for monarchy or inherited political power. Deists reconciled science and religion by rejecting prophecies, miracles and Biblical theology. Leading deists included [[Thomas Paine]] in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' and by Thomas Jefferson in his short ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'' – from which all supernatural aspects were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1272214/The-Founding-Fathers-Deism-and-Christianity|title=The Founding Fathers, Deism, and Christianity|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German states===

Prussia took the lead among the German states in sponsoring the political reforms that Enlightenment thinkers urged absolute rulers to adopt. There were important movements as well in the smaller states of Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover and the Palatinate. In each case, Enlightenment values became accepted and led to significant political and administrative reforms that laid the groundwork for the creation of modern states.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ingrao, "A Pre-Revolutionary Sonderweg." ''German History'' 20#3 (2002), pp. 279–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The princes of Saxony, for example, carried out an impressive series of fundamental fiscal, administrative, judicial, educational, cultural and general economic reforms. The reforms were aided by the country's strong urban structure and influential commercial groups and modernized pre-1789 Saxony along the lines of classic Enlightenment principles.&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Keller, "Saxony: Rétablissement and Enlightened Absolutism." ''German History'' 20.3 (2002): 309–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The German Enlightenment", ''German History'' (Dec 2017) 35#4 pp 588-602, round table discussion of historiography.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oer-Weimarer Musenhof.jpg|thumb|left|''Weimar's Courtyard of the Muses'', a tribute to [[The Enlightenment]] and the [[Weimar Classicism]] depicting German poets [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]]]

Before 1750, the German upper classes looked to France for intellectual, cultural and architectural leadership, as French was the language of high society. By the mid-18th century, the ''Aufklärung'' ([[The Enlightenment]]) had transformed German high culture in music, philosophy, science and literature. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754) was the pioneer as a writer who expounded the Enlightenment to German readers and legitimized German as a philosophic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John G. | last=Gagliardo | title=Germany under the Old Regime, 1600–1790 | year=1991 | pages=217–34, 375–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] (1744–1803) broke new ground in philosophy and poetry, as a leader of the [[Sturm und Drang]] movement of proto-Romanticism. [[Weimar Classicism]] (''Weimarer Klassik'') was a cultural and literary movement based in Weimar that sought to establish a new humanism by synthesizing Romantic, classical and Enlightenment ideas. The movement (from 1772 until 1805) involved Herder as well as polymath [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759–1805), a poet and historian. Herder argued that every folk had its own particular identity, which was expressed in its language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German language and culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism. Schiller's plays expressed the restless spirit of his generation, depicting the hero's struggle against social pressures and the force of destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor-first=Simon J. |editor-last=Richter | title=The Literature of Weimar Classicism | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German music, sponsored by the upper classes, came of age under composers [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685–1750), [[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809) and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756–1791).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Samantha | editor-last=Owens | editor2-last =Reul | editor2-first =Barbara M. | editor3-last =Stockigt | editor3-first =Janice B. | title=Music at German Courts, 1715–1760: Changing Artistic Priorities | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In remote [[Königsberg]], philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom and political authority. Kant's work contained basic tensions that would continue to shape German thought – and indeed all of European philosophy – well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Manfred | last=Kuehn | title=Kant: A Biography | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Enlightenment won the support of princes, aristocrats and the middle classes and it permanently reshaped the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Van Dulmen | editor2-first=Anthony | editor2-last=Williams | title=The Society of the Enlightenment: The Rise of the Middle Class and Enlightenment Culture in Germany | year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was a conservatism among the elites that warned against going too far.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas P. Saine]], ''The Problem of Being Modern, or the German Pursuit of Enlightenment from Leibniz to the French Revolution'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s, Lutheran ministers  [[Johann Heinrich Schulz]] and Karl Wilhelm Brumbey got in trouble with their preaching as they were attacked and ridiculed by Immanuel Kant, [[Wilhelm Abraham Teller]] and others. In 1788, Prussia issued an "Edict on Religion" that forbade preaching any sermon that undermined popular belief in the Holy Trinity and the Bible. The goal was to avoid skepticism, deism and theological disputes that might impinge on domestic tranquility. Men who doubted the value of Enlightenment favoured the measure, but so too did many supporters. German universities had created a closed elite that could debate controversial issues among themselves, but spreading them to the public was seen as too risky. This intellectual elite was favoured by the state, but that might be reversed if the process of the Enlightenment proved politically or socially destabilizing.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Sauter, "The Enlightenment on trial: state service and social discipline in eighteenth-century Germany's public sphere." ''Modern Intellectual History'' 5.2 (2008): 195–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The Enlightenment played a distinctive, if small, role in the history of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dino Carpanetto and Giuseppe Ricuperati, ''Italy in the Age of Reason, 1685–1789'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burr Litchfield, "Italy" in Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 2:270–76&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of Italy was controlled by conservative Habsburgs or the pope, Tuscany had some opportunities for reform. [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Leopold II of Tuscany]] abolished the death penalty in Tuscany and reduced censorship. From Naples, [[Antonio Genovesi]] (1713–1769) influenced a generation of southern Italian intellectuals and university students. His textbook "Diceosina, o Sia della Filosofia del Giusto e dell'Onesto" (1766) was a controversial attempt to mediate between the history of moral philosophy on the one hand and the specific problems encountered by 18th-century commercial society on the other. It contained the greater part of Genovesi's political, philosophical and economic thought – guidebook for Neapolitan economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Guasti, "Antonio genovesi's Diceosina: Source of the Neapolitan Enlightenment." ''History of European ideas''  32.4 (2006): 385–405.&lt;/ref&gt; Science flourished as [[Alessandro Volta]] and [[Luigi Galvani]] made break-through discoveries in electricity. [[Pietro Verri]] was a leading economist in Lombardy. Historian [[Joseph Schumpeter]] states he was "the most important pre-Smithian authority on Cheapness-and-Plenty".&lt;ref&gt;Pier Luigi Porta, "Lombard enlightenment and classical political economy." ''The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought'' 18.4 (2011): 521–50.&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential scholar on the Italian Enlightenment has been [[Franco Venturi]].&lt;ref&gt;Franco Venturi, ''Italy and the Enlightenment: studies in a cosmopolitan century'' (1972) [https://archive.org/details/italyenlightenme00vent online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Maria Rao, "Enlightenment and reform: an overview of culture and politics in Enlightenment Italy." ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 10.2 (2005): 142–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy also produced some of the Enlightenment's greatest legal theorists, including [[Cesare Beccaria]], [[Giambattista Vico]] and [[Francesco Mario Pagano]]. Beccaria in particular is now considered one of the fathers of [[Classical school (criminology)|classical criminal theory]] as well as modern [[penology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hostettler|first=John|title=Cesare Beccaria: The Genius of 'On Crimes and Punishments'|date=2011|publisher=Waterside Press|location=Hampshire|isbn=978-1904380634|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beccaria is famous for his masterpiece ''[[On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1764), a treatise (later translated into 22 languages) that served as one of the earliest prominent condemnations of torture and the death penalty and thus a landmark work in [[anti-death penalty]] philosophy.&lt;ref name="history-world.org" /&gt;

===Russia===
In Russia, the government began to actively encourage the proliferation of arts and sciences in the mid-18th century. This era produced the first Russian university, library, theatre, public museum and independent press. Like other [[enlightened absolutism|enlightened despots]], [[Catherine the Great]] played a key role in fostering the arts, sciences and education. She used her own interpretation of Enlightenment ideals, assisted by notable international experts such as Voltaire (by correspondence) and in residence world class scientists such as [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Peter Simon Pallas]]. The national Enlightenment differed from its Western European counterpart in that it promoted further [[modernization]] of all aspects of Russian life and was concerned with attacking the institution of [[serfdom in Russia]]. The Russian enlightenment centered on the individual instead of societal enlightenment and encouraged the living of an enlightened life.&lt;ref&gt;Elise Kimerling Wirtschafter, "Thoughts on the Enlightenment and Enlightenment in Russia", ''Modern Russian History &amp; Historiography'', 2009, Vol. 2 Issue 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–26&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Israel|2011|pp=609–32}} A powerful element was ''prosveshchenie'' which combined religious piety, erudition and commitment to the spread of learning. However, it lacked the skeptical and critical spirit of the Western European Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Colum Leckey, "What is Prosveshchenie? Nikolai Novikov's Historical Dictionary of Russian Writers Revisited." ''Russian History'' 37.4 (2010): 360–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
{{Main|History of Portugal (1640–1777)}}
The enlightenment in Portugal (''iluminismo'') was marked by the rule of the Prime Minister [[Marquis of Pombal]] under King [[Joseph I of Portugal]] from 1756 to 1777. Following the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] which destroyed great part of Lisbon, the [[Marquis of Pombal]] implemented important economic policies to regulate commercial activity (in particular with Brazil and England), and to standardise quality throughout the country (for example by introducing the first integrated industries in Portugal). His reconstruction of [[Lisbon]]'s riverside district in straight and perpendicular streets, methodically organized to facilitate commerce and exchange (for example by assigning to each street a different product or service), can be seen as a direct application of the Enlightenment ideas to governance and urbanism. His urbanistic ideas, also being the first large-scale example of [[earthquake engineering]], became collectively known as [[Pombaline style]], and were implemented throughout the kingdom during his stay in office. His governance was as enlightened as ruthless, see for example the [[Távora affair]].

In literature, the first Enlightenment ideas in Portugal can be traced back to the diplomat, philosopher, and writer [[António Vieira]] (1608-1697){{citation needed|date=July 2019}}, who spent a considerable amount of his life in [[colonial Brazil]] denouncing discriminations against [[New Christians]] and the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]]. His works remain today as one of the best pieces of [[Portuguese literature]]{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}. During the 18th century, enlightened literary movements such as the [[Arcádia Lusitana]] (lasting from 1756 until 1776, then replaced by the [[Nova Arcádia]] in 1790 until 1794) surfaced in the academic medium, in particular involving former students of the [[University of Coimbra]]. A distinct member of this group was the poet [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]].

The ideas of the enlightenment also influenced various economists and anti-colonial intellectuals throughout the [[Portuguese Empire]], such as [[José de Azeredo Coutinho]], [[José da Silva Lisboa]], [[Cláudio Manoel da Costa]], and [[Tomás de Antônio Gonzaga]].

===Poland===
[[File:Manuscript of the Constitution of the 3rd May 1791.PNG|thumb|[[Constitution of 3 May, 1791]], Europe's first modern constitution]]
{{Main|Enlightenment in Poland}}
Enlightenment ideas (''oświecenie'') emerged late in [[History of Poland|Poland]], as the Polish middle class  was weaker and [[szlachta]] (nobility) culture ([[Sarmatism]]) together with the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] political system ([[Golden Liberty]]) were in deep crisis. The political system was built on [[republicanism]], but was unable to defend itself against powerful neighbors Russia, Prussia and Austria as they repeatedly sliced off regions until nothing was left of independent Poland. The period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–1740s and especially in theatre and the arts peaked in the reign of King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] (second half of the 18th century). Warsaw was a main centre after 1750, with an expansion of schools and educational institutions and the arts patronage held at the Royal Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Janowski, "Warsaw and Its Intelligentsia: Urban Space and Social Change, 1750–1831." ''Acta Poloniae Historica'' 100 (2009): 57–77. {{ISSN|0001-6829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders promoted tolerance and more education. They included King Stanislaw II Poniatowski and reformers Piotr Switkowski, Antoni Poplawski, Josef Niemcewicz and Jósef Pawlinkowski, as well as Baudouin de Cortenay, a Polonized dramatist. Opponents included Florian Jaroszewicz, Gracjan Piotrowski, Karol Wyrwicz and Wojciech Skarszewski.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Butterwick, "What is Enlightenment (oświecenie)? Some Polish Answers, 1765–1820."

The movement went into decline with the [[Third Partition of Poland]] (1795) – a national tragedy inspiring a short period of sentimental writing – and ended in 1822, replaced by [[Romanticism in Poland|Romanticism]].&lt;ref name="JS"&gt;Jerzy Snopek, [http://f.poland.pl/files/86/0/234/Literature_of_Enlightenment.pdf  "The Polish Literature of the Enlightenment."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005232247/http://f.poland.pl/files/86/0/234/Literature_of_Enlightenment.pdf |date=2011-10-05 }} (PDF 122 KB) ''Poland.pl.'' {{nowrap|Retrieved October 7, 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
The Enlightenment has always been contested territory. According to Keith Thomas, its supporters "hail it as the source of everything that is progressive about the modern world. For them, it stands for freedom of thought, rational inquiry, critical thinking, religious tolerance, political liberty, scientific achievement, the pursuit of happiness, and hope for the future."&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, "The Great Fight Over the Enlightenment," [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/apr/03/great-fight-over-enlightenment/ ''The New York Review'' April 3, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas adds that its detractors accuse it of shallow rationalism, naïve optimism, unrealistic universalism and moral darkness. From the start, conservative and clerical defenders of traditional religion attacked materialism and skepticism as evil forces that encouraged immorality. By 1794, they pointed to [[the Terror]] during the French Revolution as confirmation of their predictions. As the Enlightenment was ending, Romantic philosophers argued that excessive dependence on reason was a mistake perpetuated by the Enlightenment because it disregarded the bonds of history, myth, faith, and tradition that were necessary to hold society together.&lt;ref name="Thomas, 2014"&gt;Thomas, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
The term "Enlightenment" emerged in English in the later part of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd Edn (revised)&lt;/ref&gt; with particular reference to French philosophy, as the equivalent of the French term ''Lumières'' (used first by Dubos in 1733 and already well established by 1751). From [[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1784 essay "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?" ("[[Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]"), the German term became ''Aufklärun''g (''aufklären'' = to illuminate; ''sich aufklären'' = to clear up). However, scholars have never agreed on a definition of the Enlightenment, or on its chronological or geographical extent. Terms like ''les Lumières'' ([[French language|French]]), ''illuminism''o ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''ilustración'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) and ''Aufklärung'' ([[German language|German]]) referred to partly overlapping movements. Not until the late nineteenth century did English scholars agree they were talking about "the Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="Thomas, 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Lough |title=Reflections on Enlightenment and Lumieres |year=1985 |volume= 8#1 |pages= 1–15 |doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.1985.tb00093.x |journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice full.jpg|thumb|upright|If there is something you know, communicate it. If there is something you don't know, search for it.&lt;div style="text-align:right;"&gt;— An engraving from the 1772 edition of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''; [[Truth]], in the top center, is surrounded by light and unveiled by the figures to the right, [[Philosophy]] and [[Reason]]&lt;/div&gt;]]

Enlightenment [[historiography]] began in the period itself, from what Enlightenment figures said about their work. A dominant element was the intellectual angle they took. [[D'Alembert's]] ''Preliminary Discourse of l'Encyclopédie'' provides a history of the Enlightenment which comprises a chronological list of developments in the realm of knowledge – of which the ''Encyclopédie'' forms the pinnacle.&lt;ref&gt;Jean le Rond d'Alembert, ''Discours préliminaire de l'Encyclopédie''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, Jewish philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] referred to Enlightenment as a process by which man was educated in the use of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 1. The past tense is used deliberately as whether man would educate himself or be educated by certain exemplary figures was a common issue at the time. D'Alembert's introduction to l'Encyclopédie, for example, along with Immanuel Kant's essay response (the "independent thinkers"), both support the later model.&lt;/ref&gt; Immanuel Kant called Enlightenment "man's release from his self-incurred tutelage", tutelage being "man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, "What is Enlightenment?", 1.&lt;/ref&gt; "For Kant, Enlightenment was mankind's final coming of age, the emancipation of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German scholar [[Ernst Cassirer]] called the Enlightenment "a part and a special phase of that whole intellectual development through which modern philosophic thought gained its characteristic self-confidence and self-consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Cassirer, ''The Philosophy of the Enlightenment'', (1951), p. vi&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Roy Porter]], the liberation of the human mind from a dogmatic state of ignorance, is the epitome of what the Age of Enlightenment was trying to capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] saw the Enlightenment as a phase in a progressive development which began in antiquity and that reason and challenges to the established order were constant ideals throughout that time.&lt;ref name="Russell, Bertrand p492-494"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy''. pp.&amp;nbsp;492–94&lt;/ref&gt; Russell said that the Enlightenment was ultimately born out of the Protestant reaction against the Catholic [[counter-reformation]] and that philosophical views such as affinity for democracy against monarchy originated among 16th-century Protestants to justify their desire to break away from the Catholic Church. Although many of these philosophical ideals were picked up by Catholics, Russell argues that by the 18th century the Enlightenment was the principal manifestation of the schism that began with [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref name="Russell, Bertrand p492-494"/&gt;

Jonathan Israel rejects the attempts of postmodern and Marxian historians to understand the revolutionary ideas of the period purely as by-products of social and economic transformations.{{sfn|Israel|2010|pp=49–50}} He instead focuses on the [[history of ideas]] in the period from 1650 to the end of the 18th century and claims that it was the ideas themselves that caused the change that eventually led to the revolutions of the latter half of the 18th century and the early 19th century.{{sfn|Israel|2006|pp=v–viii}} Israel argues that until the 1650s Western civilization "was based on a largely shared core of faith, tradition and authority".{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=3}}

===Time span===
There is little consensus on the precise beginning of the Age of Enlightenment, though several historians and philosophers argue that it was marked by [[Descartes]]' 1637 philosophy of ''[[Cogito, ergo sum]]'' ("I think, therefore I Am"), which shifted the epistemological basis from external authority to internal certainty.&lt;ref name="Heidegger1938emancipated"&gt;Martin Heidegger [1938] (2002) ''The Age of the World Picture'' quotation: {{quote|For up to Descartes ... a particular ''sub-iectum'' ... lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualities and changing circumstances. The superiority of a ''sub-iectum'' ... arises out of the claim of man to a ... self-supported, unshakeable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty. Why and how does this claim acquire its decisive authority? The claim originates in that emancipation of man in which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself that takes its stand upon itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingraffia95p126"&gt;Ingraffia, Brian D. (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LHjZYbOLG8cC&amp;pg=PA126 ''Postmodern theory and biblical theology: vanquishing God's shadow''] p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman K.

Shank, ''The Newton Wars and the Beginning of the French Enlightenment'' (2008), "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; The middle of the 17th century (1650) or the beginning of the 18th century (1701) are often used as [[epoch]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} French historians usually place the ''Siècle des Lumières'' ("Century of Enlightenments") between 1715 and 1789: from the beginning of the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] until the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Anderson, ''Historians and eighteenth-century Europe, 1715-1789'' (Oxford UP, 1979); Jean de Viguerie, ''Histoire et dictionnaire du temps des Lumières (1715-1789)'' (Paris: Robert Laffont, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars use the last years of the century, often choosing the French Revolution of 1789 or the beginning of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1804–1815) as a convenient point in time with which to date the end of the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/enlightenment_age.html |title=The age of Enlightenment |author=Frost, Martin |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-01-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010041056/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/enlightenment_age.html |archivedate=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern study===
In the 1947 book ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', [[Frankfurt School]] philosophers [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] argued: {{quote|Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates under the sign of disaster triumphant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments |year=1947 |author1=Theodor W.

Extending Horkheimer and Adorno's argument, intellectual historian Jason Josephson-Storm has argued that any idea of the Age of Enlightenment as a clearly defined period that is separate from the earlier [[Renaissance]] and later [[Romanticism]] or [[Counter-Enlightenment]] constitutes a myth. Josephson-Storm points out that there are vastly different and mutually contradictory periodizations of the Enlightenment depending on nation, field of study, and school of thought; that the term and category of "Enlightenment" referring to the scientific revolution was actually applied after the fact; that the Enlightenment did not see an increase in [[disenchantment]] or the dominance of the [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic worldview]]; and that a blur in the early modern ideas of the [[Humanities]] and [[natural sciences]] makes it hard to circumscribe a Scientific Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 2017 |pages = 58–61 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephson-Storm defends his categorization of the Enlightenment as "myth" by noting the regulative role ideas of a period of Enlightenment and disenchantment play in modern Western culture, such that belief in magic, spiritualism, and even religion appears somewhat taboo in intellectual strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 2017 |pages = 61–62 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, study of the Enlightenment expanded to include the ways Enlightenment ideas spread to European colonies and how they interacted with indigenous cultures and how the Enlightenment took place in formerly unstudied areas such as Italy, Greece, the Balkans, Poland, Hungary and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 6. See also, A. Owen Alridge (ed.), ''The Ibero-American Enlightenment'' (1971)., Franco Venturi, ''The End of the Old Regime in Europe 1768–1776: The First Crisis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectuals such as [[Robert Darnton]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] have focused on the social conditions of the Enlightenment. Habermas described the creation of the "bourgeois public sphere" in 18th-century Europe, containing the new venues and modes of communication allowing for rational exchange. Habermas said that the public sphere was bourgeois, egalitarian, rational and independent from the state, making it the ideal venue for intellectuals to critically examine contemporary politics and society, away from the interference of established authority. While the public sphere is generally an integral component of the social study of the Enlightenment, other historians{{NoteTag|For example, Robert Darnton, Roger Chartier, Brian Cowan, Donna T. Andrew.}} have questioned whether the public sphere had these characteristics.

==Society and culture==
[[File:Josef II medal.jpg|thumb|A medal minted during the reign of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], commemorating his grant of religious liberty to [[Jews]] and [[Protestants]] in Hungary—another important reform of Joseph II was the abolition of [[serfdom]]]]

In contrast to the intellectual historiographical approach of the Enlightenment, which examines the various currents or discourses of intellectual thought within the European context during the 17th and 18th centuries, the cultural (or social) approach examines the changes that occurred in European society and culture. This approach studies the process of changing sociabilities and cultural practices during the Enlightenment.

One of the primary elements of the culture of the Enlightenment was the rise of the [[public sphere]], a "realm of communication marked by new arenas of debate, more open and accessible forms of urban public space and sociability, and an explosion of print culture", in the late 17th century and 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;James Van Horn Melton, ''The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe'' (2001), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of the public sphere included that it was egalitarian, that it discussed the domain of "common concern," and that argument was founded on reason.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'', (1989), pp. 36, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas uses the term "common concern" to describe those areas of political/social knowledge and discussion that were previously the exclusive territory of the state and religious authorities, now open to critical examination by the public sphere. The values of this bourgeois public sphere included holding reason to be supreme, considering everything to be open to criticism (the public sphere is [[critical thought|critical]]), and the opposition of secrecy of all sorts.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexandre humboldt.jpg|thumb|upright|left|German explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] showed his disgust for slavery and often criticized the colonial policies—he always acted out of a deeply humanistic conviction, borne by the ideas of the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaas A. Rupke (2008). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_fXXRzidVKMC#v=onepage Alexander Von Humboldt: A Metabiography]''". University of Chicago Press. p. 138 {{ISBN|0-226-73149-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The creation of the public sphere has been associated with two long-term historical trends: the rise of the modern nation state and the rise of [[capitalism]]. The modern nation state, in its consolidation of public power, created by counterpoint a private realm of society independent of the state, which allowed for the public sphere. Capitalism also increased society's [[autonomy]] and [[self-awareness]], as well as an increasing need for the exchange of information. As the nascent public sphere expanded, it embraced a large variety of [[institutions]] and the most commonly cited were coffee houses and cafés, salons and the literary public sphere, figuratively localized in the Republic of Letters.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, 4, 5. Habermas, 14–26.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the creation of the public sphere was helped by the aristocracy's move from the King's palace at Versailles to Paris in about 1720, since their rich spending stimulated the trade in luxuries and artistic creations, especially fine paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Daniel Brewer |title=The Cambridge Companion to the French Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mry1BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=91ff|isbn=978-1-316-19432-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context for the rise of the public sphere was the economic and social change commonly associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]]: "Economic expansion, increasing urbanization, rising population and improving communications in comparison to the stagnation of the previous century".&lt;ref&gt;Outram, Dorinda. ''The Enlightenment'' (2nd ed.). Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Rising efficiency in production techniques and communication lowered the prices of consumer goods and increased the amount and variety of goods available to consumers (including the literature essential to the public sphere). Meanwhile, the colonial experience (most European states had colonial empires in the 18th century) began to expose European society to extremely heterogeneous cultures, leading to the breaking down of "barriers between cultural systems, religious divides, gender differences and geographical areas".&lt;ref&gt;Outram 2005, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "public" implies the highest level of inclusivity – the public sphere by definition should be open to all. However, this sphere was only public to relative degrees. Enlightenment thinkers frequently contrasted their conception of the "public" with that of the people: [[Condorcet]] contrasted "opinion" with populace, [[Jean-François Marmontel|Marmontel]] "the opinion of men of letters" with "the opinion of the multitude" and [[d'Alembert]] the "truly enlightened public" with "the blind and noisy multitude".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, most institutions of the public sphere excluded both women and the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Mona Ozouf, "'Public Opinion' at the End of the Old Regime&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-class influences occurred through noble and lower class participation in areas such as the coffeehouses and the Masonic lodges.

===Social and cultural implications in the arts===
Because of the focus on reason over superstition, the Enlightenment cultivated the arts.&lt;ref&gt;David Beard and Kenneth Gloag, ''Musicology, The Key Concepts'' (New York: Routledge, 2005), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis on learning, art and music became more widespread, especially with the growing middle class. Areas of study such as literature, philosophy, science, and the fine arts increasingly explored subject matter to which the general public, in addition to the previously more segregated professionals and patrons, could relate.&lt;ref&gt;J. Peter Burkholder, Donald J. Grout and Claude V. Palisca, ''A History of Western Music, Seventh Edition'', (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 2006), 475.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Frideric Handel by Balthasar Denner.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[George Frideric Handel]]]]
As musicians depended more and more on public support, public concerts became increasingly popular and helped supplement performers' and composers' incomes. The concerts also helped them to reach a wider audience. [[Handel]], for example, epitomized this with his highly public musical activities in [[London]]. He gained considerable fame there with performances of his operas and oratorios. The music of [[Haydn]] and [[Mozart]], with their Viennese Classical styles, are usually regarded as being the most in line with the Enlightenment ideals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire to explore, record and systematize knowledge had a meaningful impact on music publications. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''Dictionnaire de musique'' (published 1767 in Geneva and 1768 in Paris) was a leading text in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This widely available dictionary gave short definitions of words like genius and taste and was clearly influenced by the Enlightenment movement. Another text influenced by Enlightenment values was [[Charles Burney]]'s ''A General History of Music: From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period'' (1776), which was a historical survey and an attempt to rationalize elements in music systematically over time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, musicologists have shown renewed interest in the ideas and consequences of the Enlightenment. For example, [[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]]'s ''Deconstructive Variations'' (subtitled ''Music and Reason in Western Society'') compares Mozart's ''Die Zauberflöte'' (1791) using the Enlightenment and Romantic perspectives and concludes that the work is "an ideal musical representation of the Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

As the economy and the middle class expanded, there was an increasing number of amateur musicians. One manifestation of this involved women, who became more involved with music on a social level. Women were already engaged in professional roles as singers and increased their presence in the amateur performers' scene, especially with keyboard music.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Burkholder, Grout and Palisca, ''A History of Western Music'', 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Music publishers begin to print music that amateurs could understand and play. The majority of the works that were published were for keyboard, voice and keyboard and chamber ensemble.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; After these initial genres were popularized, from the mid-century on, amateur groups sang choral music, which then became a new trend for publishers to capitalize on. The increasing study of the fine arts, as well as access to amateur-friendly published works, led to more people becoming interested in reading and discussing music. Music magazines, reviews and critical works which suited amateurs as well as connoisseurs began to surface.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Dissemination of ideas==
The ''philosophes''&lt;!-- "Philosophes" is correct. --&gt; spent a great deal of energy disseminating their ideas among educated men and women in cosmopolitan cities. They used many venues, some of them quite new.

[[File:Pierre Bayle.jpg|thumb|upright|French philosopher [[Pierre Bayle]]]]

===The Republic of Letters===
{{Main|Republic of Letters}}
The term "Republic of Letters" was coined in 1664 by [[Pierre Bayle]] in his journal ''Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres''. Towards the end of the 18th century, the editor of ''Histoire de la République des Lettres en France'', a literary survey, described the Republic of Letters as being: {{quote|In the midst of all the governments that decide the fate of men; in the bosom of so many states, the majority of them despotic&amp;nbsp;... there exists a certain realm which holds sway only over the mind&amp;nbsp;... that we honour with the name Republic, because it preserves a measure of independence, and because it is almost its essence to be free. It is the realm of talent and of thought.&lt;ref name="Outram, 21"/&gt;}}

The Republic of Letters was the sum of a number of Enlightenment ideals: an egalitarian realm governed by knowledge that could act across political boundaries and rival state power.&lt;ref name="Outram, 21"/&gt; It was a forum that supported "free public examination of questions regarding religion or legislation".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Immanuel Kant considered written communication essential to his conception of the public sphere; once everyone was a part of the "reading public", then society could be said to be enlightened.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 26, 26. Kant, "What is Enlightenment?"&lt;/ref&gt; The people who participated in the Republic of Letters, such as [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], are frequently known today as important Enlightenment figures. Indeed, the men who wrote Diderot's ''Encyclopédie'' arguably formed a microcosm of the larger "republic".&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gentleman's Magazine 1731.JPG|thumb|Front page of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', January 1731]]
Many women played an essential part in the French Enlightenment, due to the role they played as ''salonnières'' in Parisian salons, as the contrast to the male ''philosophes&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt;''. The salon was the principal social institution of the republic&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and "became the civil working spaces of the project of Enlightenment". Women, as salonnières, were "the legitimate governors of [the] potentially unruly discourse" that took place within.&lt;ref&gt;Dena Goodman, ''The Republic of Letters: A Cultural History of the French Enlightenment'' (1994), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; While women were marginalized in the public culture of the Old Regime, the French Revolution destroyed the old cultural and economic restraints of patronage and corporatism (guilds), opening French society to female participation, particularly in the literary sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Carla Hesse, ''The Other Enlightenment: How French Women Became Modern'' (2001), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the established men of letters (''gens de lettres'') had fused with the elites (''les grands'') of French society by the mid-18th century. This led to the creation of an oppositional literary sphere, [[Grub Street]], the domain of a "multitude of versifiers and would-be authors".&lt;ref&gt;Crébillon fils, quoted from Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt; These men came to London to become authors, only to discover that the literary market simply could not support large numbers of writers, who in any case were very poorly remunerated by the publishing-bookselling [[guild]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 19, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers of Grub Street, the Grub Street Hacks, were left feeling bitter about the relative success of the men of letters&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, "The Literary Underground", 21, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and found an outlet for their literature which was typified by the ''[[Libelle (literary genre)|libelle]]''. Written mostly in the form of pamphlets, the ''libelles'' "slandered the court, the Church, the aristocracy, the academies, the salons, everything elevated and respectable, including the monarchy itself".&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 29&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Gazetier cuirassé'' by Charles Théveneau de Morande was a prototype of the genre. It was Grub Street literature that was most read by the public during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Darnton, more importantly the Grub Street hacks inherited the "revolutionary spirit" once displayed by the ''philosophes&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt;'' and paved the way for the French Revolution by desacralizing figures of political, moral and religious authority in France.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 35–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The book industry===
[[File:1477-1799 ESTC titles per decade, statistics.png|thumb|left|[[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] data 1477–1799 by decade given with a regional differentiation]]

The increased consumption of reading materials of all sorts was one of the key features of the "social" Enlightenment. Developments in the Industrial Revolution allowed consumer goods to be produced in greater quantities at lower prices, encouraging the spread of books, pamphlets, newspapers and journals – "media of the transmission of ideas and attitudes". Commercial development likewise increased the demand for information, along with rising populations and increased urbanisation.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 17, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, demand for reading material extended outside of the realm of the commercial and outside the realm of the upper and middle classes, as evidenced by the [[Bibliothèque Bleue]]. Literacy rates are difficult to gauge, but in France the rates doubled over the course of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, "The Literary Underground", 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the decreasing influence of religion, the number of books about science and art published in Paris doubled from 1720 to 1780, while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total.{{sfn|Petitfils|2005|pages=99–105}}

Reading underwent serious changes in the 18th century. In particular, Rolf Engelsing has argued for the existence of a ''[[Reading Revolution]]''. Until 1750, reading was done intensively: people tended to own a small number of books and read them repeatedly, often to small audience. After 1750, people began to read "extensively", finding as many books as they could, increasingly reading them alone.&lt;ref&gt;from Outram, 19. See Rolf Engelsing, "Die Perioden der Lesergeschichte in der Neuzeit. Das statische Ausmass und die soziokulturelle Bedeutung der Lektüre", Archiv für Geschichte des Buchwesens, 10 (1969), cols. 944–1002 and Der Bürger als Leser: Lesergeschichte in Deutschland, 1500–1800 (Stuttgart, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by increasing literacy rates, particularly among women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/history-of-publishing/28681/Developments-in-the-18th-century |title=history of publishing :: Developments in the 18th century|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the reading public could not afford to own a private library and while most of the state-run "universal libraries" set up in the 17th and 18th centuries were open to the public, they were not the only sources of reading material. On one end of the spectrum was the ''Bibliothèque Bleue'', a collection of cheaply produced books published in Troyes, France. Intended for a largely rural and semi-literate audience these books included almanacs, retellings of medieval romances and condensed versions of popular novels, among other things. While some historians have argued against the Enlightenment's penetration into the lower classes, the ''Bibliothèque Bleue'' represents at least a desire to participate in Enlightenment sociability.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; Moving up the classes, a variety of institutions offered readers access to material without needing to buy anything. Libraries that lent out their material for a small price started to appear and occasionally bookstores would offer a small lending library to their patrons. Coffee houses commonly offered books, journals and sometimes even popular novels to their customers. ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]'', two influential periodicals sold from 1709 to 1714, were closely associated with coffee house culture in London, being both read and produced in various establishments in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Mackie, ''The Commerce of Everyday Life: Selections from The Tatler and The Spectator'' (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 1998), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the triple or even quadruple function of the coffee house: reading material was often obtained, read, discussed and even produced on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;See Mackie, Darnton, ''An Early Information Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Denis Diderot 111.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Denis Diderot]] is best known as the editor of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'']]
It is extremely difficult to determine what people actually read during the Enlightenment. For example, examining the catalogs of private libraries gives an image skewed in favor of the classes wealthy enough to afford libraries and also ignores censored works unlikely to be publicly acknowledged. For this reason, a study of publishing would be much more fruitful for discerning reading habits.&lt;ref&gt;In particular, see Chapter 6, "Reading, Writing and Publishing"&lt;/ref&gt;

Across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. For example, the ''Encyclopédie'' narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]], the man in charge of the French censor. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers.&lt;ref&gt;See Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 135–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, "general works" (those books "that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority"), demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature. However, these works never became part of literary canon and are largely forgotten today as a result.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

A healthy, legal publishing industry existed throughout Europe, although established publishers and book sellers occasionally ran afoul of the law. For example, the ''Encyclopédie'' condemned not only by the King, but also by Clement XII, nevertheless found its way into print with the help of the aforementioned Malesherbes and creative use of French censorship law.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Business of Enlightenment'', 12, 13. For a more detailed description of French censorship laws, see Darnton, ''The Literary Underground''&lt;/ref&gt; However, many works were sold without running into any legal trouble at all. Borrowing records from libraries in England, Germany, and North America indicate that more than 70&amp;nbsp;percent of books borrowed were novels. Less than 1&amp;nbsp;percent of the books were of a religious nature, indicating the general trend of declining religiosity.&lt;ref name="Outram, 21"&gt;Outram, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural history===
[[File:Buffon 1707-1788.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges Buffon]] is best remembered for his {{lang|fr|Histoire naturelle}}, a 44 volume encyclopedia describing everything known about the natural world]]
{{Main|Natural history}}
A genre that greatly rose in importance was that of scientific literature. Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. Works of natural history include [[René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur]]'s ''Histoire naturelle des insectes'' and [[Jacques Gautier d'Agoty]]'s ''La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain'' (1746). Outside [[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]] France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by Matthew Daniel Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas.&lt;ref name="Eddy 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School, 1750–1800|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The target audience of natural history was French polite society, evidenced more by the specific discourse of the genre than by the generally high prices of its works. Naturalists catered to polite society's desire for erudition – many texts had an explicit instructive purpose. However, natural history was often a political affair. As Emma Spary writes, the classifications used by naturalists "slipped between the natural world and the social&amp;nbsp;... to establish not only the expertise of the naturalists over the natural, but also the dominance of the natural over the social".&lt;ref&gt;Emma Spary, "The 'Nature' of Enlightenment" in ''The Sciences in Enlightened Europe'', William Clark, Jan Golinski, and Steven Schaffer, eds. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), 281–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of taste (''le goût'') was a social indicator: to truly be able to categorize nature, one had to have the proper taste, an ability of discretion shared by all members of polite society. In this way natural history spread many of the scientific developments of the time, but also provided a new source of legitimacy for the dominant class.&lt;ref&gt;Spary, 289–93.&lt;/ref&gt; From this basis, naturalists could then develop their own social ideals based on their scientific works.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas Laqueur, ''Making sex: body and gender from the Greeks to Freud'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific and literary journals===
[[File:1665 journal des scavans title.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Journal des sçavans]]'' was the earliest academic journal published in Europe]]
The first scientific and literary journals were established during the Enlightenment. The first journal, the Parisian ''[[Journal des Sçavans]]'', appeared in 1665. However, it was not until 1682 that periodicals began to be more widely produced. French and Latin were the dominant languages of publication, but there was also a steady demand for material in German and Dutch. There was generally low demand for English publications on the Continent, which was echoed by England's similar lack of desire for French works. Languages commanding less of an international market—such as Danish, Spanish and Portuguese—found journal success more difficult and more often than not a more international language was used instead. French slowly took over Latin's status as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of learned circles. This in turn gave precedence to the publishing industry in Holland, where the vast majority of these French language periodicals were produced.{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=143–44}}

Jonathan Israel called the journals the most influential cultural innovation of European intellectual culture.{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=142}} They shifted the attention of the "cultivated public" away from established authorities to novelty and innovation and instead promoted the "enlightened" ideals of toleration and intellectual objectivity. Being a source of knowledge derived from science and reason, they were an implicit critique of existing notions of universal truth monopolized by monarchies, parliaments and religious authorities. They also advanced Christian enlightenment that upheld "the legitimacy of God-ordained authority"—the Bible—in which there had to be agreement between the biblical and natural theories.{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=150–51}}

===Encyclopedias and dictionaries===
[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|upright|First page of the ''[[Encyclopedie]]'', published between 1751 and 1766]]
Although the existence of [[dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedia]]s spanned into ancient times, the texts changed from simply defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions of those words in 18th-century [[Encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopedic dictionaries]].&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 144"&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The works were part of an Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the elite. As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers' tastes. Volumes tended to focus more strongly on [[secular]] affairs, particularly science and technology, rather than matters of [[theology]].

Along with secular matters, readers also favoured an alphabetical ordering scheme over cumbersome works arranged along thematic lines.&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 172"&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on alphabetization, the historian [[Charles Porset]] has said that "as the zero degree of taxonomy, alphabetical order authorizes all reading strategies; in this respect it could be considered an emblem of the Enlightenment". For Porset, the avoidance of thematic and [[hierarchical]] systems thus allows free interpretation of the works and becomes an example of [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Encyclopedias and dictionaries also became more popular during the Age of Enlightenment as the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multiply.&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 144"/&gt; In the later half of the 18th century, the number of dictionaries and encyclopedias published by decade increased from 63 between 1760 and 1769 to approximately 148 in the decade proceeding the French Revolution (1780–1789).&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with growth in numbers, dictionaries and encyclopedias also grew in length, often having multiple print runs that sometimes included in supplemented editions.&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 172"/&gt;

The first technical dictionary was drafted by [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] and entitled ''[[Lexicon technicum|Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]''. Harris' book avoided theological and biographical entries and instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the ''Lexicon technicum'' was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial [[arithmetic]] along with the physical sciences and [[navigation]]. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris' model, including [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728), which included five editions and was a substantially larger work than Harris'. The [[Book binding|folio]] edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The ''Cyclopaedia'' emphasized Newtonian theories, [[John Locke|Lockean]] philosophy and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as [[engraving]], [[brewing]] and [[dyeing]]. [[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|upright|thumb|left|"[[Figurative system of human knowledge]]", the structure that the ''Encyclopédie'' organised knowledge into—it had three main branches: memory, reason and imagination]] In Germany, practical reference works intended for the uneducated majority became popular in the 18th century. The ''Marperger Curieuses Natur-, Kunst-, Berg-, Gewerkund Handlungs-Lexicon'' (1712) explained terms that usefully described the trades and scientific and commercial education. ''Jablonksi Allgemeines Lexicon'' (1721) was better known than the ''Handlungs-Lexicon'' and underscored technical subjects rather than scientific theory. For example, over five columns of text were dedicated to wine while geometry and [[logic]] were allocated only twenty-two and seventeen lines, respectively. The first edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1771) was modelled along the same lines as the German lexicons.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;150–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the prime example of reference works that systematized scientific knowledge in the age of Enlightenment were [[universal encyclopedia]]s rather than technical dictionaries. It was the goal of universal encyclopedias to record all human knowledge in a comprehensive reference work.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known of these works is [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers]]''. The work, which began publication in 1751, was composed of thirty-five volumes and over 71 000 separate entries. A great number of the entries were dedicated to describing the sciences and crafts in detail and provided intellectuals across Europe with a high-quality survey of human knowledge. In d'Alembert's ''Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot'', the work's goal to record the extent of human knowledge in the arts and sciences is outlined:

{{quote|As an Encyclopédie, it is to set forth as well as possible the order and connection of the parts of human knowledge. As a Reasoned Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Trades, it is to contain the general principles that form the basis of each science and each art, liberal or mechanical, and the most essential facts that make up the body and substance of each.&lt;ref&gt;d'Alembert, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The massive work was arranged according to a "tree of knowledge". The tree reflected the marked division between the arts and sciences, which was largely a result of the rise of empiricism. Both areas of knowledge were united by philosophy, or the trunk of the tree of knowledge. The Enlightenment's desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree's design, particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch, with black magic as a close neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As the ''Encyclopédie'' gained popularity, it was published in [[book binding|quarto]] and [[book binding|octavo]] editions after 1777. The quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions, making the ''Encyclopédie'' more accessible to the non-elite. Robert Darnton estimates that there were approximately 25 000 copies of the ''Encyclopédie'' in circulation throughout France and Europe before the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive, yet affordable encyclopedia came to represent the transmission of Enlightenment and scientific education to an expanding audience.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularization of science===
One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularization. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food. This enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for education.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, (1988), p. 191; Melton, (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured "to make information available to the greatest number of people".&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton's]] celebrated ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular.

[[File:Fontenelle.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of [[Bernard de Fontenelle]]]]
The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was [[Bernard de Fontenelle]]'s ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), pp. 85, 90&lt;/ref&gt; These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises and books published by the academies and scientists. [[Charles Leadbetter|Charles Leadbetter's]] ''Astronomy'' (1727) was advertised as "a Work entirely New" that would include "short and easie {{sic}} Rules and Astronomical Tables".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the ''Principia'' was ''Eléments de la philosophie de Newton'', published by Voltaire in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émilie du Châtelet]]'s translation of the ''Principia'', published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for a growing female audience, [[Francesco Algarotti]] published ''Il Newtonianism per le dame'', which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by [[Elizabeth Carter]]. A similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was produced by [[Henry Pemberton]]. His ''A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy'' was published by subscription. Extant records of subscribers show that women from a wide range of social standings purchased the book, indicating the growing number of scientifically inclined female readers among the middling class.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Enlightenment, women also began producing popular scientific works themselves. [[Sarah Trimmer]] wrote a successful natural history textbook for children titled ''The Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature'' (1782), which was published for many years after in eleven editions.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools and universities===
{{main|Education in the Age of Enlightenment}}
Most work on the Enlightenment emphasizes the ideals discussed by intellectuals, rather than the actual state of education at the time. Leading educational theorists like England's John Locke and Switzerland's Jean Jacques Rousseau both emphasized the importance of shaping young minds early. By the late Enlightenment, there was a rising demand for a more universal approach to education, particularly after the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s.

The predominant educational psychology from the 1750s onward, especially in northern European countries was associationism, the notion that the mind associates or dissociates ideas through repeated routines. In addition to being conducive to Enlightenment ideologies of liberty, self-determination and personal responsibility, it offered a practical theory of the mind that allowed teachers to transform longstanding forms of print and manuscript culture into effective graphic tools of learning for the lower and middle orders of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|journal=Science in Context|year=2013|volume=26|issue=2|pages=215–45|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033|doi=10.1017/s0269889713000045}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children were taught to memorize facts through oral and graphic methods that originated during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hotson|first=Howard|title=Commonplace Learning: Ramism and Its German Ramifications 1543–1630|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the leading universities associated with Enlightenment progressive principles were located in northern Europe, with the most renowned being the universities of Leiden, Göttingen, Halle, Montpellier, Uppsala and Edinburgh. These universities, especially Edinburgh, produced professors whose ideas had a significant impact on Britain's North American colonies and later the American Republic. Within the natural sciences, Edinburgh's medical school also led the way in chemistry, anatomy and pharmacology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School, 1750–1800|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other parts of Europe, the universities and schools of France and most of Europe were bastions of traditionalism and were not hospitable to the Enlightenment. In France, the major exception was the medical university at Montpellier.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Williams, ''A Cultural History of Medical Vitalism in Enlightenment Montpellier'' (2003) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learned academies===
[[File:Sébastien Leclerc I, Louis XIV Visiting the Royal Academy of Sciences, 1671.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis XIV]] visiting the {{lang|fr|[[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des sciences]]}} in 1671: "It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century, introducing a new understanding of the natural world" — Peter Barrett&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barrett (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fwxViwX6KuMC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage Science and Theology Since Copernicus: The Search for Understanding]'', p. 14, [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], {{ISBN|0-567-08969-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The history of Academies in France during the Enlightenment begins with the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Science]], founded in 1635 in Paris. It was closely tied to the French state, acting as an extension of a government seriously lacking in scientists. It helped promote and organize new disciplines and it trained new scientists. It also contributed to the enhancement of scientists' social status, considering them to be the "most useful of all citizens". Academies demonstrate the [[Scientific revolution|rising interest in science]] along with its increasing secularization, as evidenced by the small number of clerics who were members (13 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Roche'', France in the Enlightenment'', (1998), 420.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the French academies in the public sphere cannot be attributed to their membership, as although the majority of their members were bourgeois, the exclusive institution was only open to elite Parisian scholars. They perceived themselves as "interpreters of the sciences for the people". For example, it was with this in mind that academicians took it upon themselves to disprove the popular pseudo-science of [[mesmerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Roche, 515–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strongest contribution of the French Academies to the public sphere comes from the ''concours académiques'' (roughly translated as "academic contests") they sponsored throughout France. These academic contests were perhaps the most public of any institution during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Caradonna JL. ''Annales'', "Prendre part au siècle des Lumières: Le concours académique et la culture intellectuelle au XVIIIe siècle"&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of contests dated back to the Middle Ages and was revived in the mid-17th century. The subject matter had previously been generally religious and/or monarchical, featuring essays, poetry and painting. However, by roughly 1725 this subject matter had radically expanded and diversified, including "royal propaganda, philosophical battles, and critical ruminations on the social and political institutions of the Old Regime". Topics of public controversy were also discussed such as the theories of Newton and Descartes, the slave trade, women's education and justice in France.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy L. Caradonna, "Prendre part au siècle des Lumières: Le concours académique et la culture intellectuelle au XVIIIe siècle", ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences sociales'', vol. 64 (mai-juin 2009), n. 3, 633–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zoom lunette ardente.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] conducting an experiment related to combustion generated by amplified sun light]]
More importantly, the contests were open to all and the enforced anonymity of each submission guaranteed that neither gender nor social rank would determine the judging. Indeed, although the "vast majority" of participants belonged to the wealthier strata of society ("the liberal arts, the clergy, the judiciary and the medical profession"), there were some cases of the popular classes submitting essays and even winning.&lt;ref&gt;Caradonna, 634–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a significant number of women participated—and won—the competitions. Of a total of 2,300 prize competitions offered in France, women won 49—perhaps a small number by modern standards, but very significant in an age in which most women did not have any academic training. Indeed, the majority of the winning entries were for poetry competitions, a genre commonly stressed in women's education.&lt;ref&gt;Caradonna, 653–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the [[Royal Society of London]] also played a significant role in the public sphere and the spread of Enlightenment ideas. It was founded by a group of independent scientists and given a royal charter in 1662.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/royal-charters/|title=Royal Charters|work=royalsociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society played a large role in spreading [[Robert Boyle]]'s [[experimental philosophy]] around Europe and acted as a clearinghouse for intellectual correspondence and exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Shapin, ''A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England'', Chicago; London: University of Chicago Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle was "a founder of the experimental world in which scientists now live and operate" and his method based knowledge on experimentation, which had to be witnessed to provide proper empirical legitimacy. This is where the Royal Society came into play: witnessing had to be a "collective act" and the Royal Society's assembly rooms were ideal locations for relatively public demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), 5, 56, 57. This same desire for multiple witnesses led to attempts at replication in other locations and a complex iconography and literary technology developed to provide visual and written proof of experimentation. See pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not just any witness was considered to be credible: "Oxford professors were accounted more reliable witnesses than Oxfordshire peasants". Two factors were taken into account: a witness's knowledge in the area and a witness's "moral constitution". In other words, only civil society were considered for Boyle's public.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin and Schaffer, 58, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salons===
{{Main|Historiography of the salon}}
It was the place in which philosophes got reunited and talked about old, actual or new ideas. Salons were the place where intellectual and enlightened ideas were built.

===Coffeehouses===
{{Main|Coffeehouse|English coffeehouses in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries|l2=English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries}}
Coffeehouses were especially important to the spread of knowledge during the Enlightenment because they created a unique environment in which people from many different walks of life gathered and shared ideas. They were frequently criticized by nobles who feared the possibility of an environment in which class and its accompanying titles and privileges were disregarded. Such an environment was especially intimidating to monarchs who derived much of their power from the disparity between classes of people. If classes were to join together under the influence of Enlightenment thinking, they might recognize the all-encompassing oppression and abuses of their monarchs and because of their size might be able to carry out successful revolts. Monarchs also resented the idea of their subjects convening as one to discuss political matters, especially those concerning foreign affairs—rulers thought political affairs to be their business only, a result of their supposed divine right to rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Coffeehouse Civility, 1660–1714: An Aspect of Post-Courtly Culture in England|first=Lawrence E.|journal = Huntington Library Quarterly|last=Klein|date=1 January 1996|volume=59|issue=1|pages=31–51|doi=10.2307/3817904|jstor = 3817904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coffeehouses represent a turning point in history during which people discovered that they could have enjoyable social lives within their communities. Coffeeshops became homes away from home for many who sought, for the first time, to engage in discourse with their neighbors and discuss intriguing and thought-provoking matters, especially those regarding philosophy to politics. Coffeehouses were essential to the Enlightenment, for they were centers of free-thinking and self-discovery. Although many coffeehouse patrons were scholars, a great deal were not. Coffeehouses attracted a diverse set of people, including not only the educated wealthy but also members of the bourgeoisie and the lower class. While it may seem positive that patrons, being doctors, lawyers, merchants, etc. represented almost all classes, the coffeeshop environment sparked fear in those who sought to preserve class distinction. One of the most popular critiques of the coffeehouse claimed that it "allowed promiscuous association among people from different rungs of the social ladder, from the artisan to the aristocrat" and was therefore compared to Noah's Ark, receiving all types of animals, clean or unclean.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; This unique culture served as a catalyst for journalism when [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]] recognized its potential as an audience. Together, Steele and Addison published ''[[The Spectator (1711)]]'', a daily publication which aimed, through fictional narrator Mr. Spectator, both to entertain and to provoke discussion regarding serious philosophical matters.

The first English coffeehouse opened in Oxford in 1650. Brian Cowan said that Oxford coffeehouses developed into "[[penny universities]]", offering a locus of learning that was less formal than structured institutions. These penny universities occupied a significant position in Oxford academic life, as they were frequented by those consequently referred to as the ''virtuosi'', who conducted their research on some of the resulting premises. According to Cowan, "the coffeehouse was a place for like-minded scholars to congregate, to read, as well as learn from and to debate with each other, but was emphatically not a university institution, and the discourse there was of a far different order than any university tutorial".&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 90, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Café Procope]] was established in Paris in 1686 and by the 1720s there were around 400 cafés in the city. The Café Procope in particular became a center of Enlightenment, welcoming such celebrities as Voltaire and Rousseau. The Café Procope was where Diderot and D'Alembert decided to create the ''Encyclopédie''.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, ''Paris: Biography of a City'' (New York: Viking, 2004), 188, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The cafés were one of the various "nerve centers" for ''bruits publics'', public noise or rumour. These ''bruits'' were allegedly a much better source of information than were the actual newspapers available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Darnton |title=An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris |journal=The American Historical Review |year=2000 |volume= 105#1 |issue=1 |pages=1–35 |jstor=2652433|doi=10.2307/2652433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debating societies===
{{Main|London Debating Societies}}
The debating societies are an example of the public sphere during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Donna T. Andrew, "Popular Culture and Public Debate: London 1780", ''This Historical Journal'', Vol. 39, No. 2. (June 1996), pp. 405–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Their origins include:
* Clubs of fifty or more men who, at the beginning of the 18th century, met in pubs to discuss religious issues and affairs of state.
* Mooting clubs, set up by law students to practice rhetoric.
* Spouting clubs, established to help actors train for theatrical roles.
* [[John Henley (clergyman)|John Henley]]'s Oratory, which mixed outrageous sermons with even more absurd questions, like "Whether Scotland be anywhere in the world?".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 406. Andrew gives the name as "William Henley", which must be a lapse of writing.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salon de Madame Geoffrin.jpg|thumb|An example of a French salon]]
In the late 1770s, popular debating societies began to move into more "genteel" rooms, a change which helped establish a new standard of sociability.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 408.&lt;/ref&gt; The backdrop to these developments was "an explosion of interest in the theory and practice of public elocution". The debating societies were commercial enterprises that responded to this demand, sometimes very successfully. Some societies welcomed from 800 to 1,200 spectators a night.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 406–08, 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debating societies discussed an extremely wide range of topics. Before the Enlightenment, most intellectual debates revolved around "confessional"&amp;nbsp;– that is, Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist) or Anglican issues and the main aim of these debates was to establish which bloc of faith ought to have the "monopoly of truth and a God-given title to authority".{{sfn|Israel|2001|p=4}} After this date, everything thus previously rooted in tradition was questioned and often replaced by new concepts in the light of philosophical reason. After the second half of the 17th century and during the 18th century, a "general process of rationalization and secularization set in" and confessional disputes were reduced to a secondary status in favor of the "escalating contest between faith and incredulity".{{sfn|Israel|2001|p=4}}

In addition to debates on religion, societies discussed issues such as politics and the role of women. However, it is important to note that the critical subject matter of these debates did not necessarily translate into opposition to the government. In other words, the results of the debate quite frequently upheld the ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 412–15.&lt;/ref&gt; From a historical standpoint, one of the most important features of the debating society was their openness to the public, as women attended and even participated in almost every debating society, which were likewise open to all classes providing they could pay the entrance fee. Once inside, spectators were able to participate in a largely egalitarian form of sociability that helped spread Enlightenment ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masonic lodges===
[[File:Freimaurer Initiation.jpg|thumb|Masonic initiation ceremony]]

Historians have long debated the extent to which the secret network of [[Freemasonry]] was a main factor in the Enlightenment. The leaders of the Enlightenment included Freemasons such as Diderot, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Lessing, Pope,&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Mack, ''Alexander Pope: A Life'', Yale University Press, 1985 p. 437–40. Pope, a Catholic, was a Freemason in 1730, eight years before membership was prohibited by the Catholic Church (1738). Pope's name is on the membership list of the Goat Tavern Lodge (p. 439). Pope's name appears on a 1723 list and a 1730 list.&lt;/ref&gt; Horace Walpole, Sir Robert Walpole, Mozart, Goethe, Frederick the Great, Benjamin Franklin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.A. Leo Lemay|title=The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 2: Printer and Publisher, 1730–1747|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOhKqgMD10cC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=83–92|isbn=978-0-8122-0929-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bullock | first1 = Steven C. | year = 1996 | title = Initiating the Enlightenment?: Recent Scholarship on European Freemasonry | url = | journal = Eighteenth-Century Life | volume = 20 | issue = 1| page = 81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Davies said that Freemasonry was a powerful force on behalf of [[liberalism]] in Europe from about 1700 to the twentieth century. It expanded rapidly during the Age of Enlightenment, reaching practically every country in Europe. It was especially attractive to powerful aristocrats and politicians as well as intellectuals, artists and political activists.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (1996) pp. 634–35&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Age of Enlightenment, Freemasons comprised an international network of like-minded men, often meeting in secret in ritualistic programs at their lodges. They promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment and helped diffuse these values across Britain and France and other places. Freemasonry as a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals originated in Scotland around 1600 and spread first to England and then across the Continent in the eighteenth century. They fostered new codes of conduct—including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability—"liberty, fraternity and equality".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob's seminal work on Enlightenment freemasonry, Margaret C. Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment: Free masonry and Politics in Eighteenth-Century Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1991) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, "Polite worlds of Enlightenment," in Martin Fitzpatrick and Peter Jones, eds. ''The Enlightenment World'' (Routledge, 2004) pp. 272–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France—by 1789, there were perhaps as many as 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, 436.&lt;/ref&gt; The Freemasons displayed a passion for secrecy and created new degrees and ceremonies. Similar societies, partially imitating Freemasonry, emerged in France, Germany, Sweden and Russia. One example was the [[Illuminati]] founded in Bavaria in 1776, which was copied after the Freemasons, but was never part of the movement. The Illuminati was an overtly political group, which most Masonic lodges decidedly were not.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick and Jones, eds. ''The Enlightenment World'' p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

Masonic lodges created a private model for public affairs. They "reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections and representatives". In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] exiles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, pp. 20, 73, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole. For example, in French lodges the line "As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened" was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to "initiate the unenlightened". This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy. In fact, many lodges praised the Grand Architect, the masonic terminology for the deistic divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, 145–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

German historian Reinhart Koselleck claimed: "On the Continent there were two social structures that left a decisive imprint on the Age of Enlightenment: the Republic of Letters and the Masonic lodges".&lt;ref&gt;Reinhart Koselleck, ''Critique and Crisis'', p. 62, (The MIT Press, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish professor Thomas Munck argues that "although the Masons did promote international and cross-social contacts which were essentially non-religious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values, they can hardly be described as a major radical or reformist network in their own right".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munck, 1994, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Masons values seemed to greatly appeal to Enlightenment values and thinkers. Diderot discusses the link between Freemason ideals and the enlightenment in D'Alembert's Dream, exploring masonry as a way of spreading enlightenment beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/files/Dalemberts_Dream.pdf |last=Diderot |first=Denis |title=D'Alembert's Dream |year=1769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Margaret Jacob stresses the importance of the Masons in indirectly inspiring enlightened political thought.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment: Freemasonry and politics in eighteenth-century Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1991.)&lt;/ref&gt; On the negative side, Daniel Roche contests claims that Masonry promoted egalitarianism and he argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, 437.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of noble women in the French "lodges of adoption" that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic society.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, 139. See also Janet M. Burke, "Freemasonry, Friendship and Noblewomen: The Role of the Secret Society in Bringing Enlightenment Thought to Pre-Revolutionary Women Elites", ''History of European Ideas'' 10 no. 3 (1989): 283–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major opponent of Freemasonry was the Roman Catholic Church so that in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Spain and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between what Davies calls the reactionary Church and enlightened Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (1996) pp. 634–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weisberger et al., eds., ''Freemasonry on both sides of the Atlantic: essays concerning the craft in the British Isles, Europe, the United States, and Mexico'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Even in France, Masons did not act as a group.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: The struggle'' (1970) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; American historians, while noting that Benjamin Franklin and [[George Washington]] were indeed active Masons, have downplayed the importance of Freemasonry in causing the American Revolution because the Masonic order was non-political and included both Patriots and their enemy the Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Neil L. York, "Freemasons and the American Revolution", ''The Historian'' Volume: 55. Issue: 2. 1993, pp. 315+.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
The art produced during the Enlightenment was about a search for morality that was absent from previous art. At the same time, the Classical art of Greece and Rome became interesting to people again, since archaeological teams discovered Pompeii and Herculaneum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Janson|first1=H. W.|last2=Janson|first2=Anthony|title=A Basic History of Art|url = https://archive.org/details/basichistoryofar0006jans |url-access=registration |year=2003|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc. |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/basichistoryofar0006jans/page/458 458–74]}}&lt;/ref&gt; People did take inspiration from it and revived the classical art into neo-classical art. This can be especially seen in early American art, where, throughout their art and architecture, they used arches, goddesses, and other classical architectural designs.

      <text bytes="7750" xml:space="preserve">'''Philosophy of motion''' is a branch of philosophy concerned with exploring questions on the existence and nature of motion. The central questions of this study concern the [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] of motion, whether motion exists as we perceive it, what is it, and, if it exists,  how does it occur. The philosophy of motion is important in the study of theories of change in natural systems and is closely connected to studies of space and time in philosophy.

The philosophy of motion was of central concern to Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers, particularly the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers such as [[Parmenides]], [[Zeno of Elea]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Democritus]].  As such, it was influential in the development of the philosophy of science in general.

==Early history==
===The Greek Physiology===

The concept of motion is closely related to the idea of change, and it is arguments about what made change possible that led the early Greek philosophers to pioneer naturalistic explanations for phenomena.

[[Heraclitus]] (born circa 535 BC) had famously declared that "all things are in motion like a stream".&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, John (1930). Early Greek Philosophy. 4, 5 &amp; 6 Soho Square, London, W.1: A. &amp; C. Black, Ltd. pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Motion only a perception ====
[[Parmenides]] (born circa 475 BC) and his followers held that '''motion is only perceived but cannot actually exist'''. He professed that from our human point of view there are two aspects to the study of the universe of which we must be aware, on the one hand how we see it, and on the other how it must really be. Motion is a fact from our point of view, but Parmenides argues that as far as things must really be, it is logically impossible that motion could exist as we perceive it.

[[Zeno of Elea]], a pupil of Parmenides, formulated the Arguments against motion, more commonly referred to as the [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]], in order to support his masters theories of the One and of the consequent impossibility of motion at the fundamental level. The rigorous denial of even the possibility of motion forced a more thorough response from philosophers engaged on the same theoretical project.

This school of thought leaned on the notion of infinite continuous matter, space (and time). 

====Atomism and Determinism====
In response to Parmenides definition of motion, [[Democritus]] (born circa 460) expounded the [[atomic theory]], in which indivisible bits of matter are in constant motion through the void. In the absence of something to perturb them they fall evenly through space. According to this school of thought matter and or space (and time) are discrete and finite.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1972). A History of Western Philosophy, Simon &amp; Schuster, page 69&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this theory was found by [[John Dalton]] in the early 1800s, explaining the finding that chemical decomposition of compounds gives whole numbered ratios of weight, leading to [[Dalton's atomic theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patterson|first=G.|year=2007 |title=Jean Perrin and the triumph of the atomic doctrine|journal=[[Endeavour (journal)|Endeavour]]|volume=31|issue=2|pages=50–53|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2007.05.003|pmid=17602746}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Motion conceived in this way led to the approach of [[determinism]] and therefore to questioning how [[free will]] could exist. In response, [[Epicurus]] appears to have included the concept of the [[clinamen]], or atomic swerve. This tiny random motion serves to bring atoms into contact and begin the cascade that leads to the organization of matter as it is percieved by us, introducing an element of uncertainty allowing for the existence of individual choice, an essential concept in Epicure's philosophy. 

==== Plato and Aristotle ====
According to [[Plato]] (circa 425 BC), motion is a phenomenon that can never be completely comprehended or described. It originates in infinite and continuous "spiritual" self-motion which is synonimous to life and to the soul. This perpetual motion causes "communicated" motion, which is the perceived motion of bodies.&lt;ref name="Vulemin"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-3244-2_13 The systems of Plato and Aristotle Compared as to their Contributions to Physics], Jules Vulemin, part of  The [[University of Western Ontario]] Series in Philosophy of Science book series (WONS, volume 49)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] (384 BC) claimed that all motion is caused, and can be sensed, but originally was [[Potentiality and actuality|potentially present]] in the now moving body. Once there is motion, that motion will continue infinitely unless it is stopped.&lt;ref name="Vulemin" /&gt; 

Aristotle's doctrine was generally adopted by medieval science and lead to [[Isaac Newton]]'s formulation of the [[Newton's laws of motion]] in 1666.

===Buddhist===
The philosophy of motion is treated by the [[Buddhist]] philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] in his treatise the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] or Fundamental verses of the [[Middle Way]], in the 2nd and 3rd century CE.

Further east, in China, the [[Sanlun]] school of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism developed a sophisticated philosophy of motion under the philosopher [[Sengzhao]]. His treatise called The Immutability of Things, deals with motion explicitly.

===Aztec===
Aztec metaphysics gave priority to motion over substance in its cosmological [[ontology]]. In other words, process was seen to be fundamental and objects or substances as ephemeral. Change therefore was naturally conceived of as motion, and this motion was divided into three forms, out of which all change occurs. These were named olin (bouncing, oscillating) malinalli (spinning, twisting, spiralling) and, the most important, nepantla (weaving, intersecting, joining, balancing).&lt;ref&gt;https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/53017-aztec-philosophy-understanding-a-world-in-motion/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval==

* [[Averroes]]
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]

==Modern==
Achieving a coherent understanding of motion has been, and continues to be, of importance in understanding the nature of space and time in modern science.{{According to whom|date=November 2015}} The main philosophical debate has been between absolute and relational conceptions of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-theories/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum physics===
Questions of the nature of motion continue to arise in modern physics, with many of the issues of concern to early thinkers arising in different form. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the clinamen of the Epicureans.

=== The Philosophy of Movement ===
The philosophy of movement is also a subfield of contemporary philosophy related to [[process philosophy]] and defined by the study of social, aesthetic, scientific, and ontological domains from the perspective of the ''primacy of movement''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nail|first=Thomas|date=2018-06-01|title=The Ontology of Motion|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/qui-parle/article/27/1/47/134792/The-Ontology-of-Motion|journal=Qui Parle|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=47–76|doi=10.1215/10418385-4382983|issn=1041-8385}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes philosophers such as [[Erin Manning (theorist)|Erin Manning]] and [[Thomas Nail]].

'''Thought''' is a [[mind|mental]] process which allows beings to model the world, and so to deal with it effectively according to their goals, plans, ends and desires. Concepts akin to thought are [[cognition]], [[sentience]], [[consciousness]], [[idea]], and [[imagination]].

{{Commons category|Ontology}}

'''Ontology''' is the [[philosophical]] study of the nature of [[being]], [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], [[existence]], or [[reality]], as well as the basic [[category of being|categories of being]] and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as [[metaphysics]], ontology often deals with questions concerning what [[entities]]{{dn|date=October 2019}} exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a [[hierarchy]], and subdivided according to similarities and differences. A very simple definition of ontology is that it is the examination of what is meant, in context, by the word 'thing'.

Articles under this [[Wikipedia:Categorization|category]] are topics which are primarily [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s or [[abstraction]]s. This is to say that they are ''primarily'' ideas, and not some [[physical object]] which can also be "thought of" such as the "idea of a table." These articles are ideas which do not necessarily appear to the mind as an image of an object. For any article in this category structure it can be said that the topic of the article does not exist at any particular time or place, but rather exists generally.

[[File:The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg|thumb|''[[The Blue Marble]]'', a photograph of the planet Earth made on December 7, 1972 by the crew of the [[Apollo 17]] spacecraft]]
[[File:Map of the world by the US Gov as of 2016 no legend.svg|thumb|A [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] [[world map]] of shorelines and national borders as of 2016 under the [[Robinson projection]]]]

The '''World''' is the [[Earth]] and all [[life]] on it, including [[civilization|human civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world Merriam-webster.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423111522/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world |date=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a philosophical context, the "world" is the whole of the physical [[Universe]], or an [[ontology|ontological]] world (the "world" of an [[individual]]). In a theological context, the ''world'' is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres. "[[Eschatology|End of the world]]" scenarios refer to the end of human history, often in religious contexts.

The [[history of the World]] is commonly understood as the history of humanity spanning the major geopolitical developments of about five millennia, from the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] to the present. In terms such as [[world religion]], [[world language]], [[world government]], and [[world war]], the term ''world'' suggests an international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of every part of the world.

The [[world population]] is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, the [[world economy]] is the sum of the economies of all societies or countries, especially in the context of [[globalization]]. Terms such as "[[world championship]]", "[[gross world product]]", and "[[world flags]]" imply the sum or combination of all [[sovereign state]]s.

==Etymology and usage==
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld)'', a compound of ''[[were|wer]]'' "man" and ''eld'' "age," which thus means roughly "Age of Man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html ''American Heritage Dictionary'' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512075921/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Old English is a reflex of the [[Common Germanic]] ''*wira-alđiz'', also reflected in [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old Dutch]] ''werilt'', [[Old High German]] ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''verǫld'' (whence the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''[[wikt:en:veröld|veröld]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir (2003). ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology'' Leiden: Brill. pg. 462. {{ISBN|90-04-12875-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The corresponding word in [[Latin]] is ''mundus'', literally "clean, elegant", itself a loan translation of Greek ''[[cosmos]]'' "orderly arrangement." While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a "domain of Man" (compare [[Midgard]]), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the [[chthonic]] sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of [[creation myth|creation]] as an act of establishing order out of [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].

"World" distinguishes the entire [[planet]] or [[population]] from any particular [[country]] or [[region]]: ''world affairs'' pertain not just to one place but to the whole world, and ''[[world history]]'' is a field of [[history]] that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective. ''Earth'', on the other hand, refers to the planet as a physical entity, and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects.

"World" was also classically used to mean the material universe, or the cosmos: "The worlde is an apte frame of heauen and earthe, and all other naturall thinges contained in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R|last=Record|year=1556|title=Castle of Knowledge}} cited in {{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|at=World, sense 8|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230262?rskey=BRZMwD|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earth was often described as "the center of the world".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book|author=Sacrobosco|title=Treatise on the Sphere|year=1230|at=trans by Lynn Thorndike, 1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519151919/http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|archivedate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be used attributively, to mean "global", or "relating to the whole world", forming usages such as [[world community]] or world canonical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawpark.jimdo.com''World Canonical Texts'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, a ''world'' may refer to any planet or [[heavenly body]], especially when it is thought of as inhabited, especially in the context of [[science fiction]] or [[futurology]].

''World'', in its original sense, when qualified, can also refer to a particular domain of [[human]] [[experience]].

* The ''world of work'' describes paid work and the pursuit of a [[career]], in all its social aspects, to distinguish it from home life and [[academia|academic]] study.
* The ''fashion world'' describes the environment of the designers, [[fashion house]]s and [[consumer]]s that make up the [[fashion industry]].
* historically, the ''[[New World]]'' vs. the ''[[Old World]]'', referring to the parts of the world colonized in the wake of the [[age of discovery]]. Now mostly used in zoology and botany, as in [[New World monkey]].

==Philosophy==
[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' triptych by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] ({{Circa|1503}}) shows the "garden" of mundane pleasures flanked by [[Paradise]] and [[Hell]]. 

The exterior panel shows the world before the appearance of humanity, depicted as a [[flat earth|disc]] enclosed in a [[firmament|sphere]].]]

In philosophy, the term ''world'' has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up [[reality]] or the physical [[universe]]. In others, it can mean have a specific [[ontology|ontological]] sense (see [[world disclosure]]). While clarifying the [[concept]] of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of [[Western philosophy]], this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heidegger |first=Martin |title=Basic Problems of Phenomenology |location=Bloomington |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1982 |page=[https://archive.org/details/basicproblemsofp00mart/page/165 165] |isbn=0-253-17686-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/basicproblemsofp00mart/page/165 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.

===Parmenides===
The traditional interpretation of [[Parmenides]]' work is that he argued that the everyday perception of reality of the physical world (as described in ''[[Parmenides#The Way of Opinion (doxa)|doxa]]'') is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.

===Plato===
In his [[Allegory of the Cave]], [[Plato]] distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world.

===Hegel===
In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s [[philosophy of history]], the expression ''Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht'' (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.

===Schopenhauer===
''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' is the central work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].
Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.

===Wittgenstein===
Two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. "The world is everything that is the case," wrote [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his influential ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', first published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=3 December 2017|first1=Anat|first2=Anat|last1=Biletzki|last2=Matar|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition would serve as the basis of [[logical positivism]], with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.

===Heidegger===
[[Martin Heidegger]], meanwhile, argued that "the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world".&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1982), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already "thrown" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of "[[world disclosure]]" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work ''[[Being and Time]]''.

===Freud===
In response, [[Sigmund Freud]] proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.

===Others===
Some philosophers, often inspired by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability, and necessity are best analyzed by comparing ''the'' world to a range of [[possible world]]s; a view commonly known as [[modal realism]].

==Religion==
[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Yggdrasil]], a modern attempt to reconstruct the Norse [[world tree]] which connects the [[heaven]]s, the world, and the [[underworld]].]]

[[Mythological cosmology|Mythological cosmologies]] often depict the world as centered on an ''[[axis mundi]]'' and delimited by a boundary such as a [[Oceanus|world ocean]], a [[Jörmungandr|world serpent]] or similar. In some religions, worldliness (also called carnality)&lt;ref&gt;Hemer, C. J. “Worldly.” Edited by Geoffrey W. Bromiley. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised. Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979–1988.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary Online|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=OED Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that which relates to this world as opposed to other worlds or realms.

===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism]], the world means society, as distinct from the [[monastery]]. It refers to the material world, and to worldly gain such as wealth, reputation, jobs, and war. The spiritual world would be the path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and changes would be sought in what we could call the psychological realm.

===Christianity===
In [[Christianity]], the term often connotes the concept of the [[fall of man|fallen]] and corrupt world order of human society, in contrast to the [[World to Come]]. The world is frequently cited alongside ''the [[flesh (theology)|flesh]]'' and ''the [[Devil]]'' as a source of [[temptation]] that Christians should flee. [[Monk]]s speak of striving to be "''in'' this world, but not ''of'' this world"—as [[Jesus]] said—and the term "worldhood" has been distinguished from "monkhood", the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with "worldly" things.

This view is clearly expressed by king [[Alfred the Great]] of England (d. 899) in his famous Preface to the ''[[Cura Pastoralis]]'':
{{quote|"Therefore I command you to do as I believe you are willing to do, that you free yourself from worldly affairs ''([[Old English]]: woruldðinga)'' as often as you can, so that wherever you can establish that wisdom that God gave you, you establish it. Consider what punishments befell us in this world when we neither loved wisdom at all ourselves, nor transmitted it to other men; we had the name alone that we were Christians, and very few had the practices."}}

Although Hebrew and Greek words meaning "world" are used in Scripture with the normal variety of senses, many examples of its use in this particular sense can be found in the teachings of [[Jesus]] according to the [[Gospel of John]], e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36. In contrast, a relatively newer concept is [[Catholic imagination]].

''[[Contemptus mundi]]'' is the name given to the recognition that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm Contemptus mundi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140237/http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been criticized as a "pastoral of fear" by modern historian [[Jean Delumeau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm Parish Missions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605035017/http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Vatican Council]], there was a novel attempt to develop a positive theological view of the World, which is illustrated by the pastoral optimism of the constitutions ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', ''[[Unitatis redintegratio]]'' and ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]''.

====Eastern Christianity====
In Eastern Christian monasticism or [[asceticism]], the world of mankind is driven by passions. Therefore, the passions of the World are simply called "the world". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation ([[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]). The process of theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by Eastern Christians, the [[Philokalia]] and the [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]] (the works of Evagrius and [[John Climacus]] are also contained within the Philokalia). At the highest level of world [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] is [[hesychasm]] which culminates into the [[theoria|Vision of God]].

====Orbis Catholicus====
''Orbis Catholicus'' is a Latin phrase meaning ''Catholic world'', per the expression [[Urbi et Orbi]], and refers to that area of [[Christendom]] under [[papal supremacy]]. It is somewhat similar to the phrases secular world, Jewish world and [[Islamic world]].

===Islam===
{{Main|Dunya}}
''Dunya'' derives from the root word "dana" that means to bring near. In that sense, "dunya" is "what is brought near".&lt;ref&gt;Attas, Islam and Secularism, p.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

===Hinduism===
[[Hinduism]] is an [[Indian religion]] and ''[[dharma]]'', or a way of life, widely practised in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It includes a number of Indian religious traditions with a loose sense of interconnection, as different from Jainism and Buddhism, and (since medieval and modern times) Islam and Christianity. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world.{{refn|group=note|See:

[[Image:solitude.jpg|thumb|Nature contemplation]]

Whilst in the life of the [[intellect]] 'contemplation' refers to thinking profoundly about something, in the religious life '''contemplation''' is a kind of inner vision or seeing, [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] of the intellect, facilitated by means of practices such as [[contemplative prayer|prayer]] or [[meditation]].

==Definition==

The word contemplation basically means 'to think about an action before you perform it'.

==Etymology==
The word ''contemplation'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''contemplatio'', ultimately from the Latin word ''templum'', a piece of ground consecrated for the taking of auspices, or a building for worship. The latter either derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root  ''*tem-'' ("to cut"), on notion of "place reserved or cut out", or from the root *''temp''- ("to stretch, string"), thus referring to a cleared (measured) space in front of an altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=temple|title=temple {{!}} Search Online Etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=Etymonline|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vaan|first=Michiel de|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecZ1DwAAQBAJ|title=Etymological Dictionary of Latin and the other Italic Languages|date=2018|publisher=Brill|year=|isbn=978-90-04-16797-1|location=|pages=610–611|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''contemplatio'' was used to translate the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''θεωρία'' (''[[theoria|theōría]]'').

==Greek philosophy==

Contemplation was an important part of the [[philosophy]] of [[Plato]]; Plato thought that through contemplation, the soul may ascend to knowledge of the [[Form of the Good]] or other divine Forms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=veWc15Cd9L4C&amp;pg=PA156 ''Plato: Critical Assessments''], Nicholas D. Smith, Routledge, 1998. {{ISBN|0-415-12605-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plotinus]] as a [[neoplatonism|(neo)Platonic]] philosopher also expressed contemplation as the most critical of components for one to reach [[henosis]]. 
To Plotinus the highest contemplation was to experience the vision of God, the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] or the One. Plotinus describes this experience in his works the [[Enneads]]. According to his student Porphyry, Plotinus stated that he had this experience of God four times.&lt;ref&gt;See the Life of Plotinus&lt;/ref&gt; Plotinus wrote about his experience in Enneads 6.9.

[[Baha'u'llah]] and [[Abdu'l-Baha]] wrote about contemplation and meditation in regards to reflecting on beauty, the Kingdom of God, science, and the arts.  Abdu'l-Baha stated that "the sign of the intellect is contemplation and the sign of contemplation is silence... he cannot both speak and meditate".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahai.org/r/359367592&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Christian meditation|Theoria}}

In [[Eastern Christianity]], contemplation ([[theoria]]) literally means to see God or to have the Vision of God.{{refn|group=note|Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos: "The vision of the uncreated light, which offers knowledge of God to man, is sensory and supra-sensory. The bodily eyes are reshaped, so they see the uncreated light, "this mysterious light, inaccessible, immaterial, uncreated, deifying, eternal", this "radiance of the Divine Nature, this glory of the divinity, this beauty of the heavenly kingdom" (3,1,22;CWS p.80). Palamas asks: "Do you see that light is inaccessible to senses which are not transformed by the Spirit?" (2,3,22). St. Maximus, whose teaching is cited by St. Gregory, says that the Apostles saw the uncreated Light "by a transformation of the activity of their senses, produced in them by the Spirit" (2.3.22).&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos (2005), ''Orthodox Psychotherapy'', section ''The Knowledge of God according to St. Gregory Palamas''. Birth of Theotokos Monastery, Greece, {{ISBN|978-960-7070-27-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The state of beholding God, or union with God, is known as theoria. The process of [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Theosis]] which leads to that state of union with God known as theoria is practiced in the [[ascetic]] tradition of [[Hesychasm]]. Hesychasm is to reconcile the heart and the mind into one thing (see [[nous]]).{{refn|group=note|pelagia.org: "Stillness of the body is a limiting of the body. 'The beginning of hesychia is godly rest' (3). The intermediate stage is that of 'illuminating power and vision; and the end is ecstasy or rapture of the nous towards God' (4). St. John of the Ladder, referring to outward, bodily stillness, writes: 'The lover of stillness keeps his mouth shut' (5). But it is not only those called neptic Fathers who mention and describe the holy atmosphere of hesychia, it is also those known as 'social'. Actually in the Orthodox tradition there is no direct opposition between theoria and praxis, nor between the neptic and social Fathers. The neptics are eminently social and those in community are unimaginably neptic."&lt;ref&gt;pelagia.org, [http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b02.en.orthodox_psychotherapy.05.htm ''Orthodox Psychotherapy''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102175616/http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b02.en.orthodox_psychotherapy.05.htm |date=2012-01-02 }},  section on ''Stillness and Prayer''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Contemplation in Eastern Orthodoxy is expressed in degrees as those covered in St [[John Climacus]]' [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]]. The process of changing from the old man of sin into the newborn child of God and into our true nature as good and divine is called [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Theosis]].

This is to say that once someone is in the presence of God, deified with him, then they can begin to properly understand, and there "contemplate" God. This form of contemplation is to have and pass through an actual experience rather than a rational or reasoned understanding of theory (see [[Gnosis]]). Whereas with rational thought one uses logic to understand, one does the opposite with God (see also [[Apophatic theology]]).

The anonymously authored 14th century English contemplative work ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' makes clear that its form of practice is not an act of the intellect, but a kind of transcendent ‘seeing,’ beyond the usual activities of the mind - “The first time you practice contemplation, you'll experience a darkness, like a cloud of unknowing. You won't know what this is... this darkness and this cloud will always be between you and your God... they will always keep you from seeing him clearly by the light of understanding in your intellect and will block you from feeling Him fully in the sweetness of love in your emotions. So be sure to make your home in this darkness... We can't think our way to God... that's why I'm willing to abandon everything I know, to love the one thing I cannot think. He can be loved, but not thought.”&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from the Shambhala edition, translated by Carmen Acevedo Butcher [https://www.calameo.com/read/00003925753940ebf2aba&amp;#x20;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Western [[Christianity]] contemplation is often related to [[Mystical theology|mysticism]] as expressed in the works of [[Mystical theology|mystical theologians]] such as [[Teresa of Avila]] and [[John of the Cross]] as well as the writings of [[Margery Kempe]], [[Augustine Baker]] and [[Thomas Merton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04324b.htm "Contemplation"], ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', New Advent. Retrieved March 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dom [[Edward Cuthbert Butler|Cuthbert Butler]] notes that contemplation was the term used in the Latin Church to refer to mysticism, and "'mysticism' is a quite modern word".&lt;ref&gt; ''Western Mysticism: Augustine, Gregory and Bernard on Contemplation and the Contemplative Life'', by Dom Cuthbert Butler. Dover: Mineola, NY, 2003, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation===
In Christianity, contemplation refers to a content-free mind directed towards the awareness of [[God]] as a living reality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} This corresponds, in some ways, to what in Eastern religion is called [[samadhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/pali/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/Digha1/02-samannaphala-e2.htm], samannaphala sutta Digha-Nikaya-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/Vedic/jhananandaysutra.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504200949/http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/vedic/jhananandaysutra.htm |archivedate=2011-05-04 }}, Patanjali, Yoga Sutras&lt;/ref&gt; Meditation, on the other hand, for many centuries in the Western Church, referred to more cognitively active exercises, such as visualizations of Biblical scenes as in the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Ignatian exercises]] or ''[[lectio divina]]'' in which the practitioner "listens to the text of the Bible with the 'ear of the heart', as if he or she is in conversation with God, and God is suggesting the topics for discussion." &lt;ref&gt;A contemporary discussion of differences between ''meditatio'' and ''contemplatio'' is available in Father Thomas Keating's book on contemplative centering prayer, ''Open Mind, Open Heart: The Contemplative Dimension of the Gospel'' (1986) {{ISBN|0-8264-0696-3}}. Brief descriptions of centering prayer and ''lectio divina'' are available online at http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Catholic Christianity, contemplation is given importance. The Catholic Church's "model theologian", St. Thomas Aquinas wrote: "It is requisite for the good of the human community that there should be persons who devote themselves to the life of contemplation." One of his disciples, [[Josef Pieper]] commented: "For it is contemplation which preserves in the midst of human society the truth which is at one and the same time useless and the yardstick of every possible use; so it is also contemplation which keeps the true end in sight, gives meaning to every practical act of life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zenit.org/article-21671?l=english "Says Pope a Universal Voice for the World"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205004758/http://www.zenit.org/article-21671?l=english |date=2008-02-05 }}, Carrie Gross, February 1, 2008, Zenit.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope John Paul II in the Apostolic Letter "Rosarium Virginis Mariae" referred specifically to the catholic devotion of the [[Rosary|Holy Rosary]] as "an exquisitely contemplative prayer" and said that "By its nature the recitation of the Rosary calls for a quiet rhythm and a lingering pace, helping the individual to meditate on the mysteries of the Lord's life as seen through the eyes of her who was closest to the Lord. In this way the unfathomable riches of these mysteries are disclosed.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis-mariae.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aquinas, the highest form of life is the contemplative which communicates the fruits of contemplation to others, since it is based on the abundance of contemplation (''contemplari et contemplata aliis tradere'') ([[Summa Theologiae|ST]], III, Q. 40, A. 1, Ad 2).

'''Truth''' is most often used to mean being in accord with [[fact]] or [[reality]], or fidelity to an original or standard.&lt;ref name = Merriam-Webster-def&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, [http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth truth], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Truth is also sometimes defined in [[modernity|modern]] contexts as an idea of "truth to self", or [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

Truth is usually held to be [[principle of bivalence|opposite]] to [[Falsity|falsehood]], which, correspondingly, can also suggest a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The [[concept]] of truth is discussed and [[debate]]d in several contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the [[science]]s, [[law]], [[journalism]], and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. To some, truth is viewed as the correspondence of [[language]] or [[thought]] to an independent [[reality]], in what is sometimes called the [[correspondence theory of truth]].

Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians.&lt;ref name=PUP32014&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexis G. Burgess and John P. Burgess|title=Truth|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-14401-6|edition=1st|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9460.html|accessdate=October 4, 2014|format=hardcover|quote=a concise introduction to current philosophical debates about truth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language is a means by which humans convey [[information]] to one another. The method used to determine whether something is a truth is termed a [[criteria of truth|criterion of truth]]. There are varying stances on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are [[truthbearer]]s capable of being true or false; how to define, identify, and distinguish truth; what roles do faith and empirical knowledge play; and whether truth can be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] or if it is [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] (in other words, [[knowledge relativity|relative truth]] versus [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute truth]]).

[[File:An angel carrying the banner of "Truth", Roslin, Midlothian.JPG|thumb|left|An angel carrying the banner of "Truth", [[Roslin, Midlothian]]]]
The English word ''[[:wikt:truth|truth]]'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ'', [[Middle English]] ''trewþe'', cognate to [[Old High German]] ''triuwida'', [[Old Norse]] ''tryggð''. Like ''[[Troth (disambiguation)|troth]]'', it is a ''[[:wikt:-th|-th]]'' nominalisation of the adjective ''true'' (Old English ''tréowe'').

The English word ''[[:wikt:true|true]]'' is from Old English ([[West Sexaon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]]) ''(ge)tríewe, [[:wikt:treowe|tréowe]]'', cognate to [[Old Saxon]] ''(gi)trûui'', [[Old High German]] ''(ga)triuwu'' ([[Modern German]] ''treu'' "faithful"), [[Old Norse]] ''tryggr'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''triggws'',&lt;ref&gt;see [[Holtzmann's law]] for the ''-ww-'' : ''-gg-'' alternation.&lt;/ref&gt; all from a [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*trewwj-'' "having [[good faith]]", perhaps ultimately from PIE *dru- "tree", on the notion of "steadfast as an oak" (e.g., Sanskrit "taru" tree).&lt;ref name="Truth from Online Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Etymology|first=Online|title=Online Etymology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Old Norse ''{{lang|is|trú}}'', "faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h442.php A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic]'', Geir T. Zoëga (1910), Northvegr.org&lt;/ref&gt; (archaic English ''[[:wikt:troth|troth]]'' "loyalty, honesty, good faith", compare ''{{lang|is|[[wikt:Ásatrú|Ásatrú]]}}'').

Thus, 'truth' involves both the quality of "faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity",&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] on ''true'' has "Steadfast in adherence to a commander or friend, to a principle or cause, to one's promises, faith, etc.; firm in allegiance; faithful, loyal, constant, trusty; Honest, honourable, upright, virtuous, trustworthy; free from deceit, sincere, truthful " besides "Conformity with fact; agreement with reality; accuracy, correctness, verity; Consistent with fact; agreeing with the reality; representing the thing as it is; Real, genuine; rightly answering to the description; properly so called; not counterfeit, spurious, or imaginary."&lt;/ref&gt; and that of "agreement with [[fact]] or [[reality]]", in Anglo-Saxon expressed by ''[[:wikt:sōþ|sōþ]]'' (Modern English ''[[:wikt:sooth|sooth]]'').

All Germanic languages besides English have introduced a terminological distinction between truth "fidelity" and truth "factuality". To express "factuality", [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] opted for nouns derived from ''sanna'' "to assert, affirm", while continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] (German and Dutch) opted for continuations of ''wâra'' "faith, trust, pact" (cognate to Slavic ''věra'' "(religious) faith", but influenced by Latin ''[[veritas|verus]]''). [[Romance language]]s use terms following the Latin ''[[veritas]]'', while the Greek ''[[aletheia]]'', Russian ''[[:wikt:pravda|pravda]]'', South Slavic ''istina'' and Sanskrit ''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|sat]]'' have separate etymological origins.

The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered true, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive '''theories of truth'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; listed below. Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.&lt;ref name="EPT"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Supp., "Truth", auth: Michael Williams, pp. 572–73 (Macmillan, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'', Oxford University Press, Oxford. Includes papers by James, Ramsey, Russell, Tarski, and more recent work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-last = Hale | editor1-first = Bob| editor2-first = Crispin | doi = 10.1111/b.9780631213260.1999.00015.x | pages = 309–30 | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-631-21326-0 | pmid =  | pmc = | editor2-last = Wright | title = A Companion to the Philosophy of Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories other than the most prevalent substantive theories are also discussed. More recently developed "[[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]]" or "minimalist" theories of truth have emerged as possible alternatives to the most prevalent substantive theories. Minimalist reasoning centres around the notion that the application of a term like ''true'' to a statement does not assert anything significant about it, for instance, anything about its ''nature''. Minimalist reasoning realises ''truth'' as a label utilised in general discourse to express agreement, to stress claims, or to form general assumptions.&lt;ref name = EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horwich, Paul, ''Truth'', (2nd edition, 1988),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, ''Truth and the Absence of Fact'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Correspondence====
{{Main|Correspondence theory of truth}}
Correspondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: [[Arthur N. Prior]], p. 223 (Macmillan, 1969). Prior uses [[Bertrand Russell]]'s wording in defining correspondence theory. According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223–24 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to "things" by whether it accurately describes those "things". A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: "[[Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus]]" ("Truth is the adequation of things and [[intellect]]"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century [[Neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, Macmillan, 1969, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16, A.2 arg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also restated the theory as: "A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] (citing ''De Veritate'' Q.1, A.1–3 and ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as "[[objective reality]]" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Bradley, F.H., "On Truth and Copying", in Blackburn, ''et al.'' (eds., 1999),''Truth'', 31–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on "Moore's Correspondence Theory", 225–26, "Russell's Correspondence Theory", 226–27, "Remsey and Later Wittgenstein", 228–29, "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may "know" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in [[agglutinative languages]]). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate [[truth predicate]]. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is [[Alfred Tarski]], whose [[semantic theory of truth|semantic theory]] is summarized further below in this article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See the section on "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis, such as interpersonal power struggles, community interactions, personal biases and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth.

====Coherence====
{{Main|Coherence theory of truth}}
[[File:Statue of Truth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Veritas'' (Truth) outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]

For coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity and usefulness continues to be debated even today. Similarly, the systems of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Spinoza]] are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity.&lt;/ref&gt;  A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole.  Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.

Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of [[formal system]]s in logic and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 130–31 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate [[independence (mathematical logic)|axiomatically independent]] and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various [[noneuclidean geometry|alternative geometries]]. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the [[Natural environment|natural world]], [[empirical]] data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 131–33, ''see'' esp., section on "Epistemological assumptions" (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Coherence theories distinguish the thought of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers, particularly of [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], along with the British philosopher [[F. H. Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of [[logical positivism]], notably [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Carl Hempel]].

====Pragmatic====
{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}

The three most influential forms of the ''pragmatic theory of truth'' were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].  Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 5, "Pragmatic Theory of Truth", 427 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] defines truth as follows:  "Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth."&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 716–20 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled "''Logical''", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials "(C.S.P.)", see Google Books [https://archive.org/details/beginningthirdr00randgoog/page/n748 &lt;!-- pg=718 --&gt; Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and "reference to the future", are essential to a proper conception of truth.  Although Peirce uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he accords a lower status than ''real'' definitions.

[[William James]]'s version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that "the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving."&lt;ref name=WJP&gt;James, William, ''The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism','' (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;  By this, James meant that truth is a ''quality'', the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, "pragmatic").

[[John Dewey]], less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that [[inquiry]], whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Dewey, John", auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p. 383 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by [[William Ernest Hocking]], this variation is known as "negative pragmatism".  Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, W.S. &amp; Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1966, {{LCCN|66-23155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Feynman]] also ascribed to it: "We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong."&lt;ref name="FeynmanThe"&gt;Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, New York: Random House, 1994, {{ISBN|0-679-60127-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey.  For Peirce, the idea of "... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ..." fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing.  As Feynman noted, an idea or theory "... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right."&lt;ref name="FeynmanThe" /&gt;  Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is "self-corrective" over time.

Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience.  The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity.  As Feynman said, "... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constructivist====
{{Main|Constructivist epistemology}}

[[Constructivist epistemology|Social constructivism]] holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as "constructed," because it does not reflect any external "transcendent" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold).  Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], are socially constructed.

[[Giambattista Vico]] was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico's [[epistemology|epistemological]] orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom—''verum ipsum factum''—"truth itself is constructed". [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is "in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history" and ideological knowledge is "an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=May, Todd |authorlink1=Todd May |title=Between Genealogy and Epistemology: Psychology, Politics, and Knowledge in the Thought of Michel Foucault |date=1993 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |location=University Park |isbn=978-0271027821|oclc= 26553016|page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2019}}

====Consensus====
{{Main|Consensus theory of truth}}

[[Consensus theory of truth|Consensus theory]] holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a [[subset]] thereof consisting of more than one person.

Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of "truth" is the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an [[ideal speech situation]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972), esp. Part III, pp. 187 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, Nicholas, ''Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Islamic tradition, this principle is exemplified by the [[hadith]] in which [[Muhammad]] states, "My [[ummah|community]] will never agree upon an error"&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by [http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/33/10 al-Tirmidhi (4:2167)], ibn Majah (2:1303), Abu Dawood, and others with slightly different wordings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist===
====Deflationary====
{{Main|Deflationary theory of truth}}

Modern developments in the field of philosophy, starting with the relatively modern notion that a theory being old does not necessarily imply that it is completely flawless, have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term ''truth'' does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of ''truth predicates'' (e.g., that some particular thing "...is true") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century.  From this point of view, to assert that "'2 + 2 = 4' is true" is logically equivalent to asserting that "2 + 2 = 4", and the phrase "is true" is completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilise a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true. Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account and work with sentence structures that are actually employed in common discourse can be broadly described:
* as ''deflationary'' theories of truth, since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words "true" or ''truth'',
* as ''disquotational'' theories, to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example, or
* as ''minimalist'' theories of truth.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'' in the Introductory section of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that "[t]he predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis."&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt; Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it ''does'' appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., [[Semantic paradox]]es, and below.)

In addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate "is true", some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences. For example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence:
:''Michael says, 'snow is white' and snow is white, or he says 'roses are red' and roses are red or he says ... etc.''
This assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying: ''What Michael says is true''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Kirkham]], [[Theories of Truth: A Critical Introduction]], MIT Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performative====
Attributed to [[P. F. Strawson]] is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say "'Snow is white' is true" is to perform the [[speech act]] of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the wedding couple say "I do" at the appropriate time in a wedding, they are performing the act of taking the other to be their lawful wedded spouse. They are not ''describing'' themselves as taking the other, but actually ''doing'' so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such "illocutionary acts" is [[J. L. Austin]], "[[How to Do Things With Words]]"&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Austin, "How to Do Things With Words". Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;).

Strawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: "To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement.  When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.'  The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 6: ''Performative Theory of Truth'', auth: Gertrude Ezorsky, p. 88 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Redundancy and related====
{{Main|Redundancy theory of truth}}

According to the [[redundancy theory of truth]], asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself.  For example, making the assertion that "&amp;nbsp;'Snow is white' is true" is equivalent to asserting "Snow is white".  Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality.  This theory is commonly attributed to [[Frank P. Ramsey]], who held that the use of words like ''fact'' and ''truth'' was nothing but a [[periphrasis|roundabout]] way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a "linguistic muddle".&lt;ref name="EPT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, F.P. (1927), "Facts and Propositions", Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume 7, 153–70. Reprinted, pp. 34–51 in F.P. Ramsey, Philosophical Papers, David Hugh Mellor (ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Morvan, Pierre. (2004) "Ramsey on Truth and Truth on Ramsey", ''The British Journal for the History of Philosophy'' 12(4), pp. 705–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory which uses a modified form of [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]'s [[Truth#Semantic theory of truth|schema]]: To say that '"P" is true' is to say that P.  A version of this theory was defended by [[C. J. F. Williams]] in his book ''What is Truth?''  Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and [[Nuel Belnap]] as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims.  They argue that sentences like "That's true", when said in response to "It's raining", are [[prosentence]]s, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions.  In the same way that ''it'' means the same as ''my dog'' in the sentence ''My dog was hungry, so I fed it'', ''That's true'' is supposed to mean the same as ''It's raining''—if you say the latter and I then say the former.  These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is ''not'' a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion "P" may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as "that's true."&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;

Deflationary principles do not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences, and also do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise.  Consider the analogy between the sentence "Snow is white" and the character named Snow White, both of which can be true in some sense.  To a minimalist, saying "Snow is white is true" is the same as saying "Snow is white," but to say "Snow White is true" is ''not'' the same as saying "Snow White."

====Philosophical skepticism====
{{see also|Philosophical skepticism|Certainty}}

[[Philosophical skepticism]] is generally any questioning attitude or [[doubt]] towards one or more items of [[knowledge]] or [[belief]] which ascribe truth to their assertions and propositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. H. |last=Popkin |title=The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes (rev. ed. 1968); C. L. Stough, Greek Skepticism (1969); M. Burnyeat, ed., The Skeptical Tradition (1983); B. Stroud, The Significance of Philosophical Skepticism (1984) |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Skeptikoi |work=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophical views are typically classed as skeptical when they involve advancing some degree of doubt regarding claims that are elsewhere taken for granted." [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/s/skepcont.htm utm.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The primary target of philosophical skepticism is [[epistemology]], but it can be applied to any domain, such as the [[supernatural]], morality ([[moral skepticism]]), and [[religious skepticism|religion]] (skepticism about the existence of God).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Handbook of Skepticism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ozv0lftrUeEC|publisher = Oxford University Press, US|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-518321-4|language = en|first = John|last = Greco|authorlink=John Greco (philosopher)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Philosophical skepticism comes in various forms. [[Radical skepticism|Radical forms of skepticism]] deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to [[epoche|suspend judgment]] regarding ascription of truth on many or all controversial matters. More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about the "big questions" in life, such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife. [[Religious skepticism]] is "doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality, providence, and revelation)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of SKEPTICISM|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skepticism|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific skepticism]] concerns testing beliefs for reliability, by subjecting them to [[wikt:systematic|systematic]] investigation using the [[scientific method]], to discover [[empirical evidence]] for them.

===Pluralist===
{{Main|Pluralist theories of truth}}
Several of the major theories of truth hold that there is a particular property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true: ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence. Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about.

Some of the pragmatic theories, such as those by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]] and [[William James]], included aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories.&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WJP/&gt; [[Crispin Wright]] argued in his 1992 book ''Truth and Objectivity'' that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility.&lt;ref&gt;Truth and Objectivity, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Lynch (philosopher)|Michael Lynch]], in a 2009 book ''Truth as One and Many'', argued that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.&lt;ref&gt;Truth as One and Many (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most-believed===
According to a survey of professional philosophers and others on their philosophical views which was carried out in November 2009 (taken by 3226 respondents, including 1803 philosophy faculty members and/or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students) 45% of respondents accept or lean towards correspondence theories, 21% accept or lean towards deflationary theories and 14% [[Epistemic theories of truth|epistemic theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl?affil=All+respondents&amp;areas0=0&amp;areas_max=1&amp;grain=medium |title=The PhilPapers Surveys – Preliminary Survey results |website=The PhilPapers Surveys |publisher=Philpapers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal theories==

===Logic===
{{Main|Logical truth|Criteria of truth|Truth value}}

[[Logic]] is concerned with the patterns in [[reason]] that can help tell us if a [[proposition]] is true or not. Logicians use [[formal language]]s to express the truths which they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] or truth within some [[logical system]].

A logical truth (also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth) is a statement which is true in all possible worlds&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a ''[[fact]]'' (also called a ''[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic claim]]'' or a ''[[Necessary and sufficient condition|contingency]]'') which is only true in this [[World (philosophy)|world]] as it has historically unfolded. A proposition such as "If p and q, then p" is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[well-formed formula|words]] in it and not because of any fact of any particular world. They are such that they could not be untrue.

[[Degree of truth|Degrees]] of [[truth values|truth]] in logic may be represented using two or more discrete values, as with [[principle of bivalence|bivalent logic]] (or [[Boolean logic|binary logic]]), [[three-valued logic]], and other forms of [[finite-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kretzmann| first=Norman| title=William of Sherwood's Treatise on Syncategorematic Words| chapter=IV, section&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;2.

===Mathematics===
{{anchor|Truth_in_mathematics}} 
{{Main|Model theory|Proof theory}}

There are two main approaches to truth in mathematics.  They are the ''[[model theory|model theory of truth]]'' and the ''[[proof theory|proof theory of truth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Maddy; ''Realism in Mathematics''; Series: Clarendon Paperbacks; Paperback: 216 pages; Publisher: Oxford University Press, US (1992); {{ISBN|0-19-824035-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, with the nineteenth century development of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] mathematical models of logic began to treat "truth", also represented as "T" or "1", as an arbitrary constant.  "Falsity" is also an arbitrary constant, which can be represented as "F" or "0".  In [[propositional logic]], these symbols can be manipulated according to a set of [[axioms]] and [[rules of inference]], often given in the form of [[truth table]]s.

In addition, from at least the time of [[Hilbert's program]] at the turn of the twentieth century to the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and the development of the [[Church–Turing thesis]] in the early part of that century, true statements in mathematics were [[logical positivism|generally assumed]] to be those statements that are provable in a formal axiomatic system.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott Mendelson; ''Introduction to Mathematical Logic''; Series: Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications; Hardcover: 469 pages; Publisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 5 edition (August 11, 2009); {{ISBN|1-58488-876-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], and others shook this assumption, with the development of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Chaitin, Gregory L., ''The Limits of Mathematics'' (1997) esp. 89 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of the latter can be found in [[Hilbert's problems]]. Work on [[Hilbert's 10th problem]] led in the late twentieth century to the construction of specific [[Diophantine equations]] for which it is undecidable whether they have a solution,&lt;ref&gt;M.

More fundamentally, [[Hilbert's first problem]] was on the [[continuum hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Benjamin H.. ''The Honors Class. Hilbert's Problems and Their Solvers'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard [[axiom]]s of [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, Gregory L., ''The Limits of Mathematics'' (1997) 1–28, 89 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of some, then, it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom.

Reconsidered assumptions about the essence of truth arose in the wake of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. [[Martin Heidegger]] pointed out that truth may be essentially a matter of letting [[Being and Time|beings]] (entities of any kind, which can include logical propositions)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Heidegger| first=Martin| title=Being and Time| year=1927| url=http://pdf-objects.com/files/Heidegger-Martin-Being-and-Time-trans.-Macquarrie-Robinson-Blackwell-1962.pdf}} See page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; be free to reveal themselves as they are, and stated:

The quoted text is translated from the German by John Sallis.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gödel agreed that the ability to perceive the truth of a mathematical or logical proposition is a matter of [[logical intuition|intuition]], an ability he admitted could be ultimately beyond the scope of a formal theory of logic or mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Ravitch| first=Harold| title=On Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics| year=1998| url=http://www.friesian.com/goedel/chap-2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Solomon| first=Martin| title=On Kurt Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics| year=1998| url=http://calculemus.org/lect/07logika/godel-solomon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps best considered in the realm of human [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] and communication, but commented:

===Tarski's semantics===
{{main|Semantic theory of truth|Tarski's theory of truth}}

The [[semantic theory of truth]] has as its general case for a given language:
:'P' is true if and only if P
where 'P' refers to the sentence (the sentence's name), and P is just the sentence itself.

[[Tarski's theory of truth]] (named after [[Alfred Tarski]]) was developed for formal languages, such as [[formal logic]]. Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression ''is true'' could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an ''object language'', the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain [[Liar paradox|paradoxical]] sentences such as, "This sentence is not true". As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] used it as the foundation of his [[truth-conditional semantics]] and linked it to [[radical interpretation]] in a form of [[coherentism]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, [[Russell's paradox]]. Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] attempted to solve these problems in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' by putting statements into a hierarchy of [[type theory|types]], wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy.  This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible [[type system]]s that have yet to be resolved to this day.

===Kripke's semantics&lt;!--Linked from 'Semantic theory of truth'--&gt;===
{{Main|Kripke's theory of truth}}
[[Kripke's theory of truth]] (named after [[Saul Kripke]]) contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows:
* Begin with a subset of sentences of a natural language that contains no occurrences of the expression "is true" (or "is false"). So ''The barn is big'' is included in the subset, but not " ''The barn is big'' is true", nor problematic sentences such as "''This sentence'' is false".
* Define truth just for the sentences in that subset.
* Then extend the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences. So "''The barn is big'' is true" is now included, but not either "''This sentence'' is false" nor "'''The barn is big'' is true' is true".
* Next, define truth for all sentences that predicate truth or falsity of a member of the second set. Imagine this process repeated infinitely, so that truth is defined for ''The barn is big''; then for "''The barn is big'' is true"; then for "'''The barn is big'' is true' is true", and so on.

Notice that truth never gets defined for sentences like ''This sentence is false'', since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are "ungrounded." Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the [[principle of bivalence]]: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the [[liar paradox]], the paradox is dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "Outline of a Theory of Truth", Journal of Philosophy, 72 (1975), 690–716&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been [[Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem|shown by Gödel]] that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects can have an informal self-referential meaning; in Gödel's work, these objects are integer numbers, and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions. In fact, this idea—manifested by the [[diagonal lemma]]—is the basis for [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|Tarski's theorem]] that truth cannot be consistently defined.

It has thus been claimed&lt;ref&gt;Keith Simmons, ''Universality and the Liar: An Essay on Truth and the Diagonal Argument'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1993&lt;/ref&gt; that Kripke's system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. While there is still a debate on whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every similar partial truth system, none have been shown to be consistent by [[Consistency proof|acceptable methods]] used in [[mathematical logic]].

==Folk beliefs==
The [[truth predicate]] "''P'' is true" has great practical value in human language, allowing us to ''efficiently'' endorse or impeach claims made by others, to emphasize the truth or falsity of a statement, or to enable various indirect ([[Gricean]]) conversational implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scharp|first1=Kevin|title=Replacing truth|date=2013|publisher=Oxford Univ.

* Capture (''T''-in): If ''P'', then ''P'' is true
* Release (''T''-out): If ''P'' is true, then ''P''
* [[Law of noncontradiction|Noncontradiction]]: A statement can't be both true and false
* Normativity: It is usually good to believe what is true
* False beliefs: The notion that believing a statement doesn't necessarily make it true

Like many folk theories, our folk theory of truth is useful in everyday life but, upon deep analysis, turns out to be technically self-contradictory; in particular, any [[formal system]] that fully obeys Capture and Release semantics for truth (also known as the ''[[T-schema]]''), and that also respects classical logic, is provably [[inconsistent]] and succumbs to the [[liar paradox]] or to a similar contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, Otávio, and Mark Colyvan.

===Ancient ===

====Greek philosophy====

=====Socratic philosophy=====
[[Socrates]]', [[Plato]]'s and [[Aristotle]]'s ideas about truth are seen by some as consistent with [[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence theory]]. In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle stated:  "To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true".&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr&gt;David, Marion (2005). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/#1 "Correspondence Theory of Truth"] in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] proceeds to say of Aristotle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the ''Categories'' (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of "underlying things" that make statements true and implies that these "things" (pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not sitting). Most influential is his claim in ''De Interpretatione'' (16a3) that thoughts are "likenesses" (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought's likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind. [...]&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar statements can also be found in Plato's dialogues (''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' 385b2, ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'' 263b).&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt;

The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] conceived truth as accessible from [[Phantasiai|impressions]] via [[katalepsis|cognitive grasping]].

=====Non-Socratic philosophy=====
Other Greek philosophers maintained that truth was either not accessible to mortals, or of greatly limited accessibility, forming early [[philosophical skepticism]]. Among these were [[Xenophanes]], [[Democritus]], and [[Pyrrho]].

====Religion====

=====Hinduism=====
In [[Hinduism]], Truth is defined as "unchangeable", "that which has no distortion", "that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person", "that which pervades the universe in all its constancy". The human body, therefore is not completely true as it changes with time, for example. There are many references, properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth, such as the national motto of [[India]]: "[[Satyameva Jayate]]" (Truth alone wins), as well as "Satyam muktaye" (Truth liberates), "Satya' is 'Parahit'artham' va'unmanaso yatha'rthatvam' satyam" (Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too), "When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him (patanjali yogasutras, sutra number 2.36), "The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl. ''Unveil it, O Pusan (Sun), so that I who have truth as my duty (satyadharma) may see it!''" (Brhadaranyaka V 15 1–4 and the brief IIsa Upanisad 15–18), Truth is superior to silence ([[Manusmriti]]), etc. Combined with other words, satya acts as modifier, like "'''ultra'''" or "'''highest'''," or more literally "'''truest'''," connoting '''purity and excellence'''. For example, satyaloka is the "highest heaven' and Satya Yuga is the "golden age" or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism, and so on.

=====Buddhism=====
In [[Buddhism]], particularly in the [[Mahayana]] tradition, the notion of truth is often divided into the [[Two Truths Doctrine]], which consists of [[Samvriti|relative or conventional truth]] and ultimate truth. The former refers to truth that is based on common understanding among ordinary people and is accepted as a practical basis for communication of higher truths. Ultimate truth necessarily transcends logic in the sphere of ordinary experience, and recognizes such phenomena as illusory. [[Mādhyamaka]] philosophy asserts that any doctrine can be analyzed with both divisions of truth. Affirmation and negation belong to relative and absolute truth respectively. Political law is regarded as relative, while religious law is absolute. 

=====Christianity=====
[[Christianity]] has a [[Soteriology|soteriological]] view of truth. According to the [[Bible]] in [[John 14:6]], [[Jesus]] is quoted as having said "I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me".

===Middle Ages===

====Avicenna (980–1037)====
In [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his work [[Kitab Al-Shifa]] ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', Book I, Chapter 8, as:
{{quote|What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it.&lt;ref&gt;Osman Amin (2007), "Influence of Muslim Philosophy on the West", ''Monthly Renaissance'' '''17''' (11).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Avicenna]] elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII, Chapter 6:
{{Quote|The truth of a thing is the property of the being of each thing which has been established in it.&lt;ref name=Aertsen&gt;Jan A. Aertsen (1988), ''Nature and Creature: Thomas Aquinas's Way of Thought'', p. 152. Brill, {{ISBN|90-04-08451-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, this definition is merely a rendering of the [[medieval]] Latin translation of the work by Simone van Riet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Simone van Riet
| title = Liber de philosophia prima, sive Scientia divina
| page = 413
| language = Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern translation of the original Arabic text states:

{{quote|Truth is also said of the veridical belief in the existence [of something].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Avicenna: The Metaphysics of The Healing

| year = 2005
| page = 284
| others = Michael E. Marmura
| isbn = 978-0-934893-77-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Aquinas (1225–1274)====
Reevaluating Avicenna, and also Augustine and Aristotle, [[Thomas Aquinas]] stated in his ''Disputed Questions on Truth'':

{{quote|A natural thing, being placed between two intellects, is called ''true'' insofar as it conforms to either. It is said to be true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect insofar as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect... With respect to its conformity with a human intellect, a thing is said to be true insofar as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 1, 2, c, reply to Obj. 1. Trans. Mulligan, McGlynn, Schmidt, ''Truth'', vol. I, pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth).&lt;ref&gt;"Veritas supra ens fundatur" (Truth is founded on being). ''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 10, 2, reply to Obj. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Summa I.16.1]:

{{quote|Veritas est adæquatio intellectus et rei. &lt;br /&gt; (Truth is the conformity of the intellect and things.)}}  Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the [[God|Creator God]] who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; [[reality]]) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the [[sense]]s, then through the [[understanding]] and the [[judgement]] done by [[reason]]. For Aquinas, human [[intelligence]] ("intus", within and "legere", to read) has the capability to reach the [[essence]] and [[existence]] of things because it has a non-material, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability.

====Changing concepts of truth in the Middle Ages====
[[Richard Firth Green]] examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his ''A Crisis of Truth'', and concludes that roughly during the reign of [[Richard II of England]] the very meaning of the concept changes. The idea of the oath, which was so much part and parcel of for instance [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance literature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rock|first=Catherine A.|year=2006|title=Forsworn and Fordone: Arcite as Oath-Breaker in the "Knight's Tale"|journal=[[The Chaucer Review]]|volume=40|issue=4|pages=416–32|jstor=25094334|doi=10.1353/cr.2006.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes from a subjective concept to a more objective one (in [[Derek Pearsall]]'s summary).&lt;ref name=pearsall&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearsall|first=Derek|year=2004|title=Medieval Literature and Historical Enquiry|journal=[[Modern Language Review]]|volume=99|issue=4|pages=xxxi–xlii|jstor=3738608|doi=10.2307/3738608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas truth (the "trouthe" of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'') was first "an ethical truth in which truth is understood to reside in persons", in Ricardian England it "transforms...into a [[political truth]] in which truth is understood to reside in documents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Elizabeth|year=2003|title=Rev. of Green, ''A Crisis of Truth''|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|volume=78|issue=1|pages=179–82|jstor=3301477|doi=10.1017/S0038713400099310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern age===

====Kant (1724–1804)====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

[[Immanuel Kant]] endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth.&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt; Kant writes in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'': "The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed".&lt;ref name = "Kant-1781"&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1781/1787), ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Translated and edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), A58/B82.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kant denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. Kant states in his logic lectures:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only ''by cognizing it''.&lt;!-- I wonder if the original had this cursive... --&gt; Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object.

The ancients called such a circle in explanation a ''diallelon''. And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man. [...]&lt;ref name = "Kant-1801"&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1801), ''The Jäsche Logic'', in ''Lectures on Logic''. Translated and edited by J. Michael Young (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 557–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition.&lt;ref name = "Vanzo-Kant"&gt;Alberto Vanzo, "Kant on the Nominal Definition of Truth", ''Kant-Studien'', 101 (2010), pp. 147–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is "impossible without qualification and for every man".&lt;ref name = "Kant-1801" /&gt;

====Hegel (1770–1831)====
[[Georg Hegel]] distanced his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self-moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to the [[mechanics]] of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. "Truth is its own self-movement within itself."&lt;ref&gt;"Die Wahrheit ist die Bewegung ihrer an ihr selbst." ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', Preface, ¶ 48&lt;/ref&gt; Teleological truth moves itself in the three-step form of [[Dialectic|dialectical triplicity]] toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. According to Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth. [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus|Chalybäus]] used the terms "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]]", "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]]", and "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]" to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity.  The "thesis" consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an "antithesis" occurs which opposes the "thesis." In turn, the "synthesis" appears when the "thesis" and "antithesis" become [[Aufheben|reconciled]] and a higher level of truth is obtained. This "synthesis" thereby becomes a "thesis," which will again necessitate an "antithesis," requiring a new "synthesis" until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Spirit]] moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self at the very end of history. Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite [[God]].

====Schopenhauer (1788–1860)====
For [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref&gt;''On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', §§ 29–33&lt;/ref&gt; a [[judgment]] is a combination or separation of two or more [[concept]]s. If a judgment is to be an expression of [[knowledge]], it must have a [[Principle of sufficient reason|sufficient reason]] or ground by which the judgment could be called true. ''Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground)''. Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has ''material'' truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or ''formal''. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has ''transcendental'' truth.

====Kierkegaard (1813–1855)====
When [[Søren Kierkegaard]], as his character ''Johannes Climacus'', ends his writings: ''My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth'', he does not advocate for [[subjectivism]] in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one's actual experience of life.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

While objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'', Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nietzsche (1844–1900)====
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed the search for truth, or 'the will to truth', was a consequence of the ''[[will to power]]'' of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the ''will to power'', and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', "The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding..." (aphorism 4). He proposed the ''will to power'' as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.

Robert Wicks discusses Nietzsche's basic view of truth as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Some scholars regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" ("Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call "truth" is only "a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms." His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; "truth" is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence. [...]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wicks, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#EarWri187187 Friedrich Nietzsche – Early Writings: 1872–1876], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Spring 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Separately Nietzsche suggested that an ancient, metaphysical belief in the divinity of Truth lies at the heart of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent [[Western intellectual tradition]]: "But you will have gathered what I am getting at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith on which our faith in science rests—that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take ''our'' fire too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato's faith, that God is Truth; that Truth is 'Divine'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vf8KETLiKXMC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22&amp;f=false|title=Nietzsche: The Gay Science: With a Prelude in German Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs|first1=Friedrich|last1=Nietzsche|first2=Bernard|last2=Williams|first3=Josefine|last3=Nauckhoff|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0-521-63645-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wMzu8j4D1SYC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22#v=onepage&amp;q=god%20is%20truth&amp;f=false|title=Nietzsche: 'On the Genealogy of Morality' and Other Writings Student Edition|first=Friedrich|last=Nietzsche|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1-139-46121-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heidegger (1889–1976)====
Other philosophers take this common meaning to be secondary and derivative. According to [[Martin Heidegger]], the original meaning and [[essence]] of truth in [[Ancient Greece]] was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, as indicated by the original Greek term for truth, ''[[aletheia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Martin-Heidegger-On-the-Essence-of-Truth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontology.co/heidegger-aletheia.htm|title=Martin Heidegger on Aletheia (Truth) as Unconcealment|publisher=|access-date=2010-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626101634/http://www.ontology.co/heidegger-aletheia.htm|archive-date=2015-06-26|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the [[Latin]] term ''[[veritas]]''.

====Whitehead (1861–1947)====
[[Alfred North Whitehead]], a British mathematician who became an American philosopher, said: "There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Dialogues'', 1954: Prologue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie, since [[half-truth]]s are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion.

====Peirce (1839–1914)====
[[Pragmatists]] like [[C. S. Peirce]] take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and [[discovering]] truth, with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human [[inquiry]] would find out on a matter, if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go: "The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html|title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nishida (1870–1945)====
According to [[Kitaro Nishida]], "knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing."&lt;ref&gt;John Maraldo, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nishida-kitaro/#2.2 Nishida Kitarô – Self-Awareness], in: ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2005 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fromm (1900–1980)====
[[Erich Fromm]] finds that trying to discuss truth as "absolute truth" is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on "optimal truth". He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in "a strange and powerful world". The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described partly in "Man from Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics" (1947), from which excerpts are included below.

: the dichotomy between 'absolute = perfect' and 'relative = imperfect' has been superseded in all fields of scientific thought, where "it is generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles".

: In that respect, "a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of a desired result". The history of science is "a history of inadequate and incomplete statements, and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation."

: As a result "the history of thought is the history of an ever-increasing approximation to the truth. Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal; it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period." Fromm furthermore notes that "different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth" and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate, increasing further the approximation to the truth.

====Foucault (1926–1984)====
[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|''[[John 18:38|Quid Est Veritas?]]'' [[Christ]] and [[Pilate]], by [[Nikolai Ge]].]]

Truth, says [[Michel Foucault]], is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an "objective" quality.  He prefers not to use the term truth itself but "Regimes of Truth".  In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure.  Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of [[Truth#Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].  Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various [[episteme]] throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. "The Order of Things", London: Vintage Books, 1970 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baudrillard (1929–2007)====
[[Jean Baudrillard]] considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something.  He took his cue from [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] whom he claims knew that images of God demonstrated that God did not exist.&lt;ref name = "Baudrillard"&gt;Jean Baudrillard. Simulacra and Simulation. Michigan: Michigan University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard wrote in "Precession of the Simulacra":
::The [[simulacrum]] is never that which conceals the truth—it is the truth which conceals that there is none.  The simulacrum is true.
::—Ecclesiastes&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean. [http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html "Simulacra and Simulations", in ''Selected Writings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209024621/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html |date=2004-02-09 }}, ed. [[Mark Poster]], [[Stanford University Press]], 1988; 166 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard's attribution of this quote to [[Ecclesiastes]] is deliberately fictional. "Baudrillard attributes this quote to Ecclesiastes.  However, the quote is a fabrication (see Jean Baudrillard.  Cool Memories III, 1991–95. London:   Verso, 1997). Editor's note: In Fragments: Conversations With François L'Yvonnet. New York: Routledge, 2004:11, Baudrillard acknowledges this 'Borges-like' fabrication." Cited in footnote #4 in Smith, Richard G., [https://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_1/smith.htm#_edn4 "Lights, Camera, Action: Baudrillard and the Performance of Representations"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425060347/https://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_1/smith.htm#_edn4 |date=2018-04-25 }}, International Journal of Baudrillard Studies, Volume 2, Number 1 (January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of [[simulacra]] that Baudrillard cited were: that prisons simulate the "truth" that society is free; scandals (e.g., [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]) simulate that corruption is corrected; Disney simulates that the U.S. itself is an adult place. One must remember that though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate.&lt;ref name = "Baudrillard"/&gt;

==In medicine and psychiatry==
There is controversy as to the truth value of a proposition made in [[bad faith]] self-deception, such as when a [[hypochondriac]] has a complaint with no physical symptom.&lt;ref name=PMREN&gt;"Absent a lesion or a physiological disturbance to account readily for the complaint, the complaint was likely to be regarded as male fide", "Post-Modern Reflections on the Ethics of Naming", ''The Ethics of Diagnosis Philosophy and Medicine'', 1992, Volume 40, Section V, 275–300, George Khushf, [https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-0-585-28333-3_21 springerlink.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Philosophy sidebar}}'''Analytic philosophy''' is a branch or tradition of [[philosophy]] using [[philosophical analysis|analysis]] which is popular in the [[Western world|Western World]] and [[Anglosphere]], beginning around the turn of the [[20th century]] in the contemporary era and continues today. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Scandinavia]], the majority of university philosophy departments today identify themselves as "analytic" departments.&lt;ref name="Searle03P1"&gt;
"Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the analytic tradition—such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism, existentialism, or Marxism—feel it necessary to define their position in relation to analytic philosophy." [[John Searle]] (2003), ''Contemporary Philosophy in the United States'' in N. Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed., (Blackwell, 2003), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Central figures in this historical development of analytic philosophy are [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Other figures in its history include the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], and [[Karl Popper]].

Analytic philosophy is characterized by an emphasis on [[language]], known as the [[linguistic turn]], and for its clarity and rigor in arguments, making use of [[formal logic]] and [[mathematics]], and, to a lesser degree, the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref name="LeiterWeb"&gt;[[Brian Leiter]] (2006) webpage [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115002425/https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp ''"Analytic" and "Continental" Philosophy'']&lt;!-- https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic-and-continental-philosophy/ --&gt;. Quote on the definition: "'Analytic' philosophy today names a ''style'' of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics, than with the humanities."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Glock|first1=H.J.|year=2004|title=Was Wittgenstein an Analytic Philosopher?|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=35|issue=4|pages=419–444|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2004.00329.x|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colin McGinn, ''The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey through Twentieth-Century Philosophy'' (HarperCollins, 2002), p. xi.: "analytical philosophy [is] too narrow a label, since [it] is not generally a matter of taking a word or concept and analyzing it (whatever exactly that might be). [...] This tradition emphasizes clarity, rigor, argument, theory, truth. It is not a tradition that aims primarily for inspiration or consolation or ideology. Nor is it particularly concerned with 'philosophy of life,' though parts of it are. This kind of philosophy is more like science than religion, more like mathematics than poetry—though it is neither science nor mathematics."&lt;/ref&gt; It also takes things piecemeal, "an attempt to focus philosophical reflection on smaller problems that lead to answers to bigger questions."&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Avrum Stroll, ''Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy'' (Columbia University Press, 2000), p. 5: "[I]t is difficult to give a precise definition of 'analytic philosophy' since it is not so much a specific doctrine as a loose concatenation of approaches to problems." Also, see Stroll (2000), p. 7: "I think Sluga is right in saying 'it may be hopeless to try to determine the essence of analytic philosophy.' Nearly every proposed definition has been challenged by some scholar. [...] [W]e are dealing with a family resemblance concept."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Hans-Johann Glock]], ''What Is Analytic Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 205: "The answer to the title question, then, is that analytic philosophy is a tradition held together ''both'' by ties of mutual influence ''and'' by family resemblances."&lt;/ref&gt; Analytic philosophy is often understood in contrast to other philosophical traditions, most notably [[continental philosophy|continental philosophies]] such as [[existentialism]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[Hegelianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A.C. Grayling]] (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 2: "Analytic philosophy is mainly associated with the contemporary English-speaking world, but it is by no means the only important philosophical tradition. In this volume two other immensely rich and important such traditions are introduced: Indian philosophy, and philosophical thought in Europe from the time of Hegel." L.J. Cohen, ''The Dialogue of Reason: An Analysis of Analytical Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 5: "So, despite a few overlaps, analytical philosophy is not difficult to distinguish broadly [...] from other modern movements, like phenomenology, say, or existentialism, or from the large amount of philosophizing that has also gone on in the present century within frameworks deriving from other influential thinkers like Aquinas, Hegel, or Marx." H.-J. Glock, ''What Is Analytic Philosophy?'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 86: "Most non-analytic philosophers of the twentieth century do not belong to continental philosophy."&lt;/ref&gt;  Russell contrasted analytic "academic" philosophy with continental "literary" philosophy.

==History&lt;!--'History of analytic philosophy', 'History of Analytic philosophy', 'History of analytical philosophy', and 'History of Analytical philosophy' redirect here--&gt;==
[[British idealism]], as taught by philosophers such as [[F.H. Bradley]] (1846–1924) and [[Thomas Hill Green]] (1836–1882), dominated English philosophy in the late 19th century. 

Since its beginning, a basic goal of analytic philosophy has been conceptual clarity,&lt;ref name="PenguinDicP22"&gt;Mautner, Thomas (editor) (2005) ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'', entry for 'Analytic philosophy'', pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; in the name of which Moore and Russell rejected [[Hegelianism]] for being obscure—see for example Moore's "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]" and Russell's critique of the [[doctrine of internal relations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Analytic philosophy opposed right from its beginning English neo-Hegelianism of Bradley's sort and similar ones. It did not only criticize the latter's denial of the existence of an external world (anyway an unjust criticism), but also the bombastic, obscure style of Hegel's writings." {{cite journal|last=Jonkers |first=Peter |year=2003 |title=Perspectives on Twentieth Century Philosophy:A Reply to Tom Rockmore |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |volume=3 |issn=1566-5399 |url=http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000129/article.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128165848/http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000129/article.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by developments in modern logic, the early Russell claimed that the problems of philosophy can be solved by showing the simple constituents of complex notions.&lt;ref name="PenguinDicP22"/&gt; An important aspect of British idealism was [[logical holism]]—the opinion that there are aspects of the world that can be known only by knowing the whole world. This is closely related to the opinion that [[Property (philosophy)#Relations|relations]] between items are ''internal relations'', that is, [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of the nature of those items. Russell, along with Wittgenstein, in response promulgated [[logical atomism]] and the doctrine of ''external relations''—the belief that the world consists of ''independent'' facts.&lt;ref&gt;Baillie, James, "Introduction to Bertrand Russell" in ''Contemporary Analytic Philosophy, Second Edition'' (Prentice Hall, 1997), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell, during his early career, along with his collaborator [[Alfred North Whitehead]], was much influenced by [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925), who developed [[predicate logic]], which allowed a much greater range of sentences to be parsed into logical form than was possible using the ancient [[Aristotelian logic]]. Frege was also influential as a [[philosophy of mathematics|philosopher of mathematics]] in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. In contrast to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1891 book ''Philosophie der Arithmetik'', which argued that the concept of the [[cardinal number]] derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Willard, Dallas|title= Husserl on a Logic that Failed|journal= Philosophical Review|pages= 52–53|volume= 89|issue= 1|doi= 10.2307/2184863|jstor= 2184863|year= 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frege argued that mathematics and logic have their own validity, independent of the judgments or mental states of individual mathematicians and logicians (which were the basis of arithmetic according to the "[[psychologism]]" of Husserl's ''Philosophie''). Frege further developed his philosophy of logic and mathematics in ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (1884) and ''The Basic Laws of Arithmetic'' ({{lang-de|Grundgesetze der Arithmetik}}, 1893–1903), where he provided an alternative to psychologistic accounts of the concept of number.

Like Frege, Russell argued that mathematics is reducible to logical fundamentals in ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903). Later, his book written with Whitehead, ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–1913), encouraged many philosophers to renew their interest in the development of [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]]. Additionally, Russell adopted Frege's predicate logic as his primary philosophical method, a method Russell thought could expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems. For example, the English word [[to be|"is"]] has three distinct meanings which predicate logic can express as follows:
* For the sentence 'the cat ''is'' asleep', the ''is'' of predication means that "x is P" (denoted as P(x)).
* For the sentence 'there ''is'' a cat', the ''is'' of existence means that "there is an x" (∃x).
* For the sentence 'three ''is'' half of six', the ''is'' of identity means that "x is the same as y" (x=y).

Russell sought to resolve various philosophical problems by applying such logical distinctions, most famously in his analysis of [[definite description]]s in "[[On Denoting]]" (1905).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|year=1905|title=On Denoting|journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]|volume=14|pages=473–493|url=http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Russell/rus_deno.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331212120/http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Russell/rus_deno.html|archivedate=2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideal language &lt;!--Linked from 'Ludwig Wittgenstein', 'Template:Wittgenstein' and 'Linguistic philosophy'--&gt;===
{{main|Ideal language philosophy}}
From about 1910 to 1930, analytic philosophers like Russell and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] emphasized creating an ideal language for philosophical analysis, which would be free from the ambiguities of ordinary language that, in their opinion, often made philosophy invalid. During this phase, Russell and Wittgenstein sought to understand language (and hence philosophical problems) by using [[logic|formal logic]] to formalize the way in which philosophical [[statement (logic)|statements]] are made. 

=== Logical atomism ===
Russell became an advocate of [[logical atomism]]. Wittgenstein developed a comprehensive system of logical atomism in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' ({{lang-de | Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung}}, 1921). He thereby argued that the universe is the totality of actual states of affairs and that these states of affairs can be expressed by the language of first-order predicate logic. Thus a ''picture'' of the universe can be construed by means of expressing atomic facts in the form of atomic propositions, and linking them using [[logical operator]]s.

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
During the late 1920s, to 1940s, a group of philosophers of the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[Berlin Circle]] developed Russell and Wittgenstein's formalism into a doctrine known as "[[logical positivism]]" (or logical empiricism). Logical positivism used formal logical methods to develop an empiricist account of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Carnap, R.|title= The Logical Structure of the World|publisher= Felix Meiner Verlag|year= 1928|lccn= 66013604|isbn= 978-0-8126-9523-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Hans Reichenbach]], along with other members of the Vienna Circle, claimed that the truths of logic and mathematics were [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and those of science were verifiable empirical claims. These two constituted the entire universe of meaningful judgments; anything else was nonsense. The claims of ethics, aesthetics and theology were consequently reduced to pseudo-statements, neither empirically true nor false, and therefore meaningless. In reaction to what he considered excesses of logical positivism, [[Karl Popper]] insisted on the role of [[falsifiability|falsification]] in the philosophy of science—although his general method was also part of the analytic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Popper, Karl R.|title= The Logic of Scientific Discovery|publisher= Routledge|year= 2002 | isbn= 978-0-415-27844-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]] in 1933, many members of the Vienna and Berlin Circles fled to Britain and the US, which helped to reinforce the dominance of logical positivism and analytic philosophy in anglophone countries.

Logical positivists typically considered philosophy as having a very limited function. For them, philosophy concerned the clarification of thoughts, rather than having a distinct subject matter of its own. The positivists adopted the [[verification principle]], according to which every meaningful statement is either [[Analytic proposition|analytic]] or is capable of being verified by experience. This caused the logical positivists to reject many traditional problems of philosophy, especially those of [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]], as meaningless.

===Ordinary language ===
{{Main|Ordinary language philosophy}}

After [[World War II]], during the late 1940s and 1950s, analytic philosophy became involved with ordinary-language analysis. This resulted in two main trends. One continued Wittgenstein's later philosophy, which differed dramatically from his early work of the ''Tractatus''. The other, known as [[Ordinary-language philosophy|"Oxford philosophy"]], involved [[J.L. Austin]]. In contrast to earlier analytic philosophers (including the early Wittgenstein) who thought philosophers should avoid the deceptive trappings of natural language by constructing ideal languages, ordinary-language philosophers claimed that ordinary language already represents many subtle distinctions not recognized in the formulation of traditional philosophical theories or problems. While schools such as logical positivism emphasize logical terms, supposed to be universal and separate from contingent factors (such as culture, language, historical conditions), ordinary-language philosophy emphasizes the use of language by ordinary people. The most prominent ordinary-language philosophers during the 1950s were the aforementioned Austin and [[Gilbert Ryle]].

Ordinary-language philosophers often sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing them to be the result of misunderstanding ordinary language. Examples include Ryle, who tried to dispose of "[[Ghost in the machine|Descartes' myth]]", and Wittgenstein.

==Contemporary analytic philosophy==
Although contemporary philosophers who self-identify as "analytic" have widely divergent interests, assumptions, and methods—and have often rejected the fundamental premises that defined analytic philosophy before 1960—analytic philosophy today is usually considered to be defined by a particular style,&lt;ref name="LeiterWeb"/&gt; characterized by precision and thoroughness about a specific topic, and resistance to "imprecise or cavalier discussions of broad topics".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

During the 1950s, logical positivism was challenged influentially by Wittgenstein in the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] in "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", and Sellars in ''[[Wilfrid Sellars|Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind]]''. After 1960, anglophone philosophy began to incorporate a wider range of interests, opinions, and methods.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Still, many philosophers in Britain and America still consider themselves "analytic philosophers".&lt;ref name="Searle03P1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeiterWeb"/&gt; They have done so largely by expanding the notion of "analytic philosophy" from the specific programs that dominated anglophone philosophy before 1960 to a much more general notion of an "analytic" style.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/analytic.htm |title=Analytic Philosophy Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |accessdate=2018-04-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703212901/http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/analytic.htm |archivedate=2009-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many philosophers and historians have attempted to define or describe analytic philosophy. Those definitions often include an emphasis on conceptual analysis: [[A.P. Martinich]] draws an analogy between analytic philosophy's interest in conceptual analysis and analytic chemistry, which aims to determine chemical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A companion to analytic philosophy|last=|first=|publisher=Blackwell|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-21415-1|editor=[[A.P. Martinich]]|location=Malden, MA|pages=1–5|doi=10.1002/9780470998656.ch1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven D. Hales described analytic philosophy as one of three types of philosophical method practiced in the West: "[i]n roughly reverse order by number of proponents, they are phenomenology, ideological philosophy, and analytic philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hales|first=Steven D.|title=Analytic philosophy : classic readings|year=2002|publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-534-51277-4|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Soames]] agrees that clarity is important: analytic philosophy, he says, has "an implicit commitment—albeit faltering and imperfect—to the ideals of clarity, rigor and argumentation" and it "aims at truth and knowledge, as opposed to moral or spiritual improvement [...] the goal in analytic philosophy is to discover what is true, not to provide a useful recipe for living one's life". Soames also states that analytic philosophy is characterised by "a more piecemeal approach. There is, I think, a widespread presumption within the tradition that it is often possible to make philosophical progress by intensively investigating a small, circumscribed range of philosophical issues while holding broader, systematic questions in abeyance".&lt;ref name=Soames&gt;{{cite book |last=Soames|first=Scott|title=The dawn of analysis|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-11573-3|pages=xiii–xvii|edition=2nd print., 1st paperb. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the most important and active topics and subtopics of analytic philosophy are summarized by the following sections.

===Philosophy of mind and cognitive science===

Motivated by the logical positivists' interest in verificationism, [[logical behaviorism]] was the most prominent [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]] of analytic philosophy for the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, George, "Behaviorism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/behaviorism/]&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorists tended to opine either that statements about the mind were equivalent to ''statements about'' behavior and dispositions to behave in particular ways or that mental states were directly equivalent to behavior and dispositions to behave. Behaviorism later became much less popular, in favor of [[Identity theory of mind|type physicalism]] or [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], theories that identified mental states with brain states. During this period, topics of the philosophy of mind were often related strongly to topics of [[cognitive science]] such as [[modularity of mind|modularity]] or [[Psychological nativism|innateness]]. Finally, analytic philosophy has featured a certain number of philosophers who were [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualists]], and recently forms of property dualism have had a resurgence; the most prominent representative  is [[David Chalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=dualism |title=Dualism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Searle]] suggests that the obsession with the philosophy of language during the 20th century has been superseded by an emphasis on the [[philosophy of mind]],&lt;ref&gt;Postrel and Feser, February 2000, ''Reality Principles: An Interview with John R. Searle'' at {{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/27599.html |title=Reality Principles: An Interview with John R. Searle |accessdate=2008-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929023644/http://www.reason.com/news/show/27599.html |archivedate=2008-09-29 |date=February 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which functionalism is currently the dominant theory. In recent years, a central focus of research in the philosophy of mind has been [[consciousness]]. While there is a general consensus for the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The best known theories are [[Daniel Dennett]]'s [[heterophenomenology]], [[Fred Dretske]] and [[Michael Tye (philosopher)|Michael Tye]]'s [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]], and the higher-order theories of either [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David M.

===Ethics in analytic philosophy===

Due to the commitments to [[empiricism]] and [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]] in the early analytic period, early analytic philosophers often thought that inquiry in the ethical domain could not be made rigorous enough to merit any attention.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5lK6DTadnaQC&amp;pg=PT213&amp;dq=%22analytic+philosophy%22+ethics#v=onepage&amp;q=%22analytic%20philosophy%22%20ethics&amp;f=false|title=A Brief History of Analytic Philosophy: From Russell to Rawls|last=Schwartz|first=Stephen P.|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-27172-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only with the emergence of ordinary language philosophers that ethics started to become an acceptable area of inquiry for analytic philosophers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Philosophers working with the analytic tradition have gradually come to distinguish three major types of moral philosophy.
* [[Meta-ethics]] which investigates moral terms and concepts;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Key Terms in Ethics|last=Kuusela|first=Oskari|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4411-6610-4|location=London|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Normative ethics]] which examines and produces normative ethical judgments;
* [[Applied ethics]] which investigates how existing normative principles should be applied to difficult or borderline cases, often cases created by new technology or new scientific knowledge.

====Meta-ethics====
Twentieth-century meta-ethics has two origins. The first is G.E. Moore's investigation into the nature of ethical terms (e.g., good) in his ''Principia Ethica'' (1903), which identified the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. Along with Hume's famous is/ought distinction, the naturalistic fallacy was a major topic of investigation for analytical philosophers.

The second is in logical positivism and its attitude that statements which are unverifiable are meaningless. Although that attitude was adopted originally to promote scientific investigation by rejecting grand metaphysical systems, it had the side effect of making (ethical and aesthetic) value judgments (as well as religious statements and beliefs) meaningless. But because value judgments are of major importance in human life, it became incumbent on logical positivism to develop an explanation of the nature and meaning of value judgements. As a result, analytic philosophers avoided normative ethics, and instead began [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] investigations into the nature of moral terms, statements, and judgments.

The [[logical positivist]]s opined that statements about [[Value (ethics)|value]]—including all ethical and aesthetic judgments—are [[non-cognitivism|non-cognitive]]; that is, they cannot be objectively verified or falsified. Instead, the logical positivists adopted an [[emotivism|emotivist]] theory, which was that value judgments expressed the attitude of the speaker. For example, in this view, saying, "Killing is wrong", is equivalent to saying, "Boo to murder", or saying the word "murder" with a particular tone of disapproval.

While non-cognitivism was generally accepted by analytic philosophers, emotivism had many deficiencies, and evolved into more sophisticated non-cognitivist theories such as the [[expressivism]] of [[Charles Stevenson]], and the [[universal prescriptivism]] of [[R.M. Hare]], which was based on J.L. Austin's philosophy of [[speech acts]].

These theories were not without their critics. [[Philippa Foot]] contributed several essays attacking all these theories. [[J.O. Urmson]]'s article "On Grading" called the is/ought distinction into question.

As non-cognitivism, the is/ought distinction, and the naturalistic fallacy began to be called into question, analytic philosophers showed a renewed interest in the traditional questions of moral philosophy. Perhaps the most influential being [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], whose monograph ''Intention'' was called by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] "the most important treatment of action since Aristotle".&lt;ref&gt;From the cover of the 2000 Harvard University Press edition of ''Intention''.&lt;/ref&gt; A favorite student and friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein, her 1958 article "Modern Moral Philosophy" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the philosophical lexicon, declared the "is-ought" impasse to be unproductive, and resulted in a revival of virtue ethics.

====Normative ethics====
The first half of the 20th century was marked by skepticism toward, and neglect of, normative ethics. Related subjects, such as social and political philosophy, aesthetics, and [[philosophy of history]], became only marginal topics of English-language philosophy during this period.

During this time, [[utilitarianism]] was the only non-skeptical type of ethics to remain popular. However, as the influence of logical positivism began to decrease mid-century, analytic philosophers had renewed interest in ethics. [[G.E.M. Anscombe]]'s 1958 "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" sparked a revival of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Virtue ethics|virtue ethical]] approach and [[John Rawls]]'s 1971 ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' restored interest in [[Kantian]] ethical philosophy. Today, contemporary normative ethics is dominated by three schools: [[consequentialism]], [[virtue ethics]], and [[deontology]].

====Applied ethics====
A significant feature of analytic philosophy since approximately 1970 has been the emergence of [[applied ethics]]—an interest in the application of moral principles to specific practical issues. The philosophers following this orientation view ethics as involving humanistic values, which involve practical implications and applications in the way people interact and lead their lives socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophical Perspectives on Communalism and Morality in African Traditions|last=Ikuenobe|first=Polycarp|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7391-1131-4|location=Oxford|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics of special interest for applied ethics include [[Environmental ethics|environmental issues]], [[animal rights]], and the many challenges created by advancing [[bioethics|medical science]].&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Andrew and Yeuk-Sze Lo (2002).

===Analytic philosophy of religion===

In ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion'', Harris noted that
{{quote|
analytic philosophy has been a very heterogeneous 'movement'.... some forms of analytic philosophy have proven very sympathetic to the philosophy of religion and have actually provided a philosophical mechanism for responding to other more radical and hostile forms of analytic philosophy.&lt;ref name=harris2001&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=James Franklin |title=Analytic philosophy of religion |date=2002 |publisher=Kluwer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-1-4020-0530-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rx2Qf9ieFKYC}} (432 pages) (volume 3 of Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion, {{ISSN|1568-1556}})&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}
}}

As with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of [[philosophy of religion]], largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists) the subject as part of [[metaphysics]] and therefore meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;(a notable exception is the series of [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael B. Forest]]'s 1934–36 [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']] articles involving the Christian doctrine of creation and the rise of modern science).&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of logical positivism renewed interest in philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers like [[William Alston]], [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Robert Merrihew Adams]], [[Richard Swinburne]], and [[Antony Flew]] not only to introduce new problems, but to re-study classical topics such as the nature of [[miracle]]s, theistic arguments, the [[problem of evil]], (see [[existence of God]]) the rationality of belief in [[God]], concepts of the nature of God, and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Michael et al. (2003). ''Reason and Religious Belief''&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga, Mackie and Flew debated the logical validity of the ''free will defense'' as a way to solve the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, John L. (1982). ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God''&lt;/ref&gt; Alston, grappling with the consequences of analytic [[philosophy of language]], worked on the nature of religious language. Adams worked on the relationship of faith and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M. (1987). ''The Virtue of Faith And Other Essays in Philosophical Theology''&lt;/ref&gt; Analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for a number of philosophically-sophisticated theistic arguments, like those of the [[reformed epistemology|reformed epistemologists]] like Plantinga.

Analytic philosophy of religion has also been preoccupied with Wittgenstein, as well as his interpretation of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Creegan, Charles. (1989). ''Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard: Religion, Individuality and Philosophical Method''&lt;/ref&gt; Using first-hand remarks (which was later published in ''Philosophical Investigations'', ''Culture and Value'', and other works), philosophers such as [[Peter Winch]] and [[Norman Malcolm]] developed what has come to be known as ''contemplative philosophy'', a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the "Swansea tradition," and which includes Wittgensteinians such as [[Rush Rhees]], Peter Winch, and [[D.Z. Phillips]], among others. The name "contemplative philosophy" was first coined by D.Z. Phillips in ''Philosophy's Cool Place'', which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein's "Culture and Value."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D.Z. (1999). ''Philosophy's Cool Place.'' Cornell University Press. The quote is from Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'' (2e): "My ideal is a certain coolness. A temple providing a setting for the passions without meddling with them.''&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation was first labeled, "Wittgensteinian [[Fideism]]," by Kai Nielsen but those who consider themselves Wittgensteinians in the Swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein's considered position; this is especially true of D.Z. Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=fideism |title=Fideism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to this interpretation, [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] and D.Z. Phillips became two of the most prominent philosophers on Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Kai and D.Z. Phillips. (2005). ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political philosophy===

====Liberalism====
Current analytic political philosophy owes much to [[John Rawls]], who in a series of papers from the 1950s onward (most notably "Two Concepts of Rules" and "Justice as Fairness") and his 1971 book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', produced a sophisticated defence of a generally liberal egalitarian account of distributive justice. This was followed soon by Rawls's colleague [[Robert Nozick]]'s book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', a defence of [[free-market]] [[libertarianism]]. [[Isaiah Berlin]] also had a lasting influence on both analytic political philosophy and [[liberalism]] with his lecture "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]".

During recent decades there have also been several critiques of liberalism, including the [[feminism|feminist]] critiques of [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]], the [[communitarianism|communitarian]] critiques of [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (although neither of them endorses the term), and the [[multiculturalism|multiculturalist]] critiques of [[Amy Gutmann]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. Although not an analytic philosopher, [[Jürgen Habermas]] is another important—if controversial—author of contemporary analytic political philosophy, whose social theory is a blend of social science, Marxism, [[neo-Kantianism]], and American [[pragmatism]].

[[Consequentialist libertarianism]] also derives from the analytic tradition.

====Analytical Marxism====
Another development of political philosophy was the emergence of the school of [[analytical Marxism]]. Members of this school seek to apply techniques of analytic philosophy and modern social science such as [[rational choice theory]] to clarify the theories of [[Karl Marx]] and his successors. The best-known member of this school is [[G.A. Cohen]], whose 1978 work, ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'', is generally considered to represent the genesis of this school. In that book, Cohen used logical and linguistic analysis to clarify and defend Marx's materialist conception of history. Other prominent analytical Marxists include the economist [[John Roemer]], the social scientist [[Jon Elster]], and the sociologist [[Erik Olin Wright]]. The work of these later philosophers have furthered Cohen's work by bringing to bear modern social science methods, such as rational choice theory, to supplement Cohen's use of analytic philosophical techniques in the interpretation of Marxian theory.

Cohen himself would later engage directly with Rawlsian political philosophy to advance a [[socialist]] theory of justice that contrasts with both traditional Marxism and the theories advanced by Rawls and Nozick. In particular, he indicates Marx's principle of [[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].

====Communitarianism====
[[Communitarian]]s such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Michael Walzer]], and [[Michael Sandel]] advance a critique of liberalism that uses analytic techniques to isolate the main assumptions of liberal individualists, such as Rawls, and then challenges these assumptions. In particular, communitarians challenge the liberal assumption that the individual can be considered as fully autonomous from the community in which he lives and is brought up. Instead, they argue for a conception of the individual that emphasizes the role that the community plays in forming his or her values, thought processes and opinions.

===Analytic metaphysics===
{{Main|Metaphysics}}

One striking difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century. Philosophers such as [[David Kellogg Lewis]] and [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]] developed elaborate theories on a range of topics such as universals, causation, possibility and necessity, and abstract objects.

Among the developments that resulted in the revival of metaphysical theorizing were [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s attack on the [[analytic proposition|analytic–synthetic distinction]], which was generally considered to weaken [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]'s distinction between existence questions internal to a framework and those external to it.&lt;ref&gt;S. Yablo and A. Gallois, ''Does Ontology Rest on a Mistake?'', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes, Vol. 72, (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;229–261, 263–283 [https://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/om.pdf first part] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912125408/http://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/om.pdf |date=2011-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Important also for the revival of metaphysics was the further development of [[modal logic]], including the work of [[Saul Kripke]], who argued in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' and elsewhere for the existence of [[essence]]s and the possibility of [[Alethic modal logic|necessary]], [[a posteriori]] truths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dean Zimmerman|Zimmerman, Dean W.]], "Prologue" in ''Oxford Studies in Metaphysics, Volume 1'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysics remains a fertile topic of research, having recovered from the attacks of [[A.J. Ayer]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]]. Although many discussions are continuations of old ones from previous decades and centuries, the debate remains active. The philosophy of fiction, the problem of empty names, and the debate over existence's status as a property have all become major concerns, while perennial issues such as free will, possible worlds, and the [[philosophy of time]] have been revived.&lt;ref&gt;Everett, Anthony and Thomas Hofweber (eds.) (2000), ''Empty Names, Fiction and the Puzzles of Non-Existence.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inwagenetall1998&gt;Van Inwagen, Peter, and Dean Zimmerman (eds.) (1998), ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Science has also had an increasingly significant role in metaphysics. The theory of special relativity has had a profound effect on the philosophy of time, and quantum physics is routinely discussed in the free will debate.&lt;ref name=inwagenetall1998/&gt; The weight given to scientific evidence is largely due to widespread commitments among philosophers to [[scientific realism]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]].

===Philosophy of language===
{{Main|Philosophy of language}}
Philosophy of language is a topic that has decreased in activity during the last four decades, as evidenced by the fact that few major philosophers today treat it as a primary research topic. Indeed, while the debate remains fierce, it is still strongly influenced by those authors from the first half of the century: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J.L. Austin]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]].

In [[Saul Kripke]]'s publication ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', he argued influentially that flaws in common theories of proper names are indicative of larger misunderstandings of the metaphysics of necessity and possibility. By wedding the techniques of modal logic to a causal theory of reference, Kripke was widely regarded as reviving theories of essence and identity as respectable topics of philosophical discussion.

Another influential philosopher, [[Pavel Tichý]] initiated Transparent Intensional Logic, an original theory of the [[logical analysis]] of [[natural language]]s—the theory is devoted to the problem of saying exactly what it is that we learn, know and can communicate when we come to understand what a sentence means.

===Philosophy of science===
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
Reacting against both the verificationism of the logical positivists as well as the critiques of the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]], who had suggested the [[falsifiability]] criterion on which to judge the demarcation between science and non-science, discussions of [[philosophy of science]] during the last 40 years were dominated by [[social constructivism|social constructivist]] and [[cognitive relativism|cognitive relativist]] theories of science. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] with his formulation of [[paradigm shift]]s and [[Paul Feyerabend]] with his [[epistemological anarchism]] are significant for these discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Glock 2008, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[philosophy of biology]] has also undergone considerable growth, particularly due to the considerable debate in recent years over the nature of [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Hull, David L. and [[Michael Ruse|Ruse, Michael]], "Preface" in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. xix &amp; xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Dennett and his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', which defends [[Neo-Darwinism]], stand at the foreground of this debate.&lt;ref&gt;Lennox, James G., "Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism" in Sakar and Plutynski (eds.), ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Biology'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2008), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology===
{{Main|Epistemology}}
Owing largely to [[Gettier]]'s 1963 paper "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", epistemology resurged as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years. A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier's examples presented to the traditional justified true belief model of knowledge, including developing [[Theory of justification|theories of justification]] in order to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified true belief model. Other and related topics of contemporary research include debates between [[internalism and externalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Bonjour, Laurence, "Recent Work on the Internalism–Externalism Controversy" in Dancy, Sosa, and Steup (eds.), ''A Companion to Epistemology, Second Edition'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; basic knowledge, the nature of [[evidence]], the value of knowledge, [[epistemic luck]], [[virtue epistemology]], the role of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuitions]] in justification, and treating knowledge as a primitive concept.

===Aesthetics===
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
As a result of attacks on the traditional aesthetic notions of beauty and sublimity from [[post-modern]] thinkers, analytic philosophers were slow to consider art and aesthetic judgment. [[Susanne Langer]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Langer]], ''Feeling and Form: A Theory of Art'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nelson Goodman]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nelson Goodman]], ''Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 John Locke lectures.&lt;/ref&gt; addressed these problems in an analytic style during the 1950s and 1960s. Since Goodman, aesthetics as a discipline for analytic philosophers has flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Kivy, Peter, "Introduction: Aesthetics Today" in ''The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2004), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Rigorous efforts to pursue analyses of traditional aesthetic concepts were performed by [[Guy Sircello]] in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in new analytic theories of love,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''Love and Beauty.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; sublimity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]] "How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible?" ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Vol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp.&amp;nbsp;541–550&lt;/ref&gt; and beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''A New Theory of Beauty.'' Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;
